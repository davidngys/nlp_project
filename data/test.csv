"Being a fussy eater is really hard. (I am aware of how first world problems this sounds and I am fully aware of how much of a cock I sound) Since the whole family has been back together for quarantine I’ve been eating more normal people food. I can’t cook to save my life and trust me I’ve tried to learn. I’m starving all the time and I haven’t enjoyed a single meal in weeks. The hunger has kept me in a hangry mood almost permanently and you have to grin and bear food that makes you feel ill to eat because someone has lovingly made it for you and you can’t just refuse a plate of love. 

I’m really getting to my wits end and knowing I’ve got another couple of uk quarantine months to go is driving me slightly insane. I just want to enjoy a meal. Not just swallow everything as quickly as possible for sustenance.

"TIFU by assuming my boyfriend was cheating on me This happened when we first started dating.

His mobile used to ping and light up when someone texted him and once I saw that someone had texted him with the name ""Babe ❤️"" I didn't think of it as anything and that I had not seen it correctly but next coming weeks I saw it happening many times. He would get really happy when the person texted, used to smile really big and all. I started thinking I was being cheated on, the last straw for me was when the person texted ""love you too"" I confronted him about and he stared at me for some time before he started laughing.

I cried because what the hell, so he calmed me down and explained to me that Babe is his grandmother, her name is Baberuth and everyone in the family called her Babe, she recently had gotten her first smartphone and he had taught her to text, so when she texted it was exciting for him to see her using emojis and stuff.

Never felt so embarrassed in my life. A few months later he took me to meet her and I kid you not, for a 85 year old Babe is a sport. Seeing her punch a guy square in the jaw for harassing was a sight. We are best friends now.

TL;DR I assumed my boyfriend was cheating on me but it was just his grandmother texting him.

"Tifu by asking a coworker for help with spanish when neither us speak spanish. I work in an IT repair center and we repair computers from all over the US. Since the US has no official laungauge we get a lot of computers in different laungages, today I got that was in spanish. I know enough spanish to start a conversation but not keep one going, so I used what little spanish I know to get most of the job done. The problem I ran into was with the antivirus. It was blocking my program from running, so I went to my coworker and asked him to turn the anti virus off as it was in spanish and I couldn't read it. He looks at and says "" u don't know what any of this says, this is in spanish""I replied ""oh I'm sorry, I thought you spoke spanish"" embarrassing for both of us I took the walk of shame to the guy less than five feet behind him and asked him since I was directed to him.

"TIFU by not locking my door 
TIFU by not locking my door

So not today but the other day my husband and I were just out of the shower and started to get a little frisky. While we were getting hot and heavy I looked over to our door to make sure it was locked and it was. At least I thought it was. But the problem is my husband changed the door handle a month ago and now it sits in what looks like the lock position. Well needless to say after we were on the bed and I was riding away about to climax, my oldest son comes barging in to tell us about his win he got on his game.... causing both my husband and I to yell out close the door!  Needless to say he saw something he definitely should not have🤦🏽‍♂️.

After my husband sat down and talked to him I think he convinced him that we were just hugging on the bed and were naked from getting out of the shower.

"I think I am being monitored by my older brother I don’t know how, but as soon as I received a laptop in late 2020 (because I needed it for online lessons for quarantine) he asked for it and I gave it to him. He installed this app called AnyDesk which was a Remote Desktop application that allows him access to what I’m seeing and control my laptop. Luckily I caught onto this and uninstalled the program and tried to remove any sort of Remote Desktop access to my laptop. I think I was unsuccessful however since I still feel he is spying on me. He asks me to do certain tasks (such as bid on an eBay listing he puts out) on the laptop specifically and gets really pissed off when I do it on the phone. When I’m watching certain shows or doing certain things he somehow manages to find the right time to enter the room and catch me (not any NSFW stuff because I don’t use that on my laptop because of the paranoia I get). He has control over the network (since my parents don’t really know how these types of stuff works) and tells me to use a specific WiFi booster instead of the normal router. This WiFi booster is closer to him and conveniently closer to me and I do get better WiFi from it. I’m typing this on my phone and my brother doesn’t know about me having Reddit since I hardly use it and have never logged into it on my laptop and only sorta used it for memes or certain tv shows that I like. There are also times where I have caught him (during this quarantine-era specifically) staring at me and watching me until I catch him and then he goes on his phone and pretends he wasn’t doing it.

"TIFU By taking off my shoes on a plane Obligatory this didn't happen today.

Hark back to 2010. A fabulous year of living in a Charity's beach commune in rural Greece. The charity was helping protect/ rescue/ tag loggerhead turtles and their nests. For the five months I was there, shoes were rarely worn. We were staying in an olive grove and worked on a beach.

At the end of the project I had become accustomed to not wearing any footwear at all and when I made my way back to Athens I had to wear something on my feet again. I chose my thongs (flip-flops/ jangles/ sandels/ whatever you call them in your country).

As I made my way to the airport after trekking around Athens for a couple of weeks, while working in the charity rescue centre and doing a lot of sightseeing, the footwear broke. I didn't want to buy another set on the day I was flying out so decided to throw on the old runners (trainers/ sneakers/ tennis shoes/ whatever you call them in your country).

The shoes were really uncomfortable. They were cheap and I hadn't worn them in half a year. They had become dried out to the point of feeling sharp, rigid and uncomfortably stiff, and the material inside wasn't soft at all anymore. The lining on the heel cup had degraded and broken plastic was visible through the crumbling yellow foam.

I got to the airport, checked in, got through security, got to the gate and waited to board the plane. My feet were killing me. I could swear I had given myself open sores or blisters from the material rubbing on my heals because me being dumb, decided socks were for pussies and turns out I am a pussy because my feet were in a lot of pain.

When we got on the plane I was exhausted from partying in the hostel all week. I kicked off my shoes, using my feet to slide them under my seat, laid back with my eyes closed and had a gentle snooze. Finally I could relax.

Then I'm woken up by the staff rather franticly walking up and down the aisle. The plane was still on the tarmac and we were 10 minutes behind schedule. By this time we should have been in the air.

Not long afterwards they start to check the overhead bins. I ask someone what's happening as I couldn't understand the Greek. They reply that there's a weird smell and they believe there might be some sort of device on the plane.

""Device? Smell? The only smell I can get is... Oh no, my shoes!"" I thought to myself. 

I reached under my chair and grab my shoes. ""Quick, get them back on. I don't usually have smelly feet, ever! My feet never smell at all so why are they so bad now?"" I said to myself as I tried to be stealthy putting my stinky shoes back on.

These old shoes had started to stink as badly as any old rancid boot I'd smelt before. It must have been that they were cheap, old, and I didn't wear socks so my feet have been sweating in the seering Greek heat all day. I go to pull them on but my heals are weeping. I had cut them and now putting the shoes back on was agony. I couldn't go on like this.

I decided that I could engineer a fix by going to the toilet, washing my feet and using the hand towels (as they are stronger than toilet tissue) to line the heal of my shoe enough that would be comfortable so I could keep them on for the rest of the flight.

I made my way to the toilet with the shoes in my arms, pressed against my chest to conceal the smell. I get to the toilet door and thank goodness it's not occupied. Immediately an air stewardess approaches and puts her arm infront of the door and blocks me from going in.

""Sir, please take your seat.""

""I really need to go to the toilet.""

""Sir, we are still on the tarmac and we are performing a search on the plane. Please take your seat.""

I decided to lie in order to try and get permission to use the toilet despite them searching the plane. I thought if I pretended it was urgent she would make an exception and let me go.

""I..I have diarrhea, I really need to go now.""

""Sir, please go back to your seat. Try your best to hold it and we will be in the air soon and when the Captain switches off the seatbelt sign you can go.""

""I can't hold it, I need to go now.""

""Sir I won't ask you again...""

At this point two male air stewards approach.

""What's the problem here?"" One asks the stewardess.

""This gentleman is refusing to go back to his seat. He says he has diarrhea.""

""Sir, you have been asked to take your seat. If you don't follow staff instructions we will remove you from the plane.""

At this point I'm done. This isn't worth it. I'm going to go back to my seat and pull on the shoes and sort out the bleeding when the plane takes off. No worries, I can bare it for another 10 minutes or something.

""Ok, I'm sorry. I'll go back to my seat. I'm sorry to cause a problem.""

""Wait! What are you holding?""

""Oh, these are just my shoes.""

""Why aren't they on your feet?""

""My heals are bleeding so I took them off.""

""Why are you taking them to the toilet?""

""To pad the back where they are broken so I can put them on again and they won't make my feet bleed.""

""Pad them with what?""

""Wet hand towels.""

""That won't work. We can get you some bandages (plasters/ band aids/ whatever you call them in your country) from the first aid kit. Please put your shoes back on for now and we will bring them to your seat.""

As soon as I put the shoes down on the floor the air around us is rank with the smell they had thought was a device; they realised it was actually my smelly shoes and started laughing at me.

One of the air stewards followed me back to my seat with a couple of bandages and some wet wipes. He then announced to the plane that the (so far) 25 minute delay to take off had been caused by my stinky feet. I could feel the hate from all around as anyone who could see me stared daggers at me.

I cleaned my cuts, applied the bandages and put my shoes back on, all the while feeling very embarrassed, so stayed low in my chair as the Greeks talked about how much of an asshole I was.

A Greek woman next to me comforted her elderly mother who was crying because she thought that we might not take off in enough time to make their connecting flight. They both stared at me as though I was the devil.

Just when I thought the embarrassment couldn't get any worse, shortly after take off the female flight attendant came up to me and very loudly said
""I know that you have diarrhea so would you like to go to the toilet now?""

Tl;Dr: I took off my shoes on a plane and the smell caused an emergency false alarm which delayed takeoff while I pretended I had diarrhea and incurred the scorn of a plane full of angry Greek

"TIFU by implying to my music teacher that I had emotional trauma related to the song “Take on Me” Okay, so the title pretty much says it all, but hopefully after reading it you’re left with... questions. Anyways, here’s my story.

I was in my sophomore year of high school when this happened. Luckily, the teacher this happened to was a substitute, so there wasn’t any lasting embarrassment. That doesn’t mean this won’t keep me up at night.

I’m neurodivergent (severe ADHD) and I tend to hyperfixate on my own music taste, going on and on about that one part in that one song that makes sad brain produce happy chemical. Unfortunately, the opposite is true for songs I don’t like, as I tend to complain about them to whoever’s unfortunate enough to listen.

I’ve never liked the song Take on Me. It just kinda felt repetitive and annoying. Of course, this wouldn’t be as big of a problem if I didn’t have two younger siblings.

Now I love my siblings with all my heart, but they really do have a way of pissing me off. After hearing one of my tangents about how Take on Me was annoying and overplayed, they conveniently decided that was their new favorite song of all time.

And they would sing it over and over again. Before family dinners. During the chores we were forced to do together. All. The. Damn. Time.

Eventually I got tired of it and told them to stop.

Big mistake.

They would purposefully sing it loudly whenever I’d had a long day, was in a bad mood, or was annoyed about anything.

Over time, Take on Me devolved from “kinda annoying” to “if I have to hear this goddamn song one more time I’m gonna rip off my ears, boil them in holy water, and toss them off a cliff”

Fast forward to sophomore year. I’m in a school choir with about 45-50 other people. We had just gotten back from winter break, and if I wasn’t so filled with Teenage Angst I would probably be excited to see what new song we’d be learning and performing.

When my substitute teacher played the track for our new song, a chill tan down my spine.


It was fucking TAKE ON ME BY A-HA. Acapella edition.


I felt betrayed. I had finally managed to escape this song, that lived in the back of my brain like a storm cloud on the horizon of an otherwise mild sea. This song, with an unmistakable hook that had snared me like a clueless fish looking for a snack. THIS FUCKING SONG, which deceived me with the notion that it was going away for good, only to break into my home in the dead of night and slay me in my sleep.
 
Of course, I started looking for a way to get myself out of having to sing it.

I asked my choir substitute if I could get an exemption, “for personal reasons”. She offered to give me extra help on the parts I found hard, and I replied that I had an issue with the song itself and that “I have a bad memory attached to it”. She apologized profusely and allowed me a pass. I left the class feeling satisfied.

The next day, I was doing homework when my parents came into my room. “We need to talk”

*Apparently, my music teacher thought I might have some kind of trauma related to Take on Me, and called my parents because she was worried about me.*

Mortified, I had to explain the whole scenario to my parents, who were trying hard to contain their laughter.

I ended up having to sing it like everyone else. I hated it, but at least it’s over. 

I’ve had my fair share of embarrassing moments, but most of them, like the infamous Bus Incident, were funny in retrospect and I can still laugh about it with my friends. This one haunts me so much that it stays only between me, myself, and the 330 million strangers on Reddit.

ADHD is fun, y’all!

"TIFU by teaching rhymes to my 4yo. This happened 2 hours ago and is still on going. My daughter and I sat down for breakfast. She wanted me to sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. So i did. She requested it again and again. 

I knew where this was going so i changed up the lyrics. She was taken by surprise and laughed and we started going back and fourth rhyming words. 

Long story short i ended up rhyming a word with ""fart"" and she laughed and laughed. It is the most she had laughed in a while. So I did it again to even more laughter. So she tried and we both laughed.  

Well. Now she thinks she has the ultimate key to comedy. She has been singing and ""telling jokes"" for the past two hours. 

The latest version is: ""Twinkle twinkle little zebra, how I wonder fart fart fart.""

The last joke went something like: ""Why did the elephant drive a car? Because the cat farted and it smelled like a fart.""

I told her that her joke stinks and she snorted. Her retort? ""Because a fart came out of my mouth."" To which I said ""Eww"" and laughed... which only seems to have emboldened her stand-up routine.

"TIFU by using body wash as moisturizer So this all started 3 days ago when I asked my mom to get me new shampoo, body wash and moisturizer. My skin was feeling pretty dry and I was feeling really uncomfortable. A few hours later, I walked in the bathroom and 2 brand-new bottles were sitting on the counter. So in a rush, I took the bottle that had the word ""moisturize"" on it and spread the contents all over my body. The first day I applied it, I had no issues.

But next morning, I woke up and I had these rashes around the creases of my elbows and my ballsack felt odd, but I thought nothing of it. I assumed it was just the moisturizer doing its work, so I applied the moisturizer again all over my body. And when I say all over my body, I mean everywhere. All the nooks and crannies, all the corners. You name it; it was moisturized.

I woke up the next day and I immediately felt this weird pain in my scrotum, and then I looked down and saw this monstrosity of a ballsack that looked like a leather bag made from the skin of a crocodile. The skin was so dry, it looked like my balls traveled to space without a spacesuit. Every time I moved, I could feel my rigid skin trying to fold itself and it hurt. 

At this point, I knew something was wrong, so I told my mom to never buy this moisturizer again because my balls were allergic to it. But then she said ""What moisturizer? I didn't buy a moisturizer."" Then it dawned on me. There were only two bottles sitting on my bathroom counter back then. I went back to my bathroom to look at the bottles and one bottle turned out to be a shampoo and the other was a body wash that proudly explains that it moisturizes and hydrates your skin. I had been using a body wash as a moisturizer for the past 3 days.

"TIFU badly by waking up late. Generally I never post on reddit, but today I have to. That too in this subreddit. Allow me to vent out. 

So I work in one big multinational company which focuses on client service. Yesterday night at 1:02AM, manager informed on group of sudden roster change and I was in the new roster. That time I was awake and I accepted the roster. I had to report to office by morning 8AM. 

Then a very nice sleep followed by and I woke up directly at 10AM and after waking up I was wondering something is fucked up and then I remembered I had to go office. Checked my phone and there were 50+ missed calls, messages and what not. I did not say anything and went to office by 11:30AM. 

Welcomed very nicely by my team by calling lazy ass and manager called me in his cabin and he gave piece of his mind. I said sorry and promised this will not happen again. But it was too late because manager called another staff because of my unexpected absense. 

Now I am sitting at home for 1 week and that too without pay just because I woke up late. I am not included in this week’s roster till saturday and on top of that, no pay. 

Man. Sleep really fucked me up. Can’t help. I feel very very guilty for my mistake and I haven’t been able to smile in front of my team and at home, my parents.  This really sucks.

"TIFU by taking ""You won't like this"" literally. Over the years when it comes to certain foods at family reunions, Sunday dinners, or at a BBQ hosted by friends, people tasting things will sometimes tell me that I will not like it, along with a funny smile or smirk of a sort.

Since these people are of course trusted family and friends, I took them at their word and simply did not taste or eat the food they pointed out. After all, they are just looking out for me and I have no reason to suspect or question their word on such a simple thing such as food. There was almost always plenty of other food to eat.

Today, I find out they have all freaking lied to me. Decided to eat something anyways and omg was it delicious.

Years of unknown regret rained on me when someone explained to me the phrase *you won't like this* means you will **love** it.

TL:DR; Anytime anyone said I won't like something, I didn't eat it.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'taking', 'you', ""won't"", 'like', 'this', 'literally', 'over', 'the', 'years', 'when', 'it', 'comes', 'to', 'certain', 'foods', 'at', 'family', 'reunions', 'sunday', 'dinners', 'or', 'at', 'bbq', 'hosted', 'by', 'friends', 'people', 'tasting', 'things', 'will', 'sometimes', 'tell', 'me', 'that', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'it', 'along', 'with', 'funny', 'smile', 'or', 'smirk', 'of', 'sort', 'since', 'these', 'people', 'are', 'of', 'course', 'trusted', 'family', 'and', 'friends', 'took', 'them', 'at', 'their', 'word', 'and', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'taste', 'or', 'eat', 'the', 'food', 'they', 'pointed', 'out', 'after', 'all', 'they', 'are', 'just', 'looking', 'out', 'for', 'me', 'and', 'have', 'no', 'reason', 'to', 'suspect', 'or', 'question', 'their', 'word', 'on', 'such', 'simple', 'thing', 'such', 'as', 'food', 'there', 'was', 'almost', 'always', 'plenty', 'of', 'other', 'food', 'to', 'eat', 'today', 'find', 'out', 'they', 'have', 'all', 'freaking', 'lied', 'to', 'me', 'decided', 'to', 'eat', 'something', 'anyways', 'and', 'omg', 'was', 'it', 'delicious', 'years', 'of', 'unknown', 'regret', 'rained', 'on', 'me', 'when', 'someone', 'explained', 'to', 'me', 'the', 'phrase', 'you', ""won't"", 'like', 'this', 'means', 'you', 'will', 'love', 'it', 'tl', 'dr', 'anytime', 'anyone', 'said', ""won't"", 'like', 'something', ""didn't"", 'eat', 'it']",tifu by taking you won't like this literally over the years when it comes to certain foods at family reunions sunday dinners or at bbq hosted by friends people tasting things will sometimes tell me that will not like it along with funny smile or smirk of sort since these people are of course trusted family and friends took them at their word and simply did not taste or eat the food they pointed out after all they are just looking out for me and have no reason to suspect or question their word on such simple thing such as food there was almost always plenty of other food to eat today find out they have all freaking lied to me decided to eat something anyways and omg was it delicious years of unknown regret rained on me when someone explained to me the phrase you won't like this means you will love it tl dr anytime anyone said won't like something didn't eat it,tifu by taking you won't like this literally over the year when it come to certain food at family reunion sunday dinner or at bbq hosted by friend people tasting thing will sometimes tell me that will not like it along with funny smile or smirk of sort since these people are of course trusted family and friend took them at their word and simply did not taste or eat the food they pointed out after all they are just looking out for me and have no reason to suspect or question their word on such simple thing such a food there wa almost always plenty of other food to eat today find out they have all freaking lied to me decided to eat something anyways and omg wa it delicious year of unknown regret rained on me when someone explained to me the phrase you won't like this mean you will love it tl dr anytime anyone said won't like something didn't eat it,tifu by take you won't like thi liter over the year when it come to certain food at famili reunion sunday dinner or at bbq host by friend peopl tast thing will sometim tell me that will not like it along with funni smile or smirk of sort sinc these peopl are of cours trust famili and friend took them at their word and simpli did not tast or eat the food they point out after all they are just look out for me and have no reason to suspect or question their word on such simpl thing such as food there wa almost alway plenti of other food to eat today find out they have all freak lie to me decid to eat someth anyway and omg wa it delici year of unknown regret rain on me when someon explain to me the phrase you won't like thi mean you will love it tl dr anytim anyon said won't like someth didn't eat it
"TIFU lying about my porn Twitter TLDR: GF found Twitter account that I follow &amp; like girls posting sexual stuff. I get defensive and lie about it, then admit everything. She wants to leave me, losing trust in me and feeling used.

So I may have a slight porn addiction idk. But basically I’ve recently had a mini relapse into my twitter account where I followed people who post and like their photos. My reasoning is I like it and show them support so they continue. I also use this account for those giveaways where you retweet and like posts. 

So my gf who likes to stalk my exes and stuff’s social media because he’s insecure and somehow made it a hobby, was on my phone doing her normal surface level lurk and she found that Twitter was logged into an account and she stopped and later asked me about it.

Essentially I admitted to it, but lie that I haven’t really used it recently but mostly for giveaways. And I’m getting defensive because this isn’t something I’m proud of. I’ve always told her everything though, but how would i ever fit in “oh I have a porn account” into a conversation? 

I probe her to ask how she feels: betrayed? Disappointed? And she asked me to bring up the profile and looks how recent&amp; often I’ve liked photos. She’s not upset cause more recent and looks. She’s distraught telling me I ruined her trust in me since I tell her I’m tired everyday. (I work but trying to learn/start up a side hustle). Also saying I’m ruining her self confidence, something I’ve been trying to build with her, and she feels used like sex toy. Now I admit I am attracted to her. The “twitter girls” are different than her, but I’ve never held her to those standards. I honestly prefer her body type, but I do get turned on by the “twitter girl” body type as well. 

Now that it’s all out that I’ve lied and tried to hide this. She wants to break up with me. I feel guilty and selfish and idk my next step except post here to get out what’s on my chest.

"Sometimes I get really depressed thinking about how much better my life could be if I was rich My life is already decent and I'm pretty happy. I have a great supportive family and we're not struggling financially(we were when I was a child which might be where this feeling is coming from) but we don't have enough money to spend on expensive hobbies and such. I'm in my early 20s and going to university while working but I don't make much. It just sucks to think about how the best years of my life could be so much better if I had more money. I could invest in every single hobby i'm interested in and maybe I'd find something I'm talented at or something I really really enjoy but I'm too afraid to spend money on hobbies even if I have it because I might realize that I don't enjoy them and then I'll have wasted all of this money. It makes me really sad to think about the fact that if I ever were to make enough money to spend freely I'll probably be older, my body won't be able to handle as much, I might have kids and other responsibilities, less free time, etc. I won't get this time back and I hate knowing that I could be so much happier and more successful if I had more money. I'd be able to go all in with something I'm interested in and maybe even start making money from it but since it's always a risk I don't feel comfortable spending that much money on stuff like that.

"TIFU by celebrating Halloween in a country that doesn’t celebrate Halloween Obligatory this didn’t happen today, but rather 17 years-ish ago.

So as the headline mentions, I live in a country that doesn’t celebrate Halloween. Now being that some of my friends and I grew up in the US and Halloween is an awesome holiday, we throw a big party every year and invite everyone we know. It’s always a blast.

A year before said party took place, a few people tried to get it on in my dad’s room, and I had to kick them out feeling very uncomfortable with the situation. So, learning from past experiences, we set up a nice cozy bed in the basement, and lit some candles for a romantic atmosphere.

Cut to the party.

We’re all having a great time. There were some awesome costumes. One of my friends dressed up like a zombie, but since his GF’s sister was a professional makeup artist, it looked pretty bad ass.

Suddenly, we see flames coming out the small basement window. Apparently, one of the candles was directly below a very-flammable sleeping bag.

Now, if a fire about to burn down my house wasn’t bad enough, the flames were also growing extremely close to my old army bag, which also held a few mags of live ammo.

My zombie-dressed friend was the fastest to react. He ran down to the basement and extinguished the flames with an old carpet. That was the end of that.

The party continued and we were all getting good and drunk. So when my friend kept saying that his hands kinda hurt, we laughed it off. After a while, we realized his hands were badly burned and he really needed medical care. Luckily, I lived very close to a hospital so no one had to drive.

This would be a good time to note that at the time this story happened, terrorist bombings were part of our ever day life. So when my friend came in, ripped up “bloody” clothes and way-too-realistic zombie makeup on, the whole hospital freaked out thinking there was another attack. Nobody thought about Halloween, because no one here celebrates Halloween. When they ran to him, asking him if he was ok and what happened, he just showed them his hands and said that he burned them. They were very confused.

tl;dr – had a Halloween party in a country that doesn’t celebrate Halloween, almost burned down my house with a candle, a friend who had professional zombie makeup on put out the flames, we took him to the hospital because he burnt his hands and his costume freaked the whole hospital out because I live in a country that used to have a lot of terrorist attacks.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'celebrating',

"I Hate Myself. I am not suicidal, but I hate myself.

I did very stupid things years ago when I was younger that I can never forget because how bad It makes me feel, I accidentally bought something in a game with my Parents money (they found out instantly), I can't wrap my head around conversations where I clearly did something wrong like the previous thing, for example I love being Honest but when something happens like that When I try to explain and everything I start spilling out hard to understand things that get misinterpreted and all. I also hate that when I was very young I was tormenting my dog for like 2 minutes because how stupid I was not knowing what I was doing many many years ago, I made my dog scared of me and after that day never did it again, and I hope that she forgave me because after that ever since I gave nothing else to her but love. Then I am very sensitive,   I couldn't stand the thought of losing back then and I was a sore loser, but then It got better into a way where I was mad about losing but that all my effort I gave into what I did failed and then was misinterpreted, has I am a Sore loser. IMy parents say they are proud of me but, I just can't believe it after how I always argued with my dad for almost every weekend for a year because of Video Games. I hate how I lost the motivation to do work last year and resulted in me Procrastinating and not meeting Mastery in math by the end of this semester. I hate myself because of these things I have done, and I want to change has much has possible to hide the fact that I was a kid like this, I want to be like a stranger when I talk to my friends next time because I don't want to remember these thing, but I hate that I also do not want to because I have to own up to what I did do and I hate that it will stick with me. Most of all that I hate is that I made accidents happen when I should have been careful, I should have been smarter, but I wasn't.

"TIFU by falling asleep wearing earbuds So our story begins in March of 2020 (10 months ago). 
One fateful night, I was posted up in bed, listening to music with earbuds (the kind with the little rubber pieces that go in your ear (this is important)).  My usual plan when I do this is to, at some point before I fall asleep, remove the earbuds from my ears, and fall asleep, so as not to damage the earbuds. This was not a very realistic plan, and almost every night I did this, I would fall asleep with the earbuds in.
Usually this did not cause any problems, as the earbuds would gradually make their way out of my ears over the course of the night, and I would retrieve them from out of my blankets in the morning. 
This March morning was no exception, and I woke up without earbuds in my ears. While retrieving the ear buds from my blankets, I noticed that one of the little rubber bits was missing. I didn’t think much of it, as I lose them all the time and I had plenty of extras, so I replaced the rubber bit. However at that point I started to notice a shooting pain in my right ear. It felt like I had ruptured my ear drum again (I ruptured both ear drums on 2 separate occasions over the course of the previous year), so I went to my University’s Student Health Center. 
The NP there didn’t see anything wrong with my ear, but she gave me some ear drops which I used. 
A few weeks later it had not gotten any better, so I went to urgent care. Same result, doctor didn’t see anything, gave me ear drops. 
Repeat one more time after another couple of weeks. 

At this point I had really stopped caring about it. I had gotten used to the pain and the lack of hearing, and I didn’t think about it until maybe last month. 

Last month my hearing in my right ear got noticeably worse overnight. It didn’t even cross my mind to go see a doctor until yesterday, so I made an appointment with a real ENT doctor for this afternoon. 

Fast forward to the doctor sticking medical instruments in my ear. 

Dude asks, while looking inside my left ear (Not the one that hurts) if I wore earbuds often. I told him I had not worn earbuds since March, the day I noticed this pain.  He says ok, and moves to my other side. 

He starts removing some wax, then asks once more,

“When was the last time you wore earbuds?”

“March”, I said.

“That’s when the issue started?”, he asked.

“Yes”

“Well I think I found the root of the problem”

Doctor shows me the rubber earbud bit he had just pulled out of my ear. I am now laughing hysterically.

The doctor was really nice, we were both joking about it, and now I can actually hear out of my right ear. I feel like a new man. 

I’ll put a related picture in the comments. 

TL;DR: Fell asleep wearing earbuds one night, felt a strange pain in my ear the next morning. Didn’t realize for 10 months that there had been a rubber earbud thingy lodged in my ear canal.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'falling', 'asleep', 'wearing', 'earbuds', 'so', 'our', 'story', 'begins', 'in',

For examples, blacks get a gold star if they've never been to prison or have less than two baby daddies/mamas or graduated high school or never have been to prison before they turn 21. People expect blacks to fail and fuck up. All those white rioters were just acting like black people do.

"TIFU by jacking off leaving my door unlocked Happened minutes ago.

I just finished an 8 hour long gaming session with my friends and thought, ""time to go to bed"" .

Having my phone always at arms length, I wanted to do a fast wank and sleep comfortably. Oh boy was I wrong.

Sheets covering me, phone on my hand, my dick in the other, sheets slowly falling off. I was doing my thing and didn't bother covering. I heard creaking and looked at my door.

*I don't have the best vision of the doorway because of some furniture*

I saw the door open slightly and close again.
I look and see that the gap where my genitals were completely showcase everything to the doorway.

I am not sure who looked inside my room,  I am sure the following weeks I won't be able to get my thing up due to fear, I'm also reeeally looking forward to the awkward encounter with whomever peeked inside my room.


TL;DR 
After gaming all day, decided to jack off so I can sleep easier. Left my door unlocked and saw the door open and close slowly.

"TIFU by trying LSD and loving it, but also running it for myself in the process. So as a kid I had some seriously fucked up nightmares. My body would wake up but my brain thought it was asleep and would use wherever I was as a setting for a nightmare. Most of them I had no memory of. Sometimes I could only remember fragments just like an actual dream.



The full on night terrors that I remember were generally the same - I would be somewhere in the house and see spiders crawling in every corner of the ceiling. I also felt them crawling on my tongue and I'm scratching my tongue to get them off. I'm terrified so I'm calling for Mum and Dad but it's these two strangers telling me everything's alright but I don't know them, where are my Mum and Dad? They say they are my Mum and Dad but they aren't so I start screaming but the spiders are still on my tongue! Somehow I'm in the bathroom so I try washing my mouth to get rid of the spiders. My hands start feeling weird and I see my fingers swelling up to the size of sausages. Meanwhile the spiders on the ceiling are getting closer.


I've had a handful of times where it would happen in the middle of the day even when I hadn't been sleeping, something would trigger in my brain and I'd feel myself slipping then BAM sausage fingers. I grew out of it. My last one was when I was about 12.


20years down the track to last weekend I took LSD and mid-trip I get an old familiar feeling, that slipping feeling, and my hands felt funny...I looked down saw my good ol' sausage fingers again! No spiders though. Hoping it stays that way for future trips.


So turns out what I pay to experience now, my brain used to be able to do for free. With my old night terrors in the front of my mind I'm worried my next trip will be a bad one revisiting my old night terrors. Great.


TLDR: I only just discovered the wonderous world of psychedelics and learned the freaky shit I used to see as a kid were hallucinations so I'm reluctant to do it again in case I see some of my more terrifying childhood hallucinations (spiders on the ceiling and in my mouth).",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'trying', 'lsd', 'and', 'loving', 'it', 'but', 'also', 'running', 'it', 'for', 'myself', 'in', 'the',

Ever since I was a kid I've been not entirely straight.  I grew up in a very catholic, Italian family, and though my direct family is accepting, something like this would not sit well with the extended family.  The main reason it's been a secret my whole life, though, is due to the fact that I've always been part of the crowd of kids that although aren't homophobic, might reject me if they found out my secret.  Im in a great fraternity at a great school and if any of my brothers found out I would be looked at very weirdly.  As terrible as it is, I care a lot about what people think of me, so just telling them isn't an option if I want to maintain the close friendships I have.  Both my high school friends and college friends are great people that I am extremely close with, so please don''t tell me they aren't my ""real friends"" due to the fact that I'd be ostracized if they found out I wasn't entirely straight.  I've never told a soul, not even the girls I've dated (currently in a great, loving relationship), but I can't die with this secret.  So, giiven the state of the world, im just gonna come out here on an alt just to finally get this off my chest.  I get that im a super closeted freak but I simply don't have the balls to let anybody in my life know this.

"I don't know why, but I kind of find the way Joe and Peach treat Beck in ""You"" to be... Attractive? First of all, ""You"" is a Netflix show about a guy who stalks a girl to learn more about her while paving the way for a relationship with her. It's not as cutesy as the description sounds. 

Second of all, there's spoilers in this post for Season 1 so don't read this if you don't want anything ruined.

Alright. So. Beck is the female protagonist. Joe is the male protagonist. Peach is one of Beck's friends and later in the season we find out she's also in love with Beck, though in denial. But here's the thing.

Joe stole Beck's phone, broke into her apartment several times and stole several items, hacked into her laptop, constantly followed and spied on her even when they were dating, dug into her life with social media, and was downright obsessed with her. Hell his narration was *all* talking to Beck, even though she wasn't present. Shit he even killed people he deemed as having hurt her (like her ex, Benji). 

He did a lot of shit wrong. I'm not excusing his actions, because they're fucked up. But at the same time, like, he was *absolutely* dedicated to Beck. She cheated on him outright as well as slept with other guys when they were kinda dating (things weren't official so more power to her, but from Joe's perspective it was kind of cheating. Definitely betraying). And yet despite everything she did that would typically set off someone who was obsessed with you, he instead ""forgave"" her. Brushed it off so long as she affirmed she loved him. He put in so much effort to take care of her. Everything he did was motivated to raise Beck up and help her fulfill her dreams. 

And Peach? Peach was wealthy af and often patronized/was condescending towards Beck, treating her more like a pet than a friend some days. But she still wanted to care for Beck and help her pursue her dream of writing. She wanted to give Beck whatever would help her, in return for her love and companionship. Peach was very manipulative and also creepy with the secret semi nude pics she'd take of Beck, but still. 

I'm not gonna lie and say I 100% wanna be in one of these situations, because Peach drugged Beck and kissed her without her consent, knowing Beck was straight and gaslighting Beck when she brought it up later. And Joe straight up murdered Peach and Beck lmao. Not a happy ending for either. 

But I find the ideas of a) having someone so completely devoted while treating me like a person and willing to do *anything* to take care of me or b) being a hot rich chick's pet appealing. It doesn't help that the actors for Joe and Peach are 100% my type. If they were played by other people (blondes, for instance. Sorry guys) I doubt I'd be that interested. 

That said, I realise I'd be suffocated in the first situation (or more accurately, strangled) or bored in the second. And yet, I still find myself fantasizing what I'd do if I were in Beck's shoes. 

Also I can't stand Beck's character.

"Tifu By not confessing that this dude's fiancèe in college would participate in frequent group sex with our athletic team after meeting him face to face. This happened in college some time back and I had no, fucking, idea... I creeped on her after a memory came up on FB of our last new years together in school. They have kids and have now been married for 5 years. 

We'll refer to her as Liz.

Liz was a part of the woman's sports team at my college. She got around a bit through my team and eventually formed a truple with another teammate and me. We'd all see other people but for the most part we would go home together.

My friend and I later found out she was engaged and had been for almost a year. I met her BF while her and I were sitting tables for our athletic volunteer hours. They dated for 4 years or so prior.

She did have a ring but switched fingers frequently since her fingers would swell from some condition. It wasn't flashy or anything, so we all just thought it was a family heirloom or something. 

Her fiance came up to the tables joking and then he hugged and kissed her. My eyes went up but I didn't want to say anything. I really didn't know what to say... Like, ""aye man, my dude and I gangbanged your fiancèe"". Why would he believe me over her? Thinking back now I could have shown him her pics but it all happened so quick and I was so shocked.

After I met him I hoped and prayed that something would happen so that he found out about everyone she's been sleeping with on the side. But there is no happy ending to this story.

I bring this up because they look so damn happy and he was so fucking clueless when he came up to me at the table. It legit hurt my heart knowing that she could be so, idk what to call it...

People really can just look someone dead in the eye, tell them they love them, then go have a full on secret gangbang. I just, never want to date. Trust issues from that situation really fucked me up.

How can you even tell when someone is genuine? It's like a legit leap of faith.

Tl;dr: teammate and I would have regular group sex with someone on the woman's athletic team not knowing that she was engaged. Found out by meeting him face to while we all were sitting tables, he didn't know and didn't find out from what I can tell. They're married now with multiple kids.

Edit:. I have zero intentions on bringing this up to him ever. This was more so a, you can never really know a person.  

Also I know he didn't know because I confronted her later that night and she told me to mind my business. That was our last interaction. I'd think of he knew she would have just said that. Things were really good between us prior to that event.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'not', 'confessing', 'that', 'this', ""dude's"", 'fiancèe', 'in', 'college', 'would', 'participate', 'in', 'frequent',

"TIFU by not keeping my mouth shut at the dentist Several years ago I moved and had to find a new dentist. I had 4 cavities I’d been putting off for a while, so the dentist agreed to fill them all at once. The appointment was scheduled for 2 hours, later in the day, after work.

I normally snack on a granola bar every day at work. The store was out of my regular kind, so I’d bought some chocolate banana bars. They were DELICIOUS. I couldn’t help myself, and I ended up eating the entire box.

On my way to the dentist, my stomach was very unhappy. I was extremely bloated. The gas came quickly, and I spent the entire drive pushing out what I could, windows down, sweating. I was getting nervous as I parked, hoping it would stop. That’s when I read the box.

They were FIBER BARS.

But it was too late. The hygienist got me set up in the chair, put the nose piece on for the nitrous, and said she’d be right back. I took that as my final fart break and let loose. The smell was so bad I smelled it IMMEDIATELY, even with the nose piece on. The hygienist came back and did a full stop at the doorway before hesitantly proceeding.

Over the next two hours, I emitted a steady stream of toxic waste. I mean two straight hours of hot silent farts. The dentist seemed weirdly unbothered, but the hygienist excused herself several times. Towards the end, she told him “I’m sorry, I just... I can’t” and didn’t come back. He did the fillings while holding the suction hose himself for most of it.

I was so mortified that I didn’t go back there for over a year. When I finally did, I was hoping they’d forgotten. But as soon as I walked in, the hygienist (who also functions as a receptionist) knew my name. I figured she remembered me due to my horrific gas leak, so I apologized. Turns out she didn’t remember the incident, she remembered me because I drool like a Saint Bernard (this is true, it runs down my face, it gets everywhere). She laughed, I died a little inside.

I really like that dentist, so I decided to leave him a good review on Google. It basically summarized what happened and said they were very professional about it.

At my next visit, my dentist mentioned it immediately, laughing about it. He told me he has no sense of smell. He had no idea it even happened. The hygienist had blamed her leaving on a medical issue or something, and didn’t rat me out.

I should have just kept my mouth shut.

TLDR: Ate a whole box of fiber bars before a long dentist appointment, leaked hot farts the entire time, didn’t go back for a while, figured they remembered, turns out dentist didn’t even know and found out from my review.

Edit: Holy crap, I picked the wrong night to forget to charge my phone and this thing got way more attention than anticipated. I am so happy that so many of you got a laugh out of this. Thank you to the people who pointed out that she was a dental assistant rather than a hygienist, I wasn’t really sure what title to use for her when I made the post. Also, I am female, and a small one at that, which I somehow feel makes this funnier. Keep being awesome Reddit, and shout out to all the people who find farts just as funny as I do!",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'not', 'keeping', 'my', 'mouth', 'shut', 'at', 'the', 'dentist', 'several', 'years',

"TIFU by setting off a rooster So this is still happening as i type this.

About 10 mins ago my friend and I decided to go cycling, so while waiting for him to get ready i decided to get the bikes out of the shed and have a quick look at his chickens. He has 5 hens and a big rooster that usually sits there quietly looking out on his mini kingdom. I thought that it would be a fun idea to see what reaction the chickens would have to me playing some chicken noises from YT, and this is where the problem begins. I clicked the first video on the list which was a rooster crowing, the moment the rooster heard the video, he started crowing loudly and screaming like a 5 year old on Christmas morning. He wont stop and its loud enough to be heard from the next street over. I have googled how to get him to stop but short of wringing his neck and having him for dinner, there is no way to shut him up.

"TIFU by eating in my room as if I hadn't just moved in and left everything packed and messy. Just happened.

My family is nearly done moving. Everyone's rooms are more or less finished except for mine. Boxes and clothes and objects are strewn about because I can't decide where to put what, and it's hard to move around the room. That kind of messy. While I'm slowly getting there I could definitely stand to pick up the pace.

My mom got on me about it some half-hour ago because a relative wants to see our new place tomorrow. Told me to try and finish tonight. I'm like,

&gt;Fine, but not before this can of *sardines*.

You know how you have to pull the lid up carefully because it flicks drops of sardine juice back at you?

I somehow flung the whole fucking can off my desk in the process and there's just sardine juice on a lot of stuff now. Wouldn't have been as bad had I just finished unpacking and putting everything away. At least then I could just mop the floor and wash my bed sheets. But nOoOoOoOo, not on my watch apparently.

I'm putting the sardines in the fridge. I don't even want to look at them right now. Just gonna finish cleaning while I sulk about it.

"TIFU By poisoning my family with green potatoes  So as if the cheesecake incident wasn't bad enough, I tried to make mashed potatoes last week and made both of my parents sick. For a little bit of background, I like to bake more than I like to cook, and I know more about baking than cooking.

So we had five potatoes that'd been in the kitchen for about ten or so days and I decided I'd use them to make mashed potatoes. I'd never made mashed potatoes from scratch before, but I knew what I needed so I thought it'd be great. So I cut them up and boil them, then comes the first set back. I can't find the masher. No big deal, I decided I'll chop them up more finely and use a hand whisk and fork to mix them with my butter and milk.

At this point my dad comes home and asks what I'm doing. I tell him and let him taste the potatoes (which I was still trying to mix at this point). He says they taste undercooked, so I decide okay no big deal, and pop them in the microwave for a while. This goes on until I've microwaved these potatoes for about ten minutes (I'd boiled them for about 40 minutes to begin with). By now they look good, and to me they taste edible to me. Admittedly they weren't great, but I figured it was just a lack of butter and salt (combined with the fact they'd been microwaved so much), so I add some more of each and I'm satisfied.

My parents both try the potatoes again and say the same thing, they smell and taste green. At this point I'm convinced they are not undercooked, so now I'm out five potatoes and about an hour and half over all. I ended up eating a scope of them myself (And I could taste what they meant about the green, though I couldn't smell it.) and throwing the rest away. I wish that'd been the end of it.

The rest of the night and next day both my parents feel sick to their stomach, are having slight diarrhea, and have headaches. I felt perfectly fine, and since I ate the most of the potatoes my first assumption wasn't the potatoes were to blame. Then I looked up if green potatoes were safe to eat... and lucky me they aren't. Apparently they have solanine, which can make people dangerously sick.

TL;DR: I made my parents sick with solanine and I guess my body just told it to fuck off since I've been perfectly fine.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'poisoning', 'my', 'family', 'with', 'green', 'potatoes',

"Not so much a confession, but I need to get it out there. It's not unusual for me to have sex dreams, even ones about women I know. But last night I had one and for some reason it has me feeling weird. It was about my wife's best friend, who is also one of my closest friends that I have known for years. There's never been any kind of sexual chemistry between us, real or imagined, and this just kind of came out of nowhere. 

Normally when I have one of these I just move on, its just a dream after all. But I don't know why, this just felt...different? I don't want to do anything in real life and I don't suspect this will impact our friendship in any way, it was just weird. And obviously telling my wife about it would be an absolute non-starter.

"TIFU by almost killing my grandpa and splitting up the family For some background context, I’m a 20 (m) trying to become a physician. Just the other day, I was going to a family gathering very social distanced for New Years with my cousins and grandparents included. Every year we do this as tradition so this year was the same (even though  I didn’t want to go but wanted to see my grandma again as she has breast cancer and won’t live much longer.) It was around 10:00 pm when dinner was finally being put on the grill and we had 4 rib eyes. Both of my grandparents are in their late 80s and are getting very weak and fragile. As the steaks were being served, we all went far apart with our families. Not 2 minutes after we started eating, my grandpa started to choke and his face was getting red. Everyone started to panic, and as someone who knows the Heimlich maneuver, I ran over trying to keep my composure. While I was running over, I tripped and knocked my grandpa out of his seat causing all the other family to panic and yell at me. At this point I was freaking out but didn’t show and I started to perform the maneuver. I got the steak out of his mouth but he couldn’t move so we called an ambulance. Earlier today I found I broke his collar bone and dislocated his spine and he is getting surgery today. All of my aunts and uncles are very mad at me and even one of my cousins came over and tried to fight me. I am currently freaking out and hoping my grandpa is gonna be alright. 

TL;DR I tripped trying to save my grandpa from choking and broke his collar bone and spine.

Edit: Thank you guys so much for the support and kind words. For those of you who are wondering, I went to the hospital this morning and both grandparents are extremely grateful. I’m told my grandpa will take a while to recover. I also got into a fight with my uncle for making my grandpa get injured. Mind you, he is roughly late 50s so I tried not to fight him that much. Once again, thank you guys for all your support!

"TIFU by smashing my glass dildo I’m currently on holiday with the family, staying in swanky accommodation that my aunt, who is fairly well off, owns. Earlier today I went for a run and went to shower afterwards. I was kinda in the mood for a wank so I grabbed my fave dildo (she’s so beautiful) and satisfyer pro into the (ceramic tiled!!) bathroom. I stupidly put my pile of clothes, towel and sex toys beside the sink, and went to lock the door behind me. In that time, the glass dildo slipped and clattered (LOUDLY) to the floor, smashing cleanly into two pieces. I’m positive the whole house would have heard it, the noise was ridiculous and all the other rooms were open.  As I went to open the bathroom door to inconspicuously stash the pieces in my room, I could hear my dad call “what was that!?” from the other side. I stuffed the pieces behind me in the waistband of my leggings, said “nothing, don’t worry!” and prayed he wouldn’t interrogate me more. I’m sure he thought I smashed something expensive of my aunt’s, but thankfully he didn’t pry any further.. narrowly avoided an extremely awkward encounter and still mourning the loss of my best dildo ever ❤️

"My perception of femininity is permanently ruined... I'll try keep this as brief as possible, but there's a td;lr at the bottom just in case.

I am a 20 year old straight asexual male. I have never cared about sex, have never craved it, and have never masturbated to porn. However, I am still romantically attracted to women. This isn't a problem with me, but this information will make sense in a second.

Despite being straight, for as long as I can remember (around middle school is my earliest memory), I have *always* been fascinated by women's clothes. It started off with an interest in dresses, then skirts, and now just any type of feminine attire. This interest isn't in the fashion side of things; it's in wearing these dresses and skirts etc. Like my asexuality, I am okay with this, however from this desire stems the problem I face today.

While exploring my new fantasy throughout high school, I made the mistake of associating arousal with wearing girl's clothes. The thought of it would make me curious and erect, and it was to these thoughts that I began masturbating to as a teen. It started off as completely non-sexual thoughts, and I got off to stories about guys being dressed as girls. From there, I began running out of material and craved more exciting stories. So, I started reading into the forced feminization stories that the internet had to offer. I still only cared about the dressing up part, however the fact that these stories started to involve sex is what really fucked up my brain. The more I craved, the worse the stories got, and the further my fantasy of dressing as a girl went from pure innocence to horny desires.

Eventually, I got bored of stories; I needed the visual appeal too. This was my next mistake. These now sexual stories lead me to watching FtM porn and for the first time (despite being asexual), I was masturbating to videos of sexual acts. And I'll be honest, I would do **anything** in the world to erase all of this and just think like a normal guy my age.

Anyways, you're probably thinking, ""but you can just leave those fantasies in your head and not associate them with your romance life when you find a partner, right?"". Wrong. Even though I'm a guy, I secretly still want to dress up as a girl, express my femininity from time to time, and be happy about it. My best female friend has put make-up on me in the past and I absolutely loved it. Some of my other female friends occasionally braid my hair and it looks super feminine and I *love* it. The only problem is, I could never do anything more than that in my current mental state.

Whenever my friends do those things, I can still feel myself get aroused *without even thinking about it.* If I were to try on a dress for the first time in my life, my erect manhood would make it obvious that something's up, despite me just wanting to dress up and feel pretty and fabulous for once. When I see a cute dress, I get aroused **but I don't want to.** Whenever I'm at a party, all I can think about is how awesome it'd be to wear what the girls are wearing, **but my dick wants more than that.** I subconsciously relate my perception of femininity with all the stories and video's I've gotten off to, and I'm just permanently stuck thinking like that. I have no idea how to change that, and I don't think I can..

So yeah, that's my very messed up situation. If there was somehow a way for me to live life as a guy, but shamelessly express my feminine side from time to time without getting hard again, I'd jump on that opportunity in a heartbeat. I just wish I wasn't like this...

TL;DR: I wanna occasionally dress like a girl and express my feminine side but over the years I have learnt to associate these thoughts with masturbating, so now I always get aroused at everything feminine despite just wanting to live these fantasies in an innocent, non-sexual way.",0,"['my', 'perception', 'of', 'femininity', 'is', 'permanently', 'ruined', ""i'll"", 'try', 'keep', 'this', 'as',

"TIFU by forgetting how my couches were moved into my apartment. Yada yada happened a year ago yada yada. This didn’t happen today but I don’t think it matters because there is still a lesson of stupidity to be learned. 

Sooo. Back story. I had bought a new set of couches that were set to be delivered on a Monday, so I had planned to borrow my works truck and trailer to move my old couches out over the weekend. Problem was I had forgotten that when we moved in the movers couldn’t fit the couches around the bend at the front door, so they had to bring them in through the sliding doors on the back porch.

Here in lies the first of a series of problems.. At the time the back porch was open. I had forgotten about this minor detail when they enclosed our porch with screened windows about a year prior. I measured the screens and there was no way the couches would fit through the screen openings. 

These older couches were still pretty nice and a used furniture store down the street had offered to buy them for $230. So at this point I didn’t want to get an axe and go to town on them or anything. 

So I called the apartment office and informed the woman who answered of the problem. She was kinda pissed because apparently they had sent out emails about this that I did not read. My fault. I apologized which didn’t help. She said she would call me back and when she did, she told me that I would be charged $200 for contractors to come out and disassemble the screens to remove the couches. 

Unfortunately the contractors couldn’t come until the following Wednesday and the new set was still scheduled to be delivered on Monday. Here I found out that rescheduling delivery within one business day meant a charge of $30. So I had broken even on the cost of my fuck up. I ended up saying screw it, borrowed an axe and saw and had a someone fun time destroying the old couches and taking them to the dump piece by piece. Problem resolved.

In comes the last fuck up in the series. I had not considered how the delivery company was going to get the new couches into the house. As they would not fit through the screens, as well. 

And this is how I shot myself in the foot, or more aptly feet, and was out $460.


TLDR: I forgot my couches were moved into my apt via the porch and when the complex enclosed the porches with screens had no way to get the old couches out, or new couches in, resulting in a

"TIFU Throwing away my friends ashes from their grandmother on Christmas It took me a lotttt of courage to want to post this.
A LOT

So, I went over to my friends house on Christmas Eve because we’ve had this tradition for ten years to go back and fourth celebrating Christmas at each others houses. Apparently he let his nephew rent a room out and he kicked him out two days ago because he kept messing up the house completely, and was very irresponsible overall.

I agreed to help clean the place up before his family and a few of our friends came over tomorrow. I mainly swept,vacuumed, and dusted ( and threw out some empty alchohol bottles + taking out some garbage )

The house looked nice, smelled clean, and we were both proud of ourselves for cleaning so damn good.
We ended up going to sleep not long after and woke up the next day around 6 AM to get prepared for everything.

While I was searching for some eggnog to set out for everyone to drink, I came across an empty bottle of vodka hidden behind some bottles in the fridge that seemed to be filled with something that looked like cigarette ash.
I obviously threw it away because in my mind, why would I keep an empty bottle of vodka filled with the remains of a cigarette?

Hours went by and people started arriving. We sat down, had a nice dinner, spoke about our favorite time about the holidays etc. My friend got up and went to his room telling us to wait there for a second and that he’d be right back.

Some of us were wondering what he was getting. Most of us thinking it was some secret Santa event or a gift and so on. We pretty much just continued our conversation until we heard him freaking out in another room. First, most of us looked around pretty shocked. I decided to get up and go check things out, telling everyone else at the dinner table to give me a minute.

I entered the room and I saw most of his objects on the ground and his bed sheets ripped off. I was really shocked and asked him what was wrong, he then replied telling me that his grandmothers ashes were gone.

He used to keep them in a vase but he recently put them in a necklace that he found out was owned by his grandma before she passed on. I started lookin  around with him until I remembered the vodka bottle.

That was just cigarette ash, right? No way that’d be anything but that? Why would they be in there? 

He told me he thought his nephew had stole it until I looked under his bed and found the necklace, empty of any ash.

I immediately started freaking out and told him what I threw away earlier and he ran out the room and into the kitchen, digging into the garbage cans and not caring what anyone at the table who were there thought. I came out as well and awkwardly started digging through the cans too. I could sense everyone was uncomfortable by the energy going through the house.

Luckily, he got the bottle.

Unluckily, the ashes had fallen out of it when it was thrown away.

In the end I went home because I felt terrible and I could tell my friend was very hurt inside.

I’m pretty sure his drunk nephew put the ashes in the bottle.


I messaged him yesterday and he has yet to respond so I feel like he hates me now.


TL;DR: went over on Christmas Eve, helped cleaned up after his irresponsible nephew was kicked out, found a vodka bottle filled with what I thought was cigarette ashes and threw it away. Friend found out ashes were missing, me and him dug through a garbage can in-front of people, I left out of guilt.",1,"['tifu', 'throwing', 'away', 'my', 'friends', 'ashes', 'from', 'their',

"TIFU by saving a mole from getting hit by a car Of course, this was a while ago during the summer.

I work overnights doing refrigeration work for Kroger’s and such. One night on my lunch I was sitting outside, and this mole came up to me and nibbled on my boot.

The mole then heard a car passing, and freaked out; running directly towards the car. For some reason I had to stop it. So I waved down the car and told him to stop. Without even thinking, I picked up the mole to carry it into the grass. Well, we got to the grass, then the mole bit me.

APPARENTLY moles have diseases, and my mother asked me to go to the doctor to get it checked out. 
I got to the ER, and waited for an hour. Once I went in to see the doctor, he looked at my finger and told me it was fine, and sent me away.

$300 later, I’m mole disease free.

TLDR: saved a moles life and it charged me $300 for helping.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'saving', 'mole', 'from', 'getting', 'hit', 'by', 'car', 'of', 'course', 'this', 'was', 'while', 'ago', 'during', 'the', 'summer', 'work', 'overnights', 'doing', 'refrigeration', 'work', 'for', 'kroger’s', 'and', 'such', 'one', 'night', 'on', 'my', 'lunch', 'was', 'sitting', 'outside', 'and', 'this', 'mole', 'came', 'up', 'to', 'me', 'and', 'nibbled', 'on', 'my', 'boot', 'the', 'mole', 'then', 'heard', 'car', 'passing', 'and', 'freaked', 'out', 'running', 'directly', 'towards', 'the', 'car', 'for', 'some', 'reason', 'had', 'to', 'stop', 'it', 'so', 'waved', 'down', 'the', 'car', 'and', 'told', 'him', 'to', 'stop', 'without', 'even', 'thinking', 'picked', 'up', 'the', 'mole', 'to', 'carry', 'it', 'into', 'the', 'grass', 'well', 'we', 'got', 'to', 'the', 'grass', 'then', 'the', 'mole', 'bit', 'me', 'apparently', 'moles', 'have', 'diseases', 'and', 'my', 'mother', 'asked', 'me', 'to', 'go', 'to', 'the', 'doctor', 'to', 'get', 'it', 'checked', 'out', 'got', 'to', 'the', 'er', 'and', 'waited', 'for', 'an', 'hour', 'once', 'went', 'in', 'to', 'see', 'the', 'doctor', 'he', 'looked', 'at', 'my', 'finger', 'and', 'told', 'me', 'it', 'was', 'fine', 'and', 'sent', 'me', 'away', '300', 'later', 'i’m', 'mole', 'disease', 'free', 'tldr', 'saved', 'moles', 'life', 'and', 'it', 'charged', 'me', '300', 'for', 'helping']",tifu by saving mole from getting hit by car of course this was while ago during the summer work overnights doing refrigeration work for kroger’s and such one night on my lunch was sitting outside and this mole came up to me and nibbled on my boot the mole then heard car passing and freaked out running directly towards the car for some reason had to stop it so waved down the car and told him to stop without even thinking picked up the mole to carry it into the grass well we got to the grass then the mole bit me apparently moles have diseases and my mother asked me to go to the doctor to get it checked out got to the er and waited for an hour once went in to see the doctor he looked at my finger and told me it was fine and sent me away 300 later i’m mole disease free tldr saved moles life and it charged me 300 for helping,tifu by saving mole from getting hit by car of course this wa while ago during the summer work overnights doing refrigeration work for kroger’s and such one night on my lunch wa sitting outside and this mole came up to me and nibbled on my boot the mole then heard car passing and freaked out running directly towards the car for some reason had to stop it so waved down the car and told him to stop without even thinking picked up the mole to carry it into the grass well we got to the grass then the mole bit me apparently mole have disease and my mother asked me to go to the doctor to get it checked out got to the er and waited for an hour once went in to see the doctor he looked at my finger and told me it wa fine and sent me away 300 later i’m mole disease free tldr saved mole life and it charged me 300 for helping,tifu by save mole from get hit by car of cours thi wa while ago dure the summer work overnight do refriger work for kroger’ and such one night on my lunch wa sit outsid and thi mole came up to me and nibbl on my boot the mole then heard car pass and freak out run directli toward the car for some reason had to stop it so wave down the car and told him to stop without even think pick up the mole to carri it into the grass well we got to the grass then the mole bit me appar mole have diseas and my mother ask me to go to the doctor to get it check out got to the er and wait for an hour onc went in to see the doctor he look at my finger and told me it wa fine and sent me away 300 later i’m mole diseas free tldr save mole life and it charg me 300 for help
"I ate dumpster pizza Last month I bought meal worms for my chickens $50+ for a bag that lasts a month, but they need extra protein to grow feathers and stay warm. We decided that’s too much as me and the wife combined with the pet chow we make hardly even spend $50 a month on our food (rice and beans for us and chicken quarters for the kids, extremely frugal.) anyways we’ve done this a few times in the past, dumpster dive at local restaurants for chicken feed, they love it, we save money and the dog hides all the pizza crust. Problem is this year we don’t have health insurance so we have opted not to eat outside food at all. We live in a rural area so our Covid numbers haven’t been all that bad until recently so we haven’t had any fast food since October. I kept teasing my wife and pretending I’m going to eat some dumpster pizza we got for the chickens (straight from a box, I’m not an animal!) anyways I caught her sneaking a bite from the dogs piece this morning and we shared a slice.

"TIFU By Rolling My Boss's Trailer Down a Hill So, this happened on Saturday. To start off, I should probably explain my job and give a little background. I work for a rich guy who lives about half an hour away from me. Basically, I do whatever he needs me to do on his property, whether that be mowing the lawn, bucking hay, fixing his arena for his horses, or doing landscaping (I don't mean landscaping like making gardens, I mean like smoothing out a hill or excavating a hill to make an extra parking spot for his wife).

Well, I went out to work on Saturday, thinking that I'd work for a few hours and go home when my foot started hurting (I choose my own hours and I have a stress fracture in my foot). Around 2pm, my foot started hurting, so I told his wife that I was going to head home because of it. She said that was fine. Right as I was about to leave, my boss ""asked"" me to stay and remove the dirt that had built up from him excavating the hillside that week without me there. I was like, fine, whatever, I'll move dirt for a few hours since it's 90% operating machinery. So I hook up his tractor to his triple axle dump trailer and start filling it with the excavator. Once the trailer is full, I hop into the tractor to drive the dirt down the hill to the dumping spot.

While I am backing up, I hear a thumping sound, which I thought was odd, but it may have just been some rocks or something. After I had backed up from the flat area to where the hill starts sloping down, I hear the thumping again. Once, twice, and then suddenly the trailer is rolling down the hill without the tractor that was supposed to be attached to it.

About 20 yards behind where it had started rolling were some rocks, and I mean ROCKS, they were probably 400lbs+ and 3-4 feet in diameter each. The trailer ends up with the right tires and back axle perched on some of these rocks.

I approach the trailer to assess the damage, to see that the wheels on the rear axle were no longer parallel to each other. The trailer was stuck so badly on these rocks that we had to use both his tractor and his excavator together to get the trailer unstuck. Turns out, when you're distracted by pain, you forget to do things. Things like close the latch on the trailer hitch so that it doesn't bounce off the ball on the tractor. It's the little things that'll get you, I guess. And yes, I do take full responsibility for this happening, it's my fault for not double checking the trailer before I started using it.

Luckily, there was no structural damage to the trailer, it was just the axle which had been bent from slamming into a bunch of rocks at probably 20mph and the rear door bar which had been bent by the force of stopping the dirt. It ended up only costing $700 and some to replace the axle and straighten the bar, unlike the 3-4 grand I had at first expected after seeing the crash.

"TIFU I asked about a controversial topic and humiliated myself  Tldr at the end

So to give some background. I don't take medication.

What's that you have a killer headache? Fight through till you sleep it off. What's that you have an abscess? Fight through it till you pop it and suck it clean or you sleep it off.

Well based on my good ol' I'd rather refuse medication and suffer technique.. My big brain decided to ask for advice on getting the corona vaccine.

I am by no way an anti vaxxer but the more I typed the more I read a meme where I was the anti vaxxer. I self humiliated myself into realisation that simple pills if you will are not the same as the vaccines I so willingly took in school to keep me safe from bigger threats.

I feel horrible, ashamed and humiliated.. I'll try to revert what I have done but I needed to confess my fuck up while it was fresh.

"TIFU by having morning wood So this was way back in them good ole high school days. I was actually in 1st period world geography. So I was dozing off, and ended up in full blown nap mode. 

So time goes by, I'm sleeping so damn good. And next thing I know I hear my name being called by my teacher (who obviously knows I'm sleeping) asking me to come to the front of the class and take the overhead projector to a different class room. 

At this point I realize I'm in quite the pickle. I notice my wood. And it's raging. Like seriously it had some blood flow to it.  The whole class is staring, so no swift positioning my stuff.  So with the class watching me, I awkwardly take off my hoodie (still seated), ball up my hoodie then set it in my lap, and walk to the front of the class holding my hoodie on my groin area acting as natural as possible. Emphasis on ""as possible"".  Grab the projector with one arm and held the hoodie with the other. It is pretty difficult to walk right with an ill positioned boner. Lost the wood pretty quick probably when I got into the hallway.

"My heart is on the verge of failure and I haven't told anyone I'll start by mentioning that I've had cancer treatment a total of three times throughout my life, this latest instance was about a year ago and it is looking like I'm cancer free.

Unfortunately all the treatment has slowly left my heart in worse shape and I'm facing cardiomyopathy as a result.

I've known that it was in bad shape for a few years but this last instance of arrhythmia was very bad, and it prompted me to visit the doctor who had ultimately diagnosed me with what I've already known.

I am able to do most normal things and walk regularly with medication, although I sometimes have to stop and take a breather since I'm wearing a face mask for obvious reasons. I've also struggled with working out which is the biggest disappointment as I used to work out fairly regularly.

At this point, nobody knows, not any of my family or friends. I'm a single male, approaching my late thirties and have no dependents. I've given up finding someone to spend whatever I have left in my life though it's somewhat difficult anyway with all things considered.

I'm not really sad about it either, at least not yet, and I really don't want anyone's sympathy over it. This is why I haven't told anyone.

I'm conflicted between letting my closest family and friends know  now or just waiting until things get worse. Thankfully I could live as long as I possibly could by staying healthy and keep taking medication, but my heart may go out at any time. Either way I'm not sure how to break the news.

"TIFU by drunkenly getting lost in a new country with only a backpack full of stolen broken glass. Much like many stories here, this didn't happen today, but about 6 years ago.

In college when I studied abroad, after the second day of exploring our new neighborhood, my classmates and I decided to stop by a pub to well, get sloshed. There were probably a couple dozen of us together that filtered in and out of the pub, and since it was already a popular place, it was hard for us to pack in at once but we finally made it. It was a really cool Irish pub (not in Ireland) with normal high tops, booths, a bar, and an upper deck area that looked down onto the main seating area.

A few of us claimed a high table before downing several rounds of Irish Car Bombs (sorry) along with shots and of course a few pints. After we were all a bit tipsy, my klepto friends and I in all our glorious drunkenness, apparently decided that the Guinness glasses they used were really, really cool, and it would be a good idea to take some for souvenirs. They had to be ours. We were nervous about getting caught by the staff nearby, so we had to come up with a plan to not get caught taking any.

So this glassware heist was a classic four-man job. Two lookouts on the sides blocked the camera and a barkeep's lines of sight. I, the mastermind and wheelman, would reach under the table to hold open my backpack (cut me some slack, I was basically a tourist) and the 4th was our burglar, who would set an empty glass in the bottom when the coast was clear.

We repeated this process until there were, I don't know, maybe 7 or 8 glasses in my bag. The only problem was, to keep getting glasses we had to keep ordering beers to drink, not to mention we only took maybe one glass of every 4 so we wouldn't have an empty table. So obviously we were even farther gone by this point. The person who was taking the glasses had to go de-beer, so another friend of ours sat down in her seat. We explained the plan to him, and he somehow convinced us that he in fact was *not* too drunk to help us. Very comforting. But when all of us were ready, I opened the bag and he held a glass above it. Then suddenly... *SMASH*. He just dropped the fucking glass instead of gently nesting it into another one. So here I am, drunk, surrounded by a bunch of other drunks, with a backpack full of broken glass. Obviously I couldn't just dump it all out, so I decided I had to get out of there. I paid my tab, snuck out, and started walking home.

Then I realized I had no idea where I was. No idea where ""home"" was. No map, no cell phone with service, no idea what my address was. It was my second day in this country, and I didn't even know the language! Even if I could have talked to a local, I wouldn't know what to ask them. I wandered around for what felt like an eternity, but finally found a street that looked familiar, and followed it until I found my building, by some miracle. I stumbled inside, dropped my backpack, and passed out.

When I came to the next morning, memories of the night came flooding back. I checked my backpack and, as karma would have it, it was completely soaked with the smell of stale beer and full of shards of broken glass. To add insult to injury, I found some paperwork that could have guided me home, and that too was soaked.

I felt really guilty about it all, so I somehow mustered up the courage to return to the bar and gave them some money to cover the glasses and a bit more on top. They thought it was sort of funny and appreciated me covering the damages, even though I'm sure they were more angry than they let on and judgemental about me, a stupid tourist, pulling that shit.

We all ended up going back there regularly, but they either never seemed to recognize me after that, or maybe just didn't care.

drunkenly getting lost in new country with only backpack full of stolen broken glass much like many stories here this didn't happen today but about years ago in college when studied abroad after the second day of exploring our new neighborhood my classmates and decided to stop by pub to well get sloshed there were probably couple dozen of us together that filtered in and out of the pub and since it was already popular place it was hard for us to pack in at once but we finally made it it was really cool irish pub not in ireland with normal high tops booths bar and an upper deck area that looked down onto the main seating area few of us claimed high table before downing several rounds of irish car bombs sorry along with shots and of course few pints after we were all bit tipsy my klepto friends and in all our glorious drunkenness apparently decided that the guinness glasses they used were really really cool and it would be good idea to take some for souvenirs they had to be ours we were nervous about getting caught by the staff nearby so we had to come up with plan to not get caught taking any so this glassware heist was classic four man job two lookouts on the sides blocked the camera and barkeep's lines of sight the mastermind and wheelman would reach under the table to hold open my backpack cut me some slack was basically tourist and the 4th was our burglar who would set an empty glass in the bottom when the coast was clear we repeated this process until there were don't know maybe or glasses in my bag the only problem was to keep getting glasses we had to keep ordering beers to drink not to mention we only took maybe one glass of every so we wouldn't have an empty table so obviously we were even farther gone by this point the person who was taking the glasses had to go de beer so another friend of ours sat down in her seat we explained the plan to him and he somehow convinced us that he in fact was not too drunk to help us very comforting but when all of us were ready opened the bag and he held glass above it then suddenly smash he just dropped the fucking glass instead of gently nesting it into another one so here am drunk surrounded by bunch of other drunks with backpack full of broken glass obviously couldn't just dump it all out so decided had to get out of there paid my tab snuck out and started walking home then realized had no idea

stale beer and full of shards of broken glass to add insult to injury found some paperwork that could have guided me home and that too was soaked felt really guilty about it all so somehow mustered up the courage to return to the bar and gave them some money to cover the glasses and bit more on top they thought it was sort of funny and appreciated me covering the damages even though i'm sure they

"Im 16 years old and secretly like taking to people a lot older me. 
I’m 16 and i like to meet people online because this quarantine has been pretty lonely and has me feeling like I have no one to talk to. So I go on Reddit and meet/talk to some people. 

Some people are teenagers and others are a lot older than me like 10-15 years older than me. Most people would consider this creepy but I personally don’t mind it. I honestly kind of like it because I feel like older people,(adults) can hold a better conversation. Teens can keep a good conversation too, but I guess it’s just different with adults because they have more life experience.

Most of the conversations I had with adults have been really good, and the conversation rarely gets dry which is a great thing for someone like me, who is introverted. It’s weird because all my friends in real life are my age 15-16. Is this considered bad or anything? I never saw anything wrong with it probably because I grew up with 4 brothers and they are a lot older than me,(12 year age gaps)

"TIFU by losing a job over a reddit post I got a call yesterday morning informing from the employer I signed a work contract with informing me that my reddit account had been linked with a post about falsifying information on my resume. I am not even sure how the employer I signed a work contract with even found my reddit as it isn't linked to any personal email, my name, or other social media usernames. But the post they linked me to was a COMMENT I made on a post in r/illegallifeprotips where a user suggested people lie and fake documents on their resume to get a job. My comment was essentially saying that was a terrible idea and I would just really sell myself on the duties I have done in the resume rather than lie and fake documents. I tried explaining how I did not make the post but rather a comment on the post basically telling people not to obey the post. This wasn't acceptable to them apparently, the recruiter and his manager I went through to get the job even went as far as to tell my ""future employer"" that the post was nothing to worry about. I guess they didn't accept that answer because I got a call later saying my offer of employment had been rescinded for ""embellishments on my resume"" but when asking for specific examples of embellishments I on what the embellishments were they wouldn't ever give me any and just said ""I have embellishments on my resume"". They had encouraged me to put in a 2 weeks notice so I could start with them early as well so now I have already quit my current job but lost the job I was going to over a reddit post that i didn't even make.. This position would have been a $20k a year pay raise from my current job and I lost it over some stupid confusion and my reddit account being linked to the title of a post I commented on basically. I had already signed all sorts of work agreements with them and had a start date...

TLDR: My future employer found my reddit account somehow, linked a comment I made to the title of the post, decided they didn't like the title of the post or the sub it was in, explained it my comment and not my post, rescinded my offer for ""embellishments"" and never told me what those embellishments were.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'losing', 'job', 'over', 'reddit', 'post', 'got', 'call', 'yesterday',

"TIFU By Telling my Dad I went off the pill 
TLDR; Dad found out I went off the pill. Forgot the reason I was on it in the first place and proceeded to make me a power point presentation about family planning and It’s just super awkward. Can’t trust Mom. Husband is laughing at my pain

Obligatory this happened a few days ago.
So recently I had to go off the pill. I was only on it due to a hormonal condition and not actually because I was trying to control any births.
As of right now I live in the states with my husband and I’m sure anyone reading this would know how expensive prescriptions in this bountiful country can be. My body has only ever agreed with one brand of birth control which unfortunately is not covered by my insurance here and I’m told it’s illegal to send prescriptions through the mail so here we are. About 4 generic versions of the pill later and a whole bunch of depressing body changes, I decided it was time to just come off the pill and my doctor gave me the okay but warned me there would still be side effects.
So I let my mom know mainly because she’s a nurse but also because I’m not shy to share personal things with my mom, especially about health. I specifically asked her not to mention all of this birth control talk to my Dad because my Dad and I are pretty much best friends and I figured it would just be an awkward conversation plus why would we ever need to discuss my lady issues anyways right? 
Unbeknownst to me, my mom somehow brought up my issues to my Dad in what she says was just a “casual conversation”. As I write this I’m realizing maybe the fuck up was telling my mom in the first place lol 

So I get a call from my Dad that started off like this: 

Dad: Hey is everything okay? Your mom told me you’ve been having some issues lately 

Me: Issues? No I’m okay Dad. 

Dad: Well she told me about your birth control. You know you don’t need any of that 

Me: Oh well I did Dad. Remember a few years ago when we went to the doctor for my hormone issues? 

Dad: Oh I think I recall but very vaguely. But anyways I wanted to tell you there’s no need for all of that. You just need proper family planning. Those pills have so many side effects 

Me: Well we’re not planning on having kids yet Dad 

Dad: But with this PLAN that I have you’d never have to worry about becoming pregnant unexpectedly 

Me: *little confused, kinda irritated because I thought I explained why I was on the pill in the first place* 

Dad I wasn’t on it because I was trying to actually control a birth from happening. I can handle that 

Dad: I see. Okay well please check your email. I just sent you something 

*checks email while on the phone with him* 

My Dad sent me a whole ass powerpoint presentation that he put together himself, for ME, about Family planning. It was loaded. Had a whole calendar in there and everything. What happens when a birth is unplanned. Everything about ovulation. The slides were even animated. My husband was listening as we briefly went over said powerpoint and could barely hold his laughter in. It was like this awkward sex ed class but from a concerned/caring parent. I wanted to crawl up into a ball and disintegrate but I told him I appreciate the concern and the effort? 
I know My Dad has my best intentions at heart always and he knows Kids are not in the plan yet so this was his way of giving me advice. 
But we’re basically talking about my sex life here, with my Dad, by way of a powerpoint.  Cringe. 

Archived the power point though because it was super informative and I also applaud my Dad for trying to find the best way for him to give me advice despite the awkwardness/me wanting to disappear into a black hole. Husband laughed so hard when we hung up that I saw tears

EDIT: Okay WOAHHHHH! This blew up. Wtf! Thank you kind strangers for the awards. I am not worthy!!!

So a couple things: 

1. I see a consensus for wanting a copy of this powerpoint and as much I’d love to share it with you all, it does have a couple baby pictures of my Dad and I when he was all happy I was born LOL BUT ALSO my Dad is on reddit and if by some twist of fate he reads this, I wouldn’t want him to see his personal powerpoint just pop up places without his consent. 

2. I appreciate all the love for my Dad and he would truly appreciate it as well. Being a parent to me was not the easiest job but he’s been my best friend no matter what. He’s going to be an amazing grandpa. 

3. Dad, if you happen to read this, I appreciate you and I love you and I’m thankful for everything you do for me including the awkward PowerPoints ❤️

Edit 2: 

1. My mom isn’t a narc. Lol. I don’t mind that she shared the info because I know it came from a place of love and concern 

2. I see a few comments of having prescriptions mailed to me, yes they would be coming from a different country and I guess it is possible? But either way I’m okay with giving my body a little rest

3. We are a mixed race and religion family and my parents beliefs have never been forced on me or on each other ☺️",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'telling', 'my', 'dad', 'went', 'off', 'the', 'pill', 'tldr', 'dad',

"TIFU By cleaning out my ears with only cotton swabs for 20 years. This actually unfolded over the last week, and am still ""enjoying"" the results of my actions..

So for the last few years I've regularly had an itch in my ears. Over the past few months it came as far as having an almost daily itch and I had to clean my ears multiple times a week because of the ginormous amount of ear wax my ears were producing. 

I had been searching for a long time to find an alternative for cotton swabs as I am aware they're not the best but wasn't able to find any (guess I'm an idiot..)

Last week the itching became so bad I started googling again knowing doctors will not be an option for at least 6 more months in my country due to COVID. And so I found an ear spray that is supposed to help dissolve your ear wax while keeping your ears moisturized. Sounds perfect!

I ordered the spray and as soon as it arrived I started going to town. At first the itch immediately subsided. Then.. It became much - and I mean much! worse. Also, any time I'd move my jaw I'd hear a scratchy noise inside my ear...

Finally fed up I took out a cotton swab and was shocked as I pulled out a huge piece of dead skin from my ear. As in.. I didn't even know the inner ear had that much skin surface.. it's like I'm a badly shedding lizard in my ear. Every day I'm pulling out huge pieces of dead skin from my ears and it doesn't seem to stop anytime soon..

So yeah.. gonna enjoy that for a while.. At least my hearing has improved since using the spray.. No more cotton swabs for me..

Tl;dr: Used cotton swabs for years, itchy ears caused me to try out a spray against ear wax. Turns out my ears were itchy from years and years of dead skin buildup. Now my ears are even more itchy from all the dead skin getting unstuck in my ears.

Edit. To all the people asking me in the comments for the product. Check your local pharmacy, they probably have similar products there and will be able to inform you. Best of luck and healthy ear cleaning to y'all!",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'cleaning', 'out', 'my', 'ears', 'with', 'only', 'cotton', 'swabs', 'for', '20', 'years', 'this', 'actually', 'unfolded', 'over',

"TIFU accidentally telling an old woman she was going to die This happened a few years back now but I haven’t forgotten about it since.

I used to work in a bingo hall in the UK which, for the uninitiated, is a large entertainment establishment where anyone of legal age (18+) can risk their well earned cash to have a chance to hit the jackpot in a few games of 90 ball bingo. It is a well known leisure activity that attracts a generally older customer base.

The longer you work there, the more you see a few repeat customers which you will eventually learn the names of to have a conversation and a bit of banter with. The standard entertainment based customer service.

During that fateful day a lovely older woman had won during the bingo and was claiming her winnings with me in the Booksales area. 

As I was cashing out her winnings for her she slipped into our chat that her adult son had unfortunately and suddenly passed away a few weeks prior and this was the first bit of luck she felt she had had since and that she couldn’t believe he wasn’t there with her. I had known her for a few years prior to this as she was quite a regular and after my initial, “I am really sorry to hear that” I wanted to add something that might’ve given her a bit of comfort by showing a bit of empathy.

My first thought was to suggest that I believed that no matter how long had passed that we all see each other again in some sort of way, to keep as positive as possible and that I am thinking about her at this time. 
My brain wasn’t as eloquent however and as I handed her the winnings over I said, “Don’t worry, you’ll see him again soon” as she walked away.

As she returned to the main hall my brain had finally caught up to the horror show my mouth had just thrown out. My colleagues who had overheard were roaring with laughter.

I grabbed a box of chocolates from the store cupboard and ran into the hall frantically searching for an old woman with white hair and a cardigan in a sea of old women with white hair and cardigans until I eventually found her. I apologised profusely and explained what I had really meant to say and how I was mortified. Thankfully she saw the funny side to it and accepted my chocolate based apology.

I now always try to think before speaking... I doubt it has worked.

TL;DR: I accidentally told an old woman upon the hearing the news that her son had recently passed away that she would die soon and see him again.",1,"['tifu', 'accidentally', 'telling', 'an', 'old',

"I am an inwardly angry, violent person To preface, on the outside most people know and would describe me as calm, laid back and patient. I don’t blow up very often. I treat people with respect. Even when people treat me like shit, I push back calmly and confidently, but I don’t often cuss people out or become physically violent. 

With that said, my biggest trigger is disrespect. Being disrespected instantly triggers extremely violent internal dialogue and impulses. For example: I had a landlord question my integrity for a mistake he made and tried to blame on me. I couldn’t tell you how the rest of the conversation went because while I stared sternly and blankly at him, all I could hear in my head was my voice asking me how difficult i thought it would be to shattered his jaw and break his ribs. I work hard to be respectful and to gain people’s respect and confidence in me. So having my integrity questioned when I did nothing wrong sent me somewhere dark. In the end I just calmly told him to get fucked and moved out. Another example is when I got cut off on the freeway (I drive a minivan because I have kids and I drive in the middle or slow lane so people can get around my slow 70-75 mph driving). I didn’t flip the driver off, I didn’t honk my horn, I just threw my hands up in a “what’s that about?” manner. The driver followed me to a parking lot and got out to start yelling at me. I spaced out and all I could focus on was this guy and what I would need to do to stove his face in/produce my firearm if necessary. In the end I calmly told him to gtfo and that is was calling the cops as I locked the doors and rolled up the windows because my kids were in the car. 

This is a regular thing. I’m a pretty well versed as a fighter. I grew up in a rough neighborhood and had to defend myself a lot. I am prior military and I know how to defend myself and my family. I’ve been in various martial arts for years. So I’m confident in my physical ability and my capacity to do effective violence. So I don’t think I’m compensating for a perceived weakness or insecurity in that regard. I just can’t tolerate disrespect without going to really dark place. I’ve had the urge to seriously injury or maim people at times, and although I’ve never acted on it, that propensity to instantly develop that internal dialogue kind of scares me. I’m proud of my capacity for restraint and self-control, but I don’t like the internal dialogue I tend to resort to.

I see a therapist and discuss these things with him, but it still bothers me.",0,"['am', 'an', 'inwardly', 'angry', 'violent', 'person', 'to', 'preface', 'on', 'the', 'outside', 'most', 'people',

"TIFU by asking my husband about Pokemon Okay, so this happened a few days ago, of course. My husband and I were in bed at night, and I was feeling pretty horny, so I definitely wanted to have sex. We were cuddling and talking and stuff, and in an attempt at being sexy, I asked him how his pokemon campaign was going. 

So a bit of background, he's currently playing Heartgold doing the Nuzlocke challenge. It's when you play through the game but when your pokemon die, they're actually dead. Or something like that? He's been talking to me about it nonstop.

Okay, so back to the story, I was trying to be sexy by asking him how his Nuzlocke challenge was going because I thought he'd think ""ooh, she cares about my Pokemon endeavors, that's so sexy."" 

Anyway, he answered my question... For a long time... We did not have sex that night.

"TIFU by getting a $70 parking ticket This story happened to me in February, and since I recently got Reddit I thought I would post about it. I'm a university student, who like many, am very broke. Because of this, I refuse to pay into the scam that is campus parking (it's $1220 for 8 months). They force us to purchase a $350 bus pass as well, therefore, it doesn't make sense for me to pay for a parking pass when I'm forced to pay for the bus. Anyways, onto the story. This one particular Thursday I had a night class and was planning to drive two hours afterwards to visit my boyfriend. I didn't want to pack up the car, take the bus to class, take the bus home, and then drive to see him (I'm also a little sketched out taking the bus at night alone). So I thought what the heck, I'll just risk parking on campus for four hours (this was my first time risking it). I figured that if I got a ticket I would pay the $20 and be on my way. So I drive to campus, park, and walk to get some food before my class starts. I come back to check my car before class and turns out I have a ticket. At a closer look, I realize that the ticket was $70 (another campus scam, in my opinion, the spots are never filled anyways). As I realise fuck up I start freaking out about the price. In the midst of this minor freak out, I ended up locking my keys in the car. Well great, now I'm going to miss class and there was no point in parking on campus in the first place. So I call CAA and they say they will be there in one hour. Two hours go by and I get a call, the CAA guy is lost on campus. About 30 minutes later he finds his way to me. He informs me that because of my older car it is going to be difficult for him to unlock it. So that took about 25 minutes. At this point, I have missed my class and decide to drive up to my boyfriend. On the way there, a raccoon ran out in front of my car on the highway so quickly that I did not have time to get out of the way. I hit it and it cracked the front of my car. I started crying, I felt so terrible. I thought to myself that this day could not get any worse, I was wrong. I got to my boyfriend's and we had to do some car switching so his roommate could go to work in the morning. I offered to back my boyfriend's car out of the driveway. He lives on a busy road so I was so concerned with the traffic that I totally did not see the huge traffic cone at the end of the driveway (not the little triangle ones, the huge striped cylinder looking ones). I heard a crunch and didn't know what to do.  In my fast thinking I decided to continue to roll over it (I later learned that that was a bad idea).  Luckily I didn't total his car I just broke the mudflap. His roommate witnessed the whole thing and now everyone makes fun of me for it. Needless to say, I had a lot of fuck ups that day.

TL;DR - I risked it, parked on campus, got a $70 ticket, locked my keys in the car, hit a raccoon, and drove over a massive traffic cone with my boyfriend's car, all in one day.",1,"['tifu', 'by',

"I'm giving ""control"" back instead of trying to take it I spent last night thinking alot inside my own head about what I may possibly have been doing wrong for most of my life. And I think me trying to control too much around me all the time has made me tired and weary. I wake up tired and feel blah. I don't get excited much about how to tackle my days because I feel like nobody listens to me anyways. I get ignored. Laughed at. All that good shit. (I'm a mom) Alot of the time I am left feeling like nothing I do really matters. Well I guess that doesn't really matter anymore now. I'm throwing control back at everyone else! I will let my kids be responsible for themselves more and my ol' man will be making more decisions. Because my brain is like mush after 10 years! Lmao And I'm tired of being angry all the time and just worrying about stuff by myself. Let them do some too. Let them do. Let is a very important word here! I hope it will be therapeutic for me to stop being a bitch about things. I'm ready to enjoy my mid 30's as a mom and wife and don't want to be like that any more.

"TIFU by letting my mom discover my c*m sock Obligatory this happened 3 days ago. When I beat my meat, I like to use a sock because it is the least messy way to enjoy myself. Because I don't want  to have the smell spreading through my belongings, I prefer to leave it in an open (but kinda hidden) place, mostly under my bed. My parents never enter my room for any reason other to say dinner is ready or stuff like that, so there hasn't been a problem so far.

 A few days ago I had to go run some errands that would take a pretty long while, meaning I wouldn't be home for at least a couple of hours. Take in mind that said sock was under my bed at the moment, because I never expected someone to actually look beneath my bed. After I completed the tasks I was given, I enter my house to find my dad mopping the floor, which was odd to me, because we always vacuum the whole house before mopping. I enter without giving it much thought and go to my mom's bedroom to tell her I've done what she told me, and she said she vacuumed my room while I was absent and my dad was going to mop it later. I freeze thinking about the surprise under my bed and just say thanks and run to look if it's still there. It is, but it was in another spot . My mom is very meticulous when cleaning so I'm 99% sure she found it and just put it back to where she thought it was and never said anything to me in embarrassment.

"TIFU by having a naked brawl in my dorm room and permanently scarring my history teacher. This happened about 2 years ago. For context I live in a high school dorm of all guys, and naturally we hang out a ton in each other’s rooms. That year my room was the central hang out zone and often I would let my friends chill out there when I had to leave real quick. One day I was in there with 2 friends and I had to go shower (I changed by putting the towel over me first and then unclothing) and I let my friends stay in my room while I was gone. Upon my return I kicked them both out cause it’s a lot more awkward getting changed from a towel to clothes, and I also wanted some alone time. Maybe I’m weird but when I’m alone in my room I like to just chill naked, idk it’s just more comfortable. 

Anyway this is the juicy part, so I’m kicked back in my recliner, butt naked and watching YouTube, when all of a sudden a hand emerges from my closet with a phone that’s recording. Following the hand and grinning mischievously is one of my dumbshit friends (not one of the two who were in there previously, apparently this guy had been hiding in my closet for over an hour playing brawl stars and waiting for the perfect moment to strike). Naturally I start freaking the fuck out and jump up from my recliner, using my laptop to cover my crotch as it was the only thing in close proximity to me. This whole time I’m screaming every profanity in my vocabulary at this dude to get tf out, but he won’t listen and keeps recording. I attempt to grab a pair of underwear, but I’m only able to swap them out with the laptop to cover my crotch, and don’t actually get the chance to put them on. I then grab this guy’s phone with one hand and attempt to wrestle it away, while elbowing him and covering my crotch with my underwear with the other hand. Naturally we’re making a lot of noise and I’m still screaming at him, and the two friends that I had just kicked out overhead from the hallway and are banging on the door wondering what kind of demon magically spawned in my room that caused me to make such a racket. Then to make matters worse the house advisor on the floor, a middle-aged female history teacher, hears the racket and decides to get involved, using her master key to unlock my door. Upon opening it she is graced with the sight of my naked body, only obstructed by a pair of underpants that I’m loosely holding over my crotch, in a full out wrestling match with this other dude, screaming my ass off. She screams so loud that the entire dorm heard her, and slams the door immediately. To make matters worse her seven year old son decided to come with her while she was on dorm duty, but thank god he was standing somewhat behind her and was shielded from the worst of it. After this my friend had a big OH SHIT moment and he got into some pretty serious trouble. But he was still my friend and so i didn’t mention the recording phone to the house advisor, cause that had grounds for some serious cp allegations and no one needed that, he ended up deleting the video anyway. But to top it all off this house advisor became my history teacher the next year, and I don’t think either of us ever fully recovered from the awkwardness. 

TL;DR Didn’t check my closet before being naked, ended up having to have a nude wrestling match with a dude that came out of it, house advisor saw it all and later had her as my history teacher.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'having', 'naked', 'brawl', 'in', 'my', 'dorm', 'room', 'and', 'permanently', 'scarring', 'my', 'history', 'teacher', 'this', 'happened', 'about', 'years', 'ago', 'for',

"Tifu by being single too long This tifu takes place during the span of two years. 

To start off, I live in a very small town, like below 1k population and there's not a lot of singles women my around my age, so ""adult video sites"" was a frequent visit. 

But as luck would have it, a certain lady from a couple of years ago was up for a fun visit again, we'd tried before now and again but life got in the way every time.

So I get myself to her place for a whole day's visit, no car so it's busses and trains for me.
Without getting too graphic and sounding like a douchebag, we did this, this and that, she comes, we snuggle and take a nap.

Back up and at it, do that, that, and this, she comes. Now what's going through my mind is basically *the fuck can't I cum?* 
As with the aforementioned trains and busses, there's a schedule we gotta keep. She too realizes I haven't cum yet so she sets off the rectify the matter, and again without getting too graphic, she Goes. To. Town on it. 
And I'm sitting there looking at her, she's looking all sexy at me, and I still can't fucking cum and feeling like an absolute a-hole and finally  sort of awkwardly have to take matters into my own hands.  
So during my prolonged extreme singleness I have basically daily death gripped my lil buddy to the point its ""un-be-comming"" and will now have to try to live the monk life to rectify this. 

We both go *this was great, let's do it again sooner* and I start my way home, writing this shit.

"TIFU by measuring my wheelie bin. So today I (14M) was in my online science class and the teacher gave us a task to measure household objects. One of those objects was a wheelie bin so I decided to go out and do that experiment. So as you do when your about to measure your wheelie bin i wheeled it to a discreet location in between my dads car and the wall where I then got to it using my ruler(couldn’t be bothered to find a tape measure) to measure the size in cm of my wheelie bin. So I am just about finished with this incredibly valuable experiment that I am working on and I turn around to see the girl from next door (who has only just moved in and I have never met before) who had just got back from her run was giving me the weirdest...fucking... stare I have ever experienced that was clearly just screaming “WHAT IN ALL THATS HOLY IS THAT LAD DOING”. Now me being socially awkward just locked eyes with her frantically trying to think what to do next. Now a normal person in this situation would laugh it off and explain” haha yeah I’ve got to do this for a science experiment” and everyone would laugh and go on their merry way. Right? However this is me we’re talking about. So I decided just to look at the floor and practically run back into my house when the girl was still watching me probably wondering what the hell was wrong with me from a distance. No explanation. I didn’t even say hi and act like I was doing something perfectly normal. No. I just fucking ran like a constipated penguin back to my front door. I can only imagine what she thought I was doing and I feel like the biggest imbecile to walk this earth right now. She probably is now telling all her friends that she has a wheelie bin measuring weirdo for a next door neighbour. I don’t think I’ve cringed so hard in my life.

"TIFU by making a Black man think I was racist and afraid of him robbing me This happened pre-covid, but thought I'd share. Sorry if the format is weird, I'm on mobile.

A little back story here, im (22F) extremely forgetful. So every time I was out and about, I'd store the trash id accumulate throughout the day in my winter jacket pockets and forget about it leading to 2 pocketfuls of straw wrappers, receipts, candy wrappers, etc.

One cold winter night, I was taking the bus home. The bus was mostly empty, but a young Black man was sitting across from me. I didn't think much of him, just another person on the bus. As we waited for the bus to leave, I figured the best way to pass the time is to listen to music. This is a habit of mine, every time I'm on transportation, bus, train, etc I always take my wired headphones out and listen to music to pass the time. But during the winter months, when I wear that winter jacket with pockets full of trash, I start another bad habit. Looking at people to make sure they don't see all the trash falling out of my pockets as I try to untangle my wired head phones from the straw wrappers, candy wrappers, etc. It was mostly the social anxiety, what would they think of me if they saw all of this trash in my pockets? They'd take me for a slob. 

On this particular night though, it didn't cross my mind how it looked. A young white looking woman (spaniard) looking to and fro from a Black man with her on a mostly empty bus late at night? No, this did not cross my mind, all I could think about was the trash wrapped in my headphones and making sure he didn't think of me as this disgusting pig. 

He almost immediately noticed, leaned over to me and said ""im not gonna rob you"" for a second I was confused, but then it clicked in my head and I felt like the biggest jackass in history. I sheepisly apologized and told him the real reason, then wipped out some of the trash in my pockets. I still feel like an AH

"TIFU by selling my car I now need This just happened today and we’re still in a little disappointment. Two years ago my aunts husband (no relation but out of respect we call her aunt) passed away and she had no one. She has no kids, her nieces and nephews don’t talk to her and her step kids literally tricked her into thinking that she owns nothing of her late husbands belonging and took all of their dads belongings. They tried to take more but she stopped talking to them.

My wife and I helped her out a lot, mowing the grass, maintenance around the house, take her to sell at the flea market, dr, etc... without ever asking for payment of any kind. One day she comes up me as I was cutting grass and asked if I want her late husbands truck. 2011 Chevy diesel with 32k miles. I was hesitant and shocked but obliged and said yes. 

She gives me the title and bill of sale and got everything transferred. I have a car that I don’t use anymore so I decided to sell it today. Well, she calls and says she needs the car and boat back. W...T...F... I explained I just sold my car and I’d be carless. She said her step kids want to take her places etc and need the truck and she didn’t want to be stuck in the middle.

My wife and I were in total disappointment because we never saw her doing something like this. She just said that she needs the car back by summer so I’m actually going to give it back this weekend along with the title. 

Now I’ll be carless until I can find something.

"TIFU by going to work So I(f17) am in and out of sleep every night, no idea why. I do take melatonin gummies, have been for a couple weeks. I can sleep for 4 hours, sometimes, and the rest of the night I wake up all the time and cant sleep. That's the first problem.

Then I get up out of bed for work at 5:50, really been up since 4ish starting at the ceiling. 

Roads in town are slick as hell an I live in the country so dirt roads suck even more.

So I head to work and I get there at 6:23, usual time I get there. I realize I dont have my key card to clock in. 

Around 7:30ish i think, I am cutting up meat for the kielbasa for lunch. I split my left ring finger open through my glove and I was bleeding, I saved the meat from the blood. I called my coworker over because I needed a bandaid. 

I'm wierd here. I am a hunter. I can do blood, guts, bones, you name it, from animals and humans. I cannot do my own blood, I knew that already. There wasnt a whole lot of blood coming from my finger, but enough to be gushing out. 

So I am doubled over the trashcan next to the sink in the kitchen, I am the cook in an assisted living, while my coworker wraps my finger up. I'm dizzy as f*ck and trying to not pass out or throw up. I couldnt hear shit, everything was so monotoned and low sounding, I could hear clearly, but it was super low if that makes any sense. 

After 10 minutes of that and me finally getting water down, I'm able to stand up straight. Awesome. I still had to serve breakfast to everyone lol. 

Later, I'm about half way done making lunch when we run out of our clear gloves. All we have left are latex gloves. A couple weeks ago, I figured out I'm allergic to latex when i have hives breaking out so bad i cant move my fingers. Awesome. I'm also sweating enough that the bandaid wants to slide of my finger. 

So i get home around 2:15 and i look for my card. Cant find it anywhere. Not inbetween the seats, under them, in my glovebox, nothing. I'm looking for a solid 15 minutes before I fin that my card is stuck between the back and bottom part of the seat. 

When I found my card, my pants ripped at the thigh. Awesome that is the second pair of work pants to do that to me this week. It's a good thing I just bought 2 new pairs for work. I guess my pants cant take my thick? thighs.

I also purposely ditched my car on my way to work three days ago so I would avoid hitting the car in front of me. 

I am at home currently eating a bag of popcorn listen to hair bands from the 80's at 3pm. Greatest music ever. 

I'm now tired and want to sleep. 

How have yalls been?

"TIFU by leaving my window open all day for several days. It’s Summer here in Australia, and it has been raining quite a bit. It hasn’t been overly hot and I’ve been enjoying the cool breeze through the window. Due to covid I’ve been spending a lot of time holed up in my room playing video games. 

Today I was happily watching TV and playing Pokèmon. I could hear my parents TV from the living room, so I decided to put my noise cancelling earphones in to block out a layer of noise. I grab them off my bed head and A THOUSAND FUCKING ANTS crawl out and all over my hands. 

Now, I’m a girl, and believe me I can scream. I *screamed* like I was being murdered which caused my dogs to start barking, and my mum rushed in, looking worried. She helped brush them all off onto my bed, and after some tidying and searching, we realised they were coming in through the window, probably because of the rain (worms have also infested our verandah due to all the rain).

"TIFU by trusting an untrusty toot. There I(31F) was, sitting in the Arby's drive thru, when all of a sudden I felt like I had to toot. Nothing crazy, just a little tiny toot that would go completely unnoticed seeing how I was alone in a car. Also, it's not like I've been sick so what's the worst that could happen. Well, I found out real quick what the worst could be. I had just got done ordering so I go to roll up my window and as soon as it closes I let out my little toot. In a split second that tiny toot turned into liquid warmth and I'm just like, ""oh shit!"" I look around in the back seat for anything to help me out while also rolling my two front windows halfway down because holy god, that smell. I finally find an extra Aldi's bag to put under me so I don't end up getting poo on the heated leather seats, and I notice the people in the car in front of me looking back at me like, ""what the..."" Mind you, it's about 25 degrees Fahrenheit, so I look like a crazy woman rolling up to the window with my winter coat and hat on, and my windows half down. Then, when I get home I have to explain to my 11 year old how I need his help bringing food in because I've shit myself and have to clean up before handling food. He then tells my husband what's going on as I'm booking it up stairs to the bathroom. When I finally came back down, it was 100% the walk of shame. My husband, 11 year old, and 4 year old were waiting for me at the bottom and as soon as I make eye contact with them, my 4 year old just started busting up laughing and saying, ""Mommy pooped her pants! Mommy pooped her pants!"" And then the rest of us started busting up because who's not going to laugh at that? A 4 year old uncontrollably laughing at his mom because she had an untrusty toot.

"TIFU by saying, “you too!” Obligatory this happened a few years ago but it still haunts me.

I was at a bra shop, getting... well, bras. I’ve never had luck in the bra department, and I’ve never really been able to find one that I love and that fits me well. After being fitted at this store by a very kind young woman, she rang me up, handed me my bag, and said, “So glad I could help. Enjoy your new bras!” 

I had turned and was walking out as the heinous words spilled out of my mouth instinctually, “Thanks, you too!” 

Such is the response to the typical, “Have a great day!” My brain thought she knew what was coming and just went into auto. I hesitated slightly and then skittered out of the shop. I’ve never been back since. I order online, to hide my shame.

"TIFU by scaring the shit out of myself and burning my pp and hitting my head This actually happend like an hour ago. English is my first language however I am an idiot (as I will now prove)

It was about 0530 am and I haven't slept in about 24 hours now due to the whole ""one more episode before bed"" fiasco. I haven't eaten for about 9 hours so I decide to go downstairs and have some canned macaroni cheese before my stomach wakes the whole house up. 

For some much needed context I park my motorbike outside my front door even though it has been stolen twice from that very spot. I am also only wearing boxers and socks.

Once the bowls in the microwave I start cleaning the can out and hear some noises outside but chalk it up to a mixture of me being tired and the JD I had 4 hours ago to help me sleep quicker. 

I get my bowl of piping hot macaroni and carefully carry it towards my room but as I'm passing the front door I hear some more noises. So I creep up to the door to look through the window and dont see anything. In my infinite wisdom I decided to turn the light on behind me then have another quick check out of the window at my pride and joy. 

I look back at the window and about 6 inches away from the glass is a shirtless, homeless looking guys tearing into my very soul. Naturally I shit myself and slip backwards on the smooth floor, hit my head on the floor and manage to spill my macaroni cheese on my crotch which went straight though my boxers and really fucking hurts.

I rush to the shower after ripping my boxers off to try to cool my junk down and it is then that I realise that I got so scared of my own reflection that I managed to hit my head on the floor, burn my manhood and loose any pride I once had.  TIL: I need a fucking shave

"TIFU by eating a pot brownie Long time lurker, first time poster. Like most TIFU it didn't happen today but on December 31, 2020 



An earlier story reminded me of my New Year's. I decided to eat pot brownie, figured I was sleeping when I went into 2020 so being stoned for 2021 probably wouldn't make it worse. My roommate ate half of a brownie a few days earlier and felt nothing so I figure I can eat the other half. I should mention he smokes 3+ times a day and I don't know the last time I smoked weed. 


Twenty minutes later I know I'm in trouble. I thought these things took an hour to kick in and I'm already stoned. We're watching Grey's Anatomy, which was ""my show"", and all I can say is how awful that show is. I was on my third or fourth rewatch of that series but all I kept saying was how awful it was. Everything looked like it was shot in portrait mode and like just so cheesy. Roommate gets mad at me because somehow sober me is all about this show, he's gotten hooked but now I'm ruining it. Eventually he notices I'm high because I have the giggles and am just saying stupid shit just to entertain myself. After a bit I have to poop. I go upstairs and I'm sitting on the toilet when suddenly I forget how to poop. I don't know how to do it. I question if I am even pooping at that moment...what does it feels like? I don't fucking know. So I decide to just sit there until it feels 'right' to start wiping because obviously my body just knows how to poop. Poop finishes, standard amount of wipes, we good.


I don't know if any of you have experienced going to the bathroom and realising how messed up you are? I just experienced that, forgot how to poop, and now I have to navigate stairs. That just ain't happening. Lucky my bedroom is right next to the toilet so I'm going to sleep it off a bit. I lay there, convincing myself that no one has ever died from eating edibles, and just decide to enjoy the ride. I'm not sure if I feel asleep or the world just skipped a beat but then I realise I have to get downstairs because I am hungry but I still don't know how to do stairs. That being said somehow I make it downstairs without falling. I probably convinced myself that if I remember how to poop I should know how to do stairs but I don't know for sure. Get some munchies and start mowing down. 


While I'm eating the food I feel like I am just sinking into the couch, actually more like melting back into the couch. So I adjust myself forward but now I'm melting in that way so I lean back. This repeats over some period of time and then I'm done. Roommate tries to tell me what to do because I'm greening out but I don't care. I need to get back to bed. I make it back to my bed and I'm laying there hating how my weighed blanket feels but also needing to be under it because it helps anxiety just tripping balls. I don't remember how I know I was ""tripping balls"", but I just do. Next thing I know fireworks are waking me up at midnight.

"TIFU by hugging a stranger. This happened a loooooooong time ago, but I thought I should share it.

It was a hot summer day and my grandpa had decided to take me, my sis and cousins to the beach with his small green car, which I adore till this very day. My grandpa was sitting outside while we played in the sand. At some point, I went to take something from our beachbag and gave my grandpa a hug from behind ( ik it seems weird, but i was like 7ish) and said ""thanks grandpa for bringing us to the beach!""

He turned around and to my complete horror, it was not him....

then I remembered he said he would move to another spot bc there was plenty of sun exposure where we were originally sitting (I have a horrible memory)....

the man looked as confused as me. The only thing I could studder was a ""s-s-s-sorry....I thought you were m-m-m-my grandpa"" which made it even more akward. 

At this point I just ran off and finally remembered where my grandpa was ( he wasn't even that far, I still question how i didnt see him).

Til this very day, I wanna punch myself whenever I remeber it or it gets brought up (it has become my mum's and grandpa's favourite story).

I would control the pain majority of the time with just advil and tylenol but when I overdid it and was really hurting, I would take a prescribed combination of muscle relaxer and pain medication which I considered my ""zombie pills"" as they would make me feel pretty drowsy and out of it. 

This was my first Christmas Eve living with C. We had met online and lived on opposite sides of the country. We spent a year dating long distance before I had finally moved in with him in June. To celebrate our first Christmas together, and my first away from my family, we went all out. We had a HUGE Christmas Eve dinner which I did 90% of the cooking. We were spoiled with gifts from his family and we were just all super excited to be together for the first year. It was over and above! 

After dinner, I was in pain, knowing I had overdone things. I wanted to take my ""zombie pills"" about 9:00 pm and go to bed, however, I had to check in to a flight at midnight as I was flying across the country to see my family on Christmas day night. So instead, I stayed awake and pushed through the pain. At midnight I was able to check into my flight. I was hurting enough that I decided to take the zombie pills then. 

At 5:00 am my phone rang. It was tradition that we wake up at 7:00 am every year. My mom and brothers were awake (it was 7:00 am for them). C and I sleepily got out of bed and went to the living room and did a video call with my family. We decided since we were awake we might as well open our Christmas gifts. Once we were done, I was falling asleep on the couch and so C told me to go to bed for awhile longer. 

A few hours later he woke me up and with the promise of making me bacon, I got out of bed and went to the kitchen. We put bacon in the oven and he prompted me to look at the tree, he had forgot a gift earlier. I felt SO out of it, but I went to the tree and saw nothing underneath. He encouraged me to keep looking and I found a bag hanging on the tree. I just knew. I knew that inside that bag would be a ring. I pulled it off the tree and sure enough, there was a ring box. I opened the box and it was empty. When I turned around, he was on one knee and he asked me to be his forever. The first thing I said was ""get up"" and then of course I said yes. 

I cry at every single proposal video and story, and yet, I didn't cry at my own proposal. I felt like I was smiling bigger than ever, and yet my insides were numb. I felt like a zombie. Everything was just a bit muted. C was expecting me to cry, he was expecting a ton of emotion and excitement and although I was trying to exude emotion, I felt like I was faking it. C kept asking me if I was ok and I kept having to reassure him that I was happy. 

He still teases me for not crying during our proposal. 

It turned out ok, that was 5 years ago and we have now been married 3.5 years. I am happier than I have ever been. But that moment that should have been so exciting and special, was ZOMBIED and muted. 

 Tl;dr: Took pain meds that made me feel like a zombie and it muted my emotions so that when my husband proposed he didn't think I meant it when I said yes.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'ruining', 'my',

"Found out my girl created an OnlyFans We had talked about it to bring in some extra money because she’s pretty hot. Most of our convos were just in a sarcastic joking matter. Then I made a joke about it the other day and she told me she started one. At first I was was pretty pissed that she didn’t tell me that she started one. Then she showed it to me. Said she wasn’t hiding it from but she just had started and hadn’t really got going with it. After seeing some of her sexy pics on there and the guys commenting on how hot and sexy she is. I know they’re saying nasty things to her and she’s saying them back. Now that she’s going with it, I’m so turned on that all these other guys are getting off to her.

"TIFU by stabbing myself after sex Ok, the title is little bit clickbait. Sorta. I did stab myself after all...

Context: it's new year's eve and me and gf are staying at an Airbnb for the moment. We went to buy some groceries and when we got back surprise surprise there was no light. It's Rio de Janeiro so you can imagine how freaking hot it is. 
Despise all this, gf was looking SO hot in that outfit that I couldn't resist and initiated sexy times. Mistake number one that I don't regret.
After, well, you know, sex, I wanted to make us a drink. We bought ice and I was cutting it. I was so out of it that I went full force on the now melting ice. Mistake number two that I DO regret. Result: I ended up stabbing myself on the belly.
Me and gf are physicians and checked the wound... No stitches needed. But I was sweaty and dirty and there was blood. A lot of it.

"TIFU by trying helping my grandma use the TV remote... and scalding my crotch in the process. TIFU (earlier this evening) when I (28M) got up off the armchair in order to help my grandma operate the TV remote. She couldn’t find the volume controls and trying to explain across the room wasn’t working - so I got up to show her instead. 

The catch? 

Moments before I had been handed a hot cup of tea, and somehow my dumb brain had already disregarded this information. 

It took me a second to realise what was wrong but when I did, I let out a pretty good shriek. Almost the entire mug emptied directly onto my crotch/lap, also dousing the almost brand new furniture where I was sitting. I probably couldn’t have aimed it any better if I’d tried. Direct hit.

Moments later my parents rushed downstairs to help, my grandma was confused (later found out at first she thought I was just goofing off), and I was still trying to process what had just happened. 

After briefly trying to help mop up the tea from the chair, I went upstairs to inspect the damage that I’d inflicted on myself. 

My thighs had turned a nice pink colour, and I felt very uncomfortable but I couldn’t see any blistering and thankfully my genitals seemed to be relatively unscathed. 

One cold bath later and I’m now sat on the couch that didn’t get flooded, feeling sore and annoyed, but relieved it wasn’t much worse. 
 
TL;DR: spilled almost an entire cup of tea onto my crotch while getting up from a brand new armchair to try and help my grandma with the TV remote. 0/10, would not recommend.

"I still have nightmares about my ex Didn't really know what group to put this on, so hope this one is OK.

I broke up with my ex about 8.5 years ago. He never physically abused me, but was very controlling. He made me feel guilty when I saw or talked about my family. He hated my best friend (shes gay and he was jealous, saying she fancied me). He would turn agressive at the flick of a switch (again, never actually touched me). We couldn't have a night out without him ruining it. We went out for 2 years, and lived together for a year. 

Anyway, about a month after we broke up I met a guy I had met through friends a few years before and started dating. Been together ever since and our relationship is great.

But I still have nightmares about my ex. We will be dating again and half way through the dream I start thinking 'WTF am I doing??' but can't escape him or can't pluck up the courage to dump him, or sometimes I dream I start going crazy at him. I feel like I'm suffocating, then I wake up and I can't describe the relief I feel that it wasn't real!

"TIFU by trying to be happy A bit of backstory, I have a roommate who owns a large quantity of collectibles. Additionally, I’ve been having some problems in my personal life relating to mental health.

Today I got up and at 4:00 am and decided that I’d start cooking my lunches in the mornings before work as a way to help with mental wellness. I got everything ready and put on a backpack to hold my food and went out in stride. Evidently that was a bad idea because it was dark and I wasn’t watching where I was going and I accidentally knocked over my roommate’s Alien Queen figure and it broke.

I had to get to work so I picked up all the pieces, left them on the coffee table, and sent him a text explaining what happened. He’s usually a calm guy, but he got understandably irate. I apologized, but he said that sorry won’t fix or replace it. He sent me a link to the Amazon page for it and it was worth $350. So I lost almost an entire week’s worth of pay for not being careful.

"TIFU by giving my neighbor eggs This happened 24 hours ago, but I wanted to wait just in case something changed. Obligatory “I’m on mobile” disclaimer. 

I was home alone watching Hulu and eating a square of Dove chocolate, when my neighbor knocked on my door to ask for some eggs. A little weird, but whatever. When I opened the door, my puppy tried to run out! He’s a 4 month old Yorkipoo who just finished getting his shots on Sunday, but the vet told us he’s not allowed to go for walks until next week. We live in an apartment complex with a lot of dogs, so I panicked because I didn’t want him to get Parvo.   This is our first dog, so I’m extra paranoid. I scooped him up and put him on the couch before I went to the fridge. 

I grab the eggs and focus on not dropping them (I’m a bit of a klutz) and take them to my neighbor. She thanks me and heads back to her unit.

I turn around, excited to get back to my show, and I hear the puppy licking something. I thought, “what the hell did he find now?” Well, I left a piece of chocolate on the side table that he was able to reach from the couch. Yup. He had a square of Dove brand milk chocolate fully wrapped in foil in his tiny little mouth. My heart dropped. I quickly pulled the wrapper out of his mouth and called my parents, who were minutes from home. I’m a wreck. I grab the puppy and run outside and wait for them to pull up. I couldn’t breathe. Had a full blown panic attack. Tears and snot everywhere. The puppy is in the backseat crying and confused. My mom is yelling at me to find the directions to the emergency vet, but my hands don’t work and I can’t think straight. I manage to do it and we’re on our way. It was supposed to be a 13 minute drive, but it was in this weird industrial area that neither of us are familiar with. We missed our exit on the freeway and the GPS keeps taking us in circles. By this time, 45 minutes had passed. All I could think is, “Oh god, I killed my puppy.” 

My mom gives up after searching for an extra 10 minutes, and shouts that we are going home. NO. I get it together and call the Vet’s number to ask them their cross streets. They tell me to get on the phone with Poison Control until we get to the vet. Five minutes later, we’re there and its *packed*. The puppy is fine, being his happy little self, no sign of any reaction to be found. We wait, and we wait, and we wait. It was taking so long, I was ready to pay $700 so they could take care of it immediately. They finally took him in. I was in queue to talk to PC for about 30 minutes, they finally pick up, and I tell them what happened. 

Turns out, it takes SIX Dove Milk Chocolate Squares to have an affect on the dog. They said I had nothing to worry about. You have to pay for the call, so that was $75. The vet later came out and told us the same thing, and asked if I still wanted them to induce vomiting (which would’ve been over $100). My mom says it’s okay, so we take him home and monitor his behavior. 

Nothing happened. He was fine and happy and having fun once we were home. The only thing we noticed is a little extra yellow tinge in his pee. He’s right here napping next to me, and I’m appreciating him extra. It was one of the worst panic attacks I’ve ever had. Had a massive headache from crying until I finally fell asleep. But we’re all here, happy and healthy!

But man, that was one expensive piece of chocolate. 

TL;DR  Puppy got into some chocolate while I was getting some eggs for my neighbor. Had a massive panic attack, took forever to get to the vet, but he didn’t need any treatment. Everyone is fine now.

Edit: Okay, it’s not weird to ask a neighbor for eggs.

"TIFU by telling my friends I filled a sandwich baggy with lotion and stuck it between the mattress and fucked it This actually happened about 15 years ago when I was younger.  But I found a website back in the early 2000s that gave ideas for masturbating that feel more like sex.  So my dumb 11 year old self came across one that said if you fill up a sandwich baggy with lotion and stick it between the mattress, that’s how sex would feel.  

I tried it but that shit was messy and awful, but my penis was nice and smooth because of the nice lotion.  

I ended up telling some friends and they ended up telling everyone else.  And I was known as the mattress fucking kid.

"I cut off my suicidal friend and I’m terrified he will end his life hi sorry this is long but I really need advice I’m terrified! so I met this friend in around April last year and we quickly became best friends. He opened up about his struggles with depression from before I knew him but things started to get bad again late summer. he started having these episodes were he would emotionally blackmail and just be awful. They started happing like every 2 weeks and would last for a day or two. these episodes were triggered by small things and somethings our friendship triggered them for example things such as me saying I wasn’t able to meet him and me having more pictures of another friend than him on my wall. these episodes are completely irrational. In these episodes he’s called me a two faced self centred bitch he’s said that when he kills him self I can blame myself and he’s said he will cut himself to death if I don’t reply right now. it got to the point where I was ignoring his abusive messages and he told me that was pointless cause he could emotionally blackmail me all he wants. He’s said stuff like reply or else.... and by that he means he will kill himself. he once said he was gonna go hurt myself and I could blame myself. I called his mum straight away btw. but when I asked him what he meant he said haha I guess u will have to wait and see.He was always apologetic after these episodes and he isn’t like this out of these. However he became super reliant on me in daily life and I would freak out if I couldn’t meet him worrying it would cause him to do something. I have hyper sensitive issues regarding touch and he would often hug me multiple times and touch my neck as a joke which I stated made me uncomfortable (I’m also a girl and he’s a guy) and he would say but it helps my depression and that I’m never affectionate with him even tho it’s a part of my adhd and I can’t help it. the last episode he had was triggered by me having more pics on my wall of a different friend and he wanted me to rate my friends which I refused to do and he then blocked me and a lot of the stuff I said above he said. He unblocked me the next day and continued to say horrible stuff but At this point I was hysterical so I didn’t reply to his constant messages and calls (he repeatedly called me and texted my name and said I promised I would never do this to him) He even texted my mum saying that I didn’t care about him by ignoring him and then when she said I needed a break he said maybe I should show you who your daughter really is..... we haven’t spoken since then and I can see now how toxic the friendship was. It truly messed me if caused me to relapse in self harm which I haven’t struggled with for a while and I was in a constant state of worry (I still am) he is now telling everyone I didn’t care about him even tho I dropped everything to help him multiple times. He once went missing and I spent hours looking  for him etc so I definetly cared a lot. he said I abandoned him and that I knew cause of me dropping him might now end up dead and that I didn’t care tho. I’m terrified he will die by suicide as he is very high risk. He’s said many times he wouldn’t be alive without me and that he would probably kill himself if it wasn’t for me. His family are very aware but he refuses to let therapy work and refuses to try and change anything. If he kills himself I truly believe it will be a chain reaction caused by me dropping him as he is now trying to drop all his friends and blocked a ton of them before they can drop him like I did. Me dropping him has worsened everything and made his attachment issues worse but It was a joint desicion between me, his mum and my mum even tho he blames it all on me and my mum. I’m so scared I’ve barely slept and I can’t bare the thought of someone ending their life because of me especially someone I care about that much.",0,"['cut', 'off', 'my', 'suicidal', 'friend', 'and',

is long but really need advice i’m terrified so met this friend in around april last year and we quickly became best friends he opened up about his struggles with depression from before knew him but things started to get bad again late summer he started having these episodes were he would emotionally blackmail and just be awful they started happing like every weeks and would last for day or two these episodes were triggered by small things and somethings our friendship triggered them for example things such as me saying wasn’t able to meet him and me having more pictures of another friend than him on my wall these episodes are completely irrational in these episodes he’s called me two faced self centred bitch he’s said that when he kills him self can blame myself and he’s said he will cut himself to death if don’t reply right now it got to the point where was ignoring his abusive messages and he told me that was pointless cause he could emotionally blackmail me all he wants he’s said stuff like reply or else and by that he means he will kill himself he once said he was gonna go hurt myself and could blame myself called his mum straight away btw but when asked him what he meant he said haha guess will have to wait and see he was always apologetic after these episodes and he isn’t like this out of these however he became super reliant on me in daily life and would freak out if couldn’t meet him worrying it would cause him to do something have hyper sensitive issues regarding touch and he would often hug me multiple times and touch my neck as joke which stated made me

"TIFU by jumping on a treadmill I once tried to jump onto a treadmill and start running at this random person's house (we were at a party idk why), I made it but it was SUPER sketchy, (I almost fell off)

FORESHADOWING: There was a pole behind me...

my idiot cousin saw and asked me to do it again because it was ""super cool"" I tried again and made it (once again sketchy and with the pole behind me)

and then he said I should do it backwards, I did it (because my stupid 13yo mind was a dumb piece of garbage)

I was stupid enough to forget that you are supposed to run FORWARDS on a treadmill and since I was

backward I should've ran backwards, (and my eyes don't grow on the back of my head) well, I didn't 

know how to run backwards so my face smacked into the pole and I had this giant bruise on my face 

for 6 months. (This is 6 months after the incident).

A tip to these random kids who live on the Earth: (KIDS TREADMILLS ARE DANGEROUS DON'T USE THESE ADULT TORTURE DEVICES)

I think im gonna get a blow job from an escort without a condom fuc it. we only live once right? Im 20 and i dont have any sexual experience really. Im not a virgin(lost it to an escort) which was an eye opening experience for me but one thing i didnt get to experience was what it's like to have a blow job. The escort i got with last time did suc me a little bit but i couldnt really feel anything with the condom on.

"TIFU by forgetting my master password Today I downloaded a budgeting app and a password safe app. The budgeting app links my bank account and various other accounts I have by entering username and password for the account. I mainly use biometric login for my banking/finance apps, therefore I couldn't remember passwords and reset them. As I reset passwords, I stored the new information in the password safe app.

The fuck up happened when I forgot the master password for my password safe app....so now I lost all of the passwords I just reset, cause I sure didn't try to remember any of them.

The silver lining, I use biometric login for all of the apps with reset passwords, so at least I don't have to reset my passwords again anytime soon

"TIFU By Being Hungry At Work This happened yesterday and I’m still recovering. My body will eventually recover. My spirit may not. 

So I work in film. Mostly art department. Yesterday I was working on a commercial for an upcoming food series. We had people specifically for food art. They would cook and style all of the food that we needed for the shots. After it was done and we were resetting the table I would sometimes see the food artists eating what they were done with. This made me assume all the food was safe to eat. 

Working in film often consists of long days, and even though we’re provided food there isn’t always a moment where you can grab a snack. So toward the end of the day I was HUNGRY. 

We finished up a shot of some olives in this beautiful bowl. I confirmed the olives were wrapped for the day and that they were no longer needed. I then decide to eat the olives. 

I had eaten a few in quick succession so I didn’t really realize they had a weird taste to them. I had already fully swallowed when the food artist starts freaking out. 

“Oh my god don’t eat those they’re in wood polish”

Apparently to catch the light a little better they put the olives in some sort of industrial polish. Which is why they tasted so weird. Which is then why I started to feel sick. 

Now keep in mind I didn’t ingest a ton of the polish because it was whatever was on the olives. But that didn’t stop my body from rejecting it. Not a few minutes later I was vomiting in a tiny bathroom. 

We had a set medic on site and they called poison control and I ended up at hospital just to be safe. I feel awful but I’m okay.

"I'm waiting on a guy I matched with at the begining of lockdown, but I'm getting impatient. We met on Tinder and have been texting every day since, save for a handful of days.
I really like him so far and he's shown clear interest. We've had conversations about the possibility of a relationship and intimacy. Due to current times, and his health, we've only been able to meet once in 6+ months. I've asked him about starting a relationship 3 times already, and every time he says he wants to wait and see where it goes, and the last time he apologized for being slow.
So today I redownload Tinder (I deleted it shortly after we started talking) and since we haven't discussed commitments, I replied to a match who messaged me first.
I'm mildly concerned that I don't feel guilty, because the first guy is really nice and has shown clear interest.",0,"[""i'm"", 'waiting', 'on', 'guy', 'matched', 'with', 'at', 'the', 'begining', 'of', 'lockdown', 'but', ""i'm"", 'getting', 'impatient', 'we', 'met', 'on', 'tinder', 'and', 'have', 'been', 'texting', 'every', 'day', 'since', 'save', 'for', 'handful', 'of', 'days', 'really', 'like', 'him', 'so', 'far', 'and', ""he's"", 'shown', 'clear', 'interest', ""we've"", 'had', 'conversations', 'about', 'the', 'possibility', 'of', 'relationship', 'and', 'intimacy', 'due', 'to', 'current', 'times', 'and', 'his', 'health', ""we've"", 'only', 'been', 'able', 'to', 'meet', 'once', 'in', 'months', ""i've"", 'asked', 'him', 'about', 'starting', 'relationship', 'times', 'already', 'and', 'every', 'time', 'he', 'says', 'he', 'wants', 'to', 'wait', 'and', 'see', 'where', 'it', 'goes', 'and', 'the', 'last', 'time', 'he', 'apologized', 'for', 'being', 'slow', 'so', 'today', 'redownload', 'tinder', 'deleted', 'it', 'shortly', 'after', 'we', 'started', 'talking', 'and', 'since', 'we', ""haven't"", 'discussed', 'commitments', 'replied', 'to', 'match', 'who', 'messaged', 'me', 'first', ""i'm"", 'mildly', 'concerned', 'that', ""don't"", 'feel', 'guilty', 'because', 'the', 'first', 'guy', 'is', 'really', 'nice', 'and', 'has', 'shown', 'clear', 'interest']",i'm waiting on guy matched with at the begining of lockdown but i'm getting impatient we met on tinder and have been texting every day since save for handful of days really like him so far and he's shown clear interest we've had conversations about the possibility of relationship and intimacy due to current times and his health we've only been able to meet once in months i've asked him about starting relationship times already and every time he says he wants to wait and see where it goes and the last time he apologized for being slow so today redownload tinder deleted it shortly after we started talking and since we haven't discussed commitments replied to match who messaged me first i'm mildly concerned that don't feel guilty because the first guy is really nice and has shown clear interest,i'm waiting on guy matched with at the begining of lockdown but i'm getting impatient we met on tinder and have been texting every day since save for handful of day really like him so far and he's shown clear interest we've had conversation about the possibility of relationship and intimacy due to current time and his health we've only been able to meet once in month i've asked him about starting relationship time already and every time he say he want to wait and see where it go and the last time he apologized for being slow so today redownload tinder deleted it shortly after we started talking and since we haven't discussed commitment replied to match who messaged me first i'm mildly concerned that don't feel guilty because the first guy is really nice and ha shown clear interest,i'm wait on guy match with at the begin of lockdown but i'm get impati we met on tinder and have been text everi day sinc save for hand of day realli like him so far and he' shown clear interest we'v had convers about the possibl of relationship and intimaci due to current time and hi health we'v onli been abl to meet onc in month i'v ask him about start relationship time alreadi and everi time he say he want to wait and see where it goe and the last time he apolog for be slow so today redownload tinder delet it shortli after we start talk and sinc we haven't discuss commit repli to match who messag me first i'm mildli concern that don't feel guilti becaus the first guy is realli nice and ha shown clear interest
"TIFU by joking about a strip club on my church friends Facebook TIFU by joking about a strip club on my church friends Facebook

So for those that don’t know, Facebook has these group pages where often it feels “safer” to say dumb shit because it’s more anonymous.

A lot of local group pages are about actual local stuff (like a page dedicated to the town I live)

Someone in that group asked “what would you say is our community’s greatest need”

And just being a smart ass, I instantly replied: “Strip. Club.”

Only after an hour or so did I go back to check replies and noticed the person who started the thread was someone from a Small Group I did at church (and he’s literally like....a pastor)

I thought he meant “what kind of thing do you want to see in our city?” And instead he probably meant “what is a need the people have that we could help with?” (Like helping the poor)

So not only did I come across as an idiot but I revealed myself to be a deviant. Well done.

"Should I out a possibly continuing pedophile?  

Almost 15 years ago. From ages 9 to 11 (I think, from memory) my mum and dad would hire a babysitter every few weeks. He was an older boy, 5 years older, from our local church. After my brothers went to bed he would come to my room and make me have oral sex with him. I remember thinking how big his dick was and how disgusting he smelt. (He is/was not a well-groomed person). This lasted a year or two.

I never told anyone about it, and just pushed it out of my mind, until last year my friend somehow got it out of me due to a very precise set of questions, and he figured it out somehow, although I didn't tell him who.

Anyway, now I have been thinking about this guy a lot more, I knew he was part of the church, but it turns out he leads the children's church and I looked up his Facebook he organizes Christian children's weekends away, he volunteers to travel to 3rd world countries in Asia to places there seems to be lots of children and his main photo is him hugging surrounded by children. It makes me feel a little bit sick.

Part of me feels like I should let someone know, maybe I should tell my parents (I left the church as soon as possible) but also he wasn't an adult either at the time, he was 15,16, so maybe it was just immaturity on his part. But I believe it is possible this is continuing when and where he has the possibility too. (He hasn't grown up and got a gf, or a wife or anything, he comes across as a creep still).

"TIFU by giving one of my twins laxtives. This happened yesterday. My twins are 3 year old fraternal girls that recently graduated to using the downstairs powder room to go potty instead of the dump cups. Twin A has no issue with number 1 or number 2 but Twin B is a different story. Twin B is a clencher. She holds her poop. I have a total of 4 kids and she is the only one to ever do this. Her pediatrician reccomended Pedia-lax (stool softener for kids) make the job easier when the time came. So 2 days of OTC Pedia-lax and still no poop. 

Then comes day 3. Everything is normal and on schedule. Nothing out of the ordinary. Potty time comes and Twin A is in and out in about 5 minutes. Twin B's turn. She seemed tense. Like more tense than usual. She holds the potty seat on the toilet and locks her knees together. She's clenching. So to help the process, I hold her legs up so she has no way of clenching. She's getting upset and angry. I try to tell her to just let it go. 

Then I smell it. I pick her up and there it is. The largest poo I have ever seen in my entire life. I was shook. I clean Twin B up and get her settled in the playroom. Then make my way back to the impossibly gargantuan poo my little princess dropped off. I didn't know what to do. If I flushed it the toilet would definitely clog. I took a picture of it and sent it to my husband asking what I should do. He's an OTR truck driver and usually misses out on adventures like this. He calls me immediately laughing, joking that the poo looks like it's the size of Twin B's arm. He's not wrong. Then he tells me to break it up with the plunger. Well, that's not gonna work because not only is it long and poking out of the toilet water like a choco crocodile but it also has some girth to it. I'm freaking out at this moment because I know what I have to do. I grab an old steak knife that no one loves and attempt to cut the poo log into smaller ""poolettes"". 

It's like clay. The smell is horrid. I start dry heaving. My 2 sons and husband are all laughing hysterically. This is hell. I'm in hell. I get it down to about 4 slices and toss the newly dubbed ""poop knife"" in the trash. Then, with plunger in hand, I flush. It went down no problem and now I am 100% invested in helping Twin B have a regular poo schedule.

I am traumatized.
Never again.

TL;DR:

To avoid clogging a toilet I chopped a record breaking log of poo (courtesy of my 3 yr old daughter) in to 4 pieces with a steak knife. Which I quickly found out was my worse nightmare.

"TIFU by prepaying a hooker Ight look so me and this girl were talking for a couple weeks. She was really fuckin beautiful, had a nice ass and all that you know? Definately outta my league. She was gonna come over today and hang out and stuff. She is coming from about an hour and a half from me so that’s sweet of her. We have been FaceTiming and all that so I know she real for sure. She kept telling me how excited she was but nervous and I was super nervous myself. Well she starts heading my way. She is still texting me and everything while she drives here. When she says she is about 10 minutes away I go into my room and light this candle she said she really liked. Yes I went out and bought a fucking candle she liked. And made my bed real quick. Well I also sent her $50 jus for gas or whatever. She didn’t ask for it or anything or even hint at wanting money. Well once she saw she got $50 from me... she ghosted me... blocked me on everything. My friends keep telling me I prepaid a hooker which I don’t understand. Where did I go wrong? Please tell me.

"TIFU by putting insane amounts of pressure on my leg and almost getting sterilized while celebrating the new year Alright, today is the first day of the new year, and I might as well have been the first injury of 2021.  

What happened was, I have this pair of truck horns, which I got when I was a kid.  I don't have an air compressor, so there is a hand pump to blow air through the horns.  The pump needs to be pretty sturdy to expel enough air to get these things going, 50-60 PSI at minimum I'd estimate, as they usually would use like 120 PSI on a compressor.  So, the pump is made of steel, and fairly beefy.  It requires so much force that typically a smaller person won't get the second horn to go (low pitch and higher pitched horns are connected together to make a chord, the higher ones are harder to make sound with), but thankfully I'm able to.  

Anyway, on to what actually happened, since it's new years and this was a pretty crappy year, I'd decided to inform the entire neighborhood (and probably the surrounding city) that the new year was here, and brought up the horns from the basement.  I set them on the back porch, and watched my watch for the timing.  I had the air canister portion of the pump in my hands, and planning to slam the handle end into my leg to sound the horns, in hopes of making them be louder.  At exactly midnight, I slammed the air pump into my leg, the force depressing the handle into the pump, making the horns blow.  Unfortunately, this did not go to plan.  Remember how I said the thing was made of steel?  Well, it slipped right off my sweatpants, right into my genitals.  I didn't notice the pain right away, but it came.  Oh, I forgot to mention, the handle was shaped like an old fashioned ship wheel, so there was more pain than there could have been.  So there I am, laying on the ground in pain, wondering why I didn't just use the ground Instead.  

Turns out, that wasn't all the damage.  I hit my leg so hard there was even some internal bleeding, and two huge welts.  

TL;DR: wanted my truck horns to be louder and doing so caused me to almost be sterilized and caused great bruising to my leg


Happy ending though, I was eventually able to compose myself and used the ground Instead, let me just say it yielded much better results.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'putting', 'insane', 'amounts', 'of',

"TIFU by drinking with my girlfriend Obligatory happened last


My girlfriend decided she wanted to get drunk last night. well after drinking quite a bit we both decided we’d take one last shot and call it a night. I pour the shots and next thing I know things start getting spicy. After a couple minutes of making out we decided to take the shot then go to our bedroom. By this time I’ve gotten myself pretty excited (also we don’t have any clothes on by this point.) My girlfriend who is fairly drunk, spilled  her shot directly onto my penis. The burn was literally immediate. It felt like some took an entire tube of icy hot to my cock and balls, and then by the time I got it under control she was slumped in bed, and I was left alone with nothing but my burning dick and disappointment.

"TIFU by oversleeping I am a teenager that struggles to balance everything I have to do and naturally I loose sleep because of that. I have to take the bus to school, (see what the fuck up revolves around) even though my dad is still home as he doesn’t leave until 9:00 and he would have to get me there at 8:15 before I’m late he refuses to take me. He has yelled at me, insulted me, and taken away stuff I enjoy, but that’s not what I’m mad about, most of that was well deserved, I’m upset as he refused to take me to school despite having nothing stopping him. Luckily for me there’s an online option too since covid but I need to be in person as I have ADHD and can barely focus so all I will be getting from doing online school is attendance. 
            I now understand why my sister has moved far away from us as she would have had to deal with him acting like this on a daily basis. I’m writing this in the 5 minute transition from one class to another so I won’t be back until my lunch in a few hours.

"I like eating cake upside down No, I don't mean like I go upside down and eat like a bat or Spiderman, but for example if I got a slice of cake and put it on my plate, I flip it and place it upside down so the icing is at the bottom and the bottom with the sponge is at top.
There's nothing too special seeing how it doesn't change the flavor or anything, but I personally like doing this because I can also take the cake pieces and ""dip"" them in icing. My friends think it's unusual, but I think it's kinda cool.

"TIFU by accidentally texting my co-worker that he was going to be fired.. and celebrating it. This happened two years ago while working my first job out of college. I just recently thought about how fucking awful (hilarious) this was and wanted to share.

Myself along with about 5 friends from college all landed the same entry level sales role with a startup tech company in the Bay Area. We were all from the Midwest so working together at a start up in California was super cool. We had happy hours on the beach almost everyday; we were broke, post grads living on the west coast. 

We made some friends that were locals, and all around our age. Majority easy going, motivated young professionals trying to make a name for ourselves. Except for this damn new kid.

At about 8 months into the job, one of our friends, Johnny, made his way to a team lead position- so he was now essentially on the way to becoming a manager &amp; sort of helping out the new hires.

Shortly after securing his first promotion, team lead of about 30 entry level sales folks, our 45 year old manager was suddenly fired. 

This made way for the possibility of Johnny (24 year old), our good friend to become our direct manager.. Sort of awesome, and sort of very awkward.

After a couple weeks of our director being indecisive about whether to have Johnny be the manager of essentially his 30 friends.. the decision was final. Johnny is now our manager.

Back to this new kid - we’ll call him Chad. Chad was born and raised in California, a bit different than the majority of our friends we had met that had moved in from out of state for the job. Chad loved to talk about his daddy’s money, Cars, numerous homes, and would leave work early (starting the first week of the job) to play golf. 

He found ways to cheat at work, constantly hit on the very few women at the company, took advantage of having a young friendly manager, and all around became pretty well hated amongst our team. 

Everyone wanted Chad fired. I was essentially begging Johnny to fire him as I couldn’t stand him, knew he didn’t need the money, and just all around didn’t think he deserved the job.

One morning (we had to get to work at 5:30am working east coast hours) Johnny pulls me into a room and tells me he got approval to let go of Chad. I was fucking ecstatic! I didn’t have to deal with this fucking guy any longer, he was going to be fired in a couple hours. Johnny made sure to tell me not to tell a soul and this was between us, he couldn’t hold it in and not tell me because he knew I’d be stoked.

I rushed back to my desk, went to text my co-worker the great news: I typed - “Dude Chad is getting fired today hahaha thank fuck” 

I texted it to Chad.. he comes over to my desk, showing me my text message, on his phone, with watery eyes. I had no idea what to do, I nervously laughed and said “I mean it is what it is man, you wanna go talk it out?” 

He says “no, Johnny we need to talk, with his voice quivering holding back tears”

They leave the room and I instantly feel awful, know that now my job and Johnny job are on the line.

Chad wasn’t fired because HR got involved and felt bad for him. I had numerous meetings with HR and my director. Chad left on his own, and got a better job a few months later. After MONTHS of awkwardly passing him in the hallway &amp; not speaking to anyone.

I was almost fired, along with Johnny for the way we handled the situation. That was Johnny first month as a manager. Johnny is still a a manger there today. I left a couple months later for a competitor. 

I still hate Chad but feel awful for how that went down. I also quadruple check who the recipient is that I am texting whenever I am talking shit. 

TL;DR: My friend was my manager and let me know he was going to fire this kid the whole company hated (Chad). When I got the news, I texted Chad accidentally and said “Dude Chad is getting fired today hahaha thank fuck” and almost lost my job while he kept his",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'accidentally', 'texting',

"TIFU by getting banned from Habbo for over 20 years. So I've seen a post going around Reddit recently about a guy who got banned from Yahoo Chess, and it reminded me of something that once happened to me. Obligatory this happened ages ago, probably about 8 or 9 years ago to be precise.

When I was around 16, my girlfriend at the time told me that she never played Habbo (or Habbo Hotel) when she was a kid. This shocked me, as all my friends and I used to wile away countless hours on that game, so I resolved to show her what she was missing out on. We both made accounts (I couldn't remember my old account from when I was a kid), and jumped into the game, both sitting in our own houses. Here's where the FU happened. I made the mistake of asking my girlfriend, using the in-game chat, if she wanted to hang out on the weekend in real life. Apparently, they don't take too kindly to people asking that question in a game made for children. A few minutes later I was kicked out of my account, and a message popped up telling me I was banned for, if memory serves, 21 years. On top of all of that, my girlfriend didn't even like the game.

"TIFU by not realizing that zoom doesn't mirror your video on other people's screens So today I found out that zoom doesn't mirror your video in other people's view. I had my video settings set to ""mirror video"" and just assumed the mirrored view of myself would be what everyone else sees. Well, IT'S NOT. 

Here's where I messed up: I can get anxious during zoom meetings, so I sometimes secretly hold a stuffed animal to help me feel better. On my screen, I always make sure to hide the stuffed animal behind the little box that says my name so that people can't tell that I'm holding a stuffed animal. Someone mentioned something about it to me at one of my zoom meetings, so I just assumed that I had accidentally moved the stuffed animal into view. Since then, I have been extra, extra careful with my positioning of the stuffed animal--making sure that it never moves from its hiding place behind my name box.

I was bored during a long meeting today and decided to mess around with my video settings. I unchecked the box for the mirror video setting and realized that not only was my red panda build a bear visible, I had positioned myself so closely to the corner that I thought was hiding him that I had accidentally actually placed him in an awkwardly prominent place. I messaged my friend who was in the meeting like ""wtf,, everyone can see that I'm holding a stuffed animal right now??!?"" and they said ""yeah, I just thought it was really cute."" 

So, it turns out that I--a 21-year-old dude--have been holding a stuffed animal IN FULL VIEW of everyone else in multiple zoom meetings FOR WEEKS. FML

"TIFU by taking my conservative mother and brother paddle boarding by a nude beach. Im in hawaii, today was the perfect warm, not windy day. Ive been paddle boarding tons of times, and my mother and brother have not. I had gone out and went to see where the water was calmer so they could try and stand up in minimal waves. Me, wasnt paying attention to shore comes back to get my mum and brother to take them over there. We get over there, and when my mum sees the beach she got this look on her face and quickly tries to hide it. I look to the beach to see what she was looking at, well fuck 30+ ass naked teen-60s id say. Needless to say they stood up elsewhere, and my mother kept looking at me in an awkward wtf did you make me see way. My brother on the other hand was overjoyed and continually smirked at me. Yeah, you're welcome kid, theres a bunch of tits and ass -\_-

Oh then there was a blacktip shark, and so my brother wouldnt freak out i told him it was a turtle. He didnt see it, so he believed it lmao.

"TIFU by stealing my friend's sister's panties My story is so ridiculous, idk if you guys are going to believe it.

I   was staying at my friend's house across the country and her sister was   gone, so she and the family told me to sleep in her room. I thought  that  was really weird to be sleeping in her bed, but whatever I guess.  Well  on the day I left, I woke up and I was all groggy, i had a hard  time  sleeping and I didn't fall asleep until 2 am or so, woke up at  4:30 for  my train, and I go over to open the drawer to get the shit I  stored,  well I opened the wrong one and I didn't notice cuz I was all  groggy and  the drawers (idk if i translated it wrong) looked the same.  The drawer I  opened was her underwear draw and opening it caused an  open container  of some lotion cream shit to spill on the underwear. It  looked like  jizz. I freaked out, I tried washing it out, and I couldn't  get rid of  it, if anything it made it worse. There was no fucking way  people were  going to believe what happened, thankfully it only spilled  on one pair  of underwear and all of her underwear looked identical.

I   took the underwear, stuffed it at the bottom of my backpack and I  left,   I felt so guilty. I go to my girlfriend's house and she opens my   backpack to do my laundry and she found the pair of panties. She asked   me WTF this was, started accusing me of cheating and shit. I explained   myself and she realized I was telling the truth because I can't lie  for  shit, she sees right through it if i ever try to ever joke or  anything.  I'm also kind of a clumsy dumbass so this isn't unbelievable.  She is  however upset that I won't return the underwear. I don't want  to return  it, I just want to throw it away and get rid of it. There's  no way  they're going to believe me when I tell them the story, and the  fact my  girlfriend has her panties makes it worse. She won't tell me  where she  put them. She's telling me I need to tell them what happened,  and she  won't give them to me until I tell them. I'm pissed at my  girlfriend and  we got into a massive argument over it. I eventually did  find them and I  burned them. My girlfriend lost her shit over that  saying how precious  panties are to girls or some shit. These wern't  expensive ones either,  it was clearly the bulk type you'd buy 20 for 10  euros or the ones you'd  see for sale in the sketchy tunnel ways or  next to train stations,  right by the kebab shops, the knife/military  gear stores and the soccer  jersey stands.

My girlfriend have been fighting over this, and I feel guilty about it, but I think not telling is the best coarse of option.

"TIFU trying to send money to my son My son is homeless at the moment two states away from me. He just needs money for a motel room for a couple of nights. We talk to the motel but they needed the actual card to run for the room. Ok, I send him to an ATM where I can generate a code to give him access. The transaction was declined. We try again, declined. I send him to Western Union. On his bike, because he doesn’t own a car. I try to send the cash but my transactions are all declined. Mind you I have plenty of $ in the bank, so that’s not the issue. I send him back to the ATM, and now my account is blocked. I finally had to Paypal some cash to a friend of his. From what I can tell, that went through.

Then I noticed a text from my bank. All I had to do was type Y to allow the first transaction at the first ATM to go through. I feel like a moron, and sent my son everywhere on his bike in the freezing cold.

"TIFU by getting fed up with my noisy neighbor and breaking a part of my window For context, I live in a barangay in Manila. Barangays are the smallest administrative district in a Local Gov't Unit, and usually the oldest barangays have houses that are really close to each other, usually either separated by a firewall or just a couple of meters of clearance, in this case it's the latter. This is because the lot we had was divided into two, with a small path in the middle for both houses, neighbors are my relatives that we don't talk to much anymore. Lastly, I have jalousie windows.

I didn't have any issues with the noisy neighbors back then, but ever since the pandemic started, and I'm always in the house, specifically in my room, it has become really annoying. I'd wake up at 2-3am with my neighbor talking to someone on the phone and it's obnoxiously loud, aside from that there's his brother that does rants in the middle of the night like some child on a tantrum. It's as if there aren't any people sleeping. This was the case back in March 2020 up to now. 

This morning I had enough, I tried shouting indirectly about letting people sleep and how noisy it was, that
 didn't work, it's like he didn't hear anything. Then my dumbass self banged on one of the glass panes on the window, I didn't expect I'd hit it hard enough for it to break in the middle, with the shards falling to the path in the middle. The pathway was for the inner residences at the back of the lot, I was lucky too that it was early in the morning so there aren't any people passing by. That
 he did notice, and we had an argument. After I cooled off I calmly talked to him again to tell him to tone down when it's night time, he understood (hopefully). Patched up the hole in the window with a cintra board the size of the broken jalousie glass.

"TIFU by knocking a ceiling tile loose in class For context: (As of this post) I am a 16-year-old male in 10th grade, and I am TALL. Tallest in anything: my family, my classes, a volunteer group I’m part of etc. (I’m 6’5” last I checked but I’m sure I have grown since)

On with the story, this was the Friday before Christmas break and in my World History Class. Someone had brought their Nintendo Wii, and with it they brought Just Dance 3. After two other songs we decided to bust a groove to “Hit me Baby One More Time” by Britney Spears. At the end of the song, they have all four players jump up and....you can see where this is going. 😔

I make two fist, put them up high and jump, like I’m a red plumber who eats mushrooms, then POW!! I bash a ceiling tile out of place 

When I landed, I didn’t realize what happened until I saw everyone looking above me, prompting myself to look up and see what my tall, clumsy self had done. The teacher wasn’t furious, but still miffed that one his students had literally raised the roof. Thankfully, some Harry Potter-looking kid was able to get the ceiling tile back into place and I got off with a warning to just be careful.

"TIFU by slamming my door Ok well this happened in April, 2019, but I figured it belonged here. 

We moved into a new house in 2018. The old owners left a thick mirror on my door. One of the ones that don’t have a frame and don’t shatter, but instead breaks into large pieces. That information is relevant to the story.

So the night this happened, my grandmother and I had gotten into an argument. I had gotten pretty mad and stormed up to my room to calm down. I slammed my door very hard for a 5’2 teenage girl. I heard a crash and time slowed down. I saw the mirror break into countless pieces, including a few huge chunks of thick glass. One of those chunks of glass sliced through my left shin. I didn’t even feel it at first. I looked down and saw blood. All I saw was blood. 

I screamed and managed to run down the stairs with a hole in my leg (thank you, adrenaline). My brother and my grandmother both helped hold pressure on the wound while we waited for an ambulance to arrive. I didn’t feel any pain at all (again, thank you, adrenaline) and was just freaking out. 

The glass just barely missed my muscle, but cut the layer right above the muscle. Because of that, and my stupid fear of popping a stitch, I lost half my movement in my left ankle. My nerves are severely damaged. Every light touch anywhere near or below the scar (oh yea, I got 48 stitches btw) sends tingles shooting up my leg. Kind of feels like pins and needles, but it’s just in a line above wherever my leg got touched. You know when a limb gets tired? Yea, my leg does that randomly. And it sucks. I used to have great balance, but my balance has been completely thrown off by this. 

Do I regret slamming that door? Not really. Left me with a great story and a scar that caught my now boyfriend’s attention over a year ago. I just hate that I now get extremely nervous around broken glass now.

"TIFU by buying an f/4 camera lens as a brit To preface i'm a photographer who mostly uses a small pocket camera (Sony RX100) and a DSLR only for bigger jobs, i'm not a big fan of mirrorless.

Anyway, i was getting bored of using my RX100 and missed the large viewfinders, the battery life, and everything else that came with DSLR's, but my only DSLR was a Canon 1D IV which is way too big and heavy to carry around.

So my christmas gift to myself was the Canon 7D w/ EF 24-105 f/4L

I was a little skeptical of getting a lens with a maximum aperture of 4, my sony is 1.8, if you don't know what that means, f = l / D where l = focal length of lens and d = diameter of the front element of the lens, the lower the number, the more light the lens lets in.

But i realized i never really used f/1.8 on my RX100 unless it's really dark, i'm a pixel peeper with self-diagnosed OCD and the zeiss lens at 1.8 is a little soft, so i mostly used f/4-8.

So i opened the lens and camera on christmas day, the lens had some scuffs which knocked it down in value, the camera, some signs of use but very well looked after with low shutter count, both are fantastic.

The problem? I've been bringing the camera/lens out on essential days, but literally everyday it's been overcast and raining, and i'm forced to use a max aperture of f/4, the pictures either come out grainy due to high ISO or blurry, or underexposed, and i'm pretty sure i have some form of Seasonal affective disorder, which means i have no inspiration and have taken a few hundred photos, only a handful have actually been decent enough for my portfolio, the rest is blurry or just me testing it out.

I also overestimated the High ISO noise performance, my RX100 deals with noise fantastically and even then it's only nice monochromatic and there's still info in the shadows, the canon though, has horid chromatic noise, hot pixels and no info in the shadows.

On a bright sunny day it's a great combo, if i was one of those stereotypes living on the West Coast of the USA in Sunny CA, i'm sure i'd be getting some great pictures of my VW camper and the palm trees at the beach while cranking the vibrance up high for those cyan blue skies at shutter speeds of 1/2000 at f/8 with ISO 200.

But no, i'm a brit with typical british weather trying to get atleast a decent macro shot of a raindrop on a window at 1/30 of a second at ISO 12,800 hoping f/4 is good enough.

To make matters worse i bought myself a cheap ND filter set because i envisioned doing photography on a sunny day, they haven't seen a single bit of use yet.

I'm considering getting an EF 50mm f/1.8 STM 

TL;DR: I'm a photographer who was bored of shooting with a pocket camera so i bought a decent used DSLR and F/4 lens as my christmas gift, only to find out it doesn't let in enough light for overcast rainy british days, i have barely used it, and i'm considering buying a nifty fifty 1.8 or going back to using my pocket camera",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'buying', 'an', 'camera', 'lens', 'as', 'brit', 'to',

"TIFU by getting my grandma facebook Not today, 3 days ago my grandma who only got a smartphone for the first time this December 1st asked me to get her on Facebook because all her friends are on there.

So i do it in my stupid innocence. Well 2 have passed now and in just two days she leveled up from a 1 to a solid 5. In JUST 2 DAYS facebook has made her hate vaccines. Belive in the flat earth. Burn a picture of Jesus Christ, almost get me expelled from the Christian school i go to becuz she very nearly called the family friend nun principal to spew anti christ hate, hate muslims even more, belive covid is a government hoax, belive covid was started by china to take over india(how those 2 can go together idk) and thats just the beginning. Her facebook is showing no signs of stopping and idk how much worse it can get.

"TIFU by sticking two in the pink and one in the stink This happened last year when I was dating my ex. 

We had been seeing each other for a few months and started really exploring her sexuality. I knew mine. My fingers were massaging her insides when she asked me if I would put lube on my pinky and rub her butthole at the same time. She said her ex did it and she liked it. I lubed up and went back in.

"TIFU by not knowing that testicular torsion was not part of puberty Since everyone else is sharing their testicular torsion story, I would like to share mine as well. I had no idea how common this was.

The event happened back in 2012 when I was 16 years old, but the story starts years before that. Occasionally, in the middle of the night while sleeping, I would suddenly wake up from this excruciating pain (similar to how it feels when you get your balls kicked). The pain usually lasted for a minute or two, and I would just fall back asleep. This usually happened several nights per year, nothing major. I just thought to myself, “hey this is just part of puberty” as I was still in my early teens.

Fast forward to 2012, I noticed that these nights kept happening more and more often. I was starting to get worried, so I turned to Dr. Google, who usually had an answer for everything health-related. I forgot exactly what keywords I used to search it up, but it was something along the lines of “balls hurt at night” and “balls hurt in the middle of my sleep”. I guess these keywords of complaints weren’t enough for Dr. Google to know what the hell was going on, so I didn’t get an answer.

One day, while I was showering (getting ready to go to a birthday party), that pain suddenly came up. Only this time, it was much worse, and I was able to actually see what my balls looked like while this was happening. Imagine a pale, enlarged grape with veins running under its thin layer of skin. I yelled out for help, and my dad came rushing in (at this point, I didn’t care that I was naked).  He told me to dip my balls in warm water, so I did. The level of pain fluctuated, but the warm water wasn’t enough to make it go away. At this point, my mind was still set on going to that birthday party.

About 20 minutes later (now in my room, waiting for it to go away), the level of pain kicked it up a notch to the point where I was in agony, grabbing my bedsheets and ripping it to shreds. At this point, my dad decided that it was time to call 911. The ambulance came and picked me up. Funny thing was, I don’t remember them turning on their sirens on the way to the hospital. 

Doctor assessed my scrotum, and said it was testicular torsion. I had to go in for an emergency surgery. Next thing I knew, I was in a hospital bed and my family members all surrounding me. I went home the same day with stitches running across my left nut. Later that night, I called my friend saying sorry I missed his birthday. Didn’t give him the exact reason why. All I told him was that I had a health emergency.

TL;DR - Didn’t know that testicular torsion wasn’t part of puberty. Pain kept coming and going, but I ended up needing surgery and missing my friend’s birthday party.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'not', 'knowing', 'that', 'testicular', 'torsion', 'was', 'not', 'part', 'of',

All of my contacts with notifications on received a notification with: (realname), one of your contacts is on instagram as (instaname). My family, gf and her family probably all saw it.


The big problem here is that it is a really weird fetish account. If it was just a regular nsfw account i wouldn’t have a really big problem with it but this fetish is a really big secret of mine. Im not ready to accept this yet. Also this really will break the trust my girlfriend had because i never told her about this.

"TIFU by making the CEO of my job think I’m in a fight club. Yesterday, I had the misfortune of getting a massive black eye, the event of which can be read about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/krh86d/tifu_by_swan_diving_into_my_roommates_head/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) for the full story. Even more unfortunate than getting a huge black eye was the timing which happened to be the night before the most important presentation of my young career. 

Our story begins this morning when I woke up to find that only one of my eyes opened. A quick trip to the bathroom mirror found [this monstrosity](https://imgur.com/gallery/56mk3y1) looking back at me. After going back and forth and even asking on Reddit how I should approach the presentation given my stunning resemblance to Quasimodo, I decided that I should just own it and do my presentation without doing anything to cover my eye. So I finish getting ready for the big day and presentation then leave for work. 

The journey to work was interesting enough by itself as driving with one eye takes quite a bit of getting used to, but I manage to arrive in one piece. As I walk into the office, I’m immediately met with stares and could hear some hushed whispers among coworkers behind me as I walked by. I wasn’t long before word got passed to my boss who came to take a look at [the damage. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/fgzkad6) .  After the initial shock, he just kinda sighed and said the the CEO was “going to love looking at that for the next hour.”  So, that wasn’t a great start.

I gather my notes and computer and go to the conference room to prep for my presentation. As I’m getting the PowerPoint set up, in walks the CEO whom I’ve only ever seen in passing. There was an audible gasp when he saw my face, followed immediately by a “what the hell happened to you?”  I had decided earlier that I was just going to try to make jokes about my eye so I didn’t have to be so self conscious about it and responded that I was in a club, but I’m not supposed to talk about it, followed by a laugh. He didn’t laugh. 

I try to finish the conversation quickly as other people had started to file into the conference room and I began my presentation. Even though the first joke didn’t go well, I still tried to throw in a few jokes like “In this next slide, unlike me, you can see...” to a few polite chuckles from sympathetic coworkers. I finish the presentation and am thanked by my boss and the meeting was finished immediately after. 

A few minutes after I leave the conference room, my boss calls me into his office and tells me to shut the door. Uh oh. He begins by saying that he could see that I put a lot of work into my presentation, but he was very unimpressed with my “unprofessionalism”.  He said that he had had a conversation with the CEO who had serious concerns about me, apparently worried about a potential unsavory life outside of work and inability to be serious in a professional setting. I try to explain that I was only making jokes because I’m self conscious about my eye, but my boss refused to hear it. He told me I am getting a formal warning and that I am one more fuck up away from getting fired, before telling me to leave and go to a doctor to get my eye checked. To top off this wonderful day, the doctor told me it’ll be about a week to open my eye and about 4-6 weeks before I look normal again. Should be an interesting month.

"TIFU by giving my friend the wrong phone number **TL;DR: In 2017 I fucked up and lost a friend by giving him the wrong phone number. Only realized what happened last week.**

So to start this story I need to introduce a few characters. There's me (OP), Friend A, Friend B (all late-20s M) and my girlfriend (mid-20s F). One more key detail: my girlfriend's ex has the same first name as B. They had a rough breakup long before we met.

I've been friends with A since kindergarten. We met B in early high school and the 3 of us were a ""friend group"". We never really hung out with anyone else, just the three of us. We'd spend every day together in school and after graduating we still hung out every weekend. At one point we all had girlfriends and they'd hang out with us too, but at the time of this incident B and C were single.

A couple years post-high school, B started to feel like a third wheel in our group. Friend A and I had known each other a lot longer, had a few inside jokes, and never really hung out with B 1-on-1. It was either me and A together or all 3 of us. So B started coming around less and less over a couple months, and then we stopped seeing him all together.

I realized what was happening and made a conscious effort to be better friends with B. I talked to him more often, did more things with him 1-on-1, and simply tried to avoid any situation that made him feel excluded. This helped improve things and we were starting to hang out again.

One night in 2017, I was hanging out with Friend B to watch hockey and drink beer. He opened up to me for the first time and said that he was very happy about being included more and he was sorry about ghosting us for a while. He had a new phone and asked me to give him A's number so we could arrange for us to all hang out again soon.

This is where I fucked up. Nobody bothers to remember phone numbers any more. Besides my parents, the only numbers I know off by heart are for my girlfriend and Friend A. After a few beers, I got those two phone numbers mixed up. *I accidentally gave my girlfriend's number to B.* At some point over the next couple days, B texted my girlfriend (thinking it was A).

&gt;**Hey this is \[B\], I got a new number. We should definitely hang out some time soon. \[OP\] too.**

My girlfriend received this text out of the blue and thought it was from her ex, also named B. He had reached out a few times since we'd been dating and tried to get back with her, so this was a very strange and unwelcome message. She responded:

&gt;**No thanks. \[OP\] and I want nothing to do with you. Feel free to lose this number.**

Sounds a little harsh but not really when you know the history between my girlfriend and her ex, a guy who has tried several times to get back with her years later. She even told me about this at the time and I didn't piece it together. She said she got a text from her ex asking to hang out and I didn't question it.

I spoke to B a few more times in the coming weeks and he was clearly distant. He told me he didn't want to hang out with A and we only saw each other two or three more times before he basically cut all contact with both of us. I never heard about the text exchange from B, and obviously A never mentioned it because it wasn't him.

Fast forward 3+ years, and I'm hanging out with girlfriend going through old screenshots. She finds one of that text conversation and shows it to me. The second I see it I realize what happened. I have no idea why it clicked now and not before. That was last week, and I have since texted B and messaged him on fb but no response. I think what's done is done, and I ruined a friendship by giving out the wrong number.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'giving', 'my', 'friend', 'the', 'wrong', 'phone', 'number', 'tl', 'dr', 'in', '2017',

"TIFU by dropping my juul in the toilet 
God, I am so fucking embarrassed just writing this, but hopefully a few people get a laugh from it. 

To start off, I’m 20, still living with parents. Yes I know vaping is bad, I intend to quit. But I have a lot of other self destructive habits which are way worse than a nicotine addiction. Anyways. 

I was getting ready to hop in the shower earlier today, and I happened to leave the toilet lid open. I took a few hits off the vape, as you do. I was butt naked, the floor was wet, and suddenly I was on my ass, cheeks against the tile floor, and I heard a splash. *My. Heart. **DROPPED***. 

Luckily the toilet hadn’t been used recently, so the water was “clean”. Lo and behold, at the bottom of the bowl, my Blue Razz Lio disposable vape pen shimmered in the water. 

I panicked. If I flushed the vape, it would 100% clog the toilet, and I’d have to explain why a nicotine device was lodged in the pipe. I am not a man who can face his mistakes. So I did what any reasonable person would do. 

I found a Walmart bag in the cupboard, put it over my hand like I was about to pick up dog poo, and plunged my hand into the toilet. Big. Fucking. Mistake. In my panic, I neglected to check the bag for any holes. By god, I sure did find them quick. 

Let me paint a picture of my situation: I’m ass naked, shoulder deep in my toilet bowl with a grocery bag wrapped around my fist like some kind of ghetto surgical glove, reaching desperately into the pipe to retrieve a vape device. My dick is pressed against the cold ceramic of the toilet, and my eyes are watering. 

I finally grab it. The evasive blue razz vape slides into my hand. I then make my next critical mistake. In my haste to remove my hand from the toilet water, I jerk my hand up, splashing myself in the face with toilet water. I don’t even care. My pride has been stripped from me. 

I wrap the vape in ten layers of toilet paper and dispose of it in the trash can. Fucking toilets, man.

TL;DR: fisted my toilet bowl to retrieve my stupid vape so it didn’t clog the pipe, wound up with toilet water on my hands and face",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'dropping', 'my', 'juul', 'in', 'the', 'toilet',

"TIFU by using a hairdryer to clear my swimmer’s ear 5 years ago, while on my honeymoon, my wife and I went on a snorkeling/booze cruise and I managed to get a fair amount of water in my ear. (half drunk on rum and snorkeling…go figure) In my drunken stupor I alternated between using a hairdryer and cue tips to attempt to relieve the pressure but eventually gave up and went to bed.  The next day the pressure was not nearly as bad, but a faint case of tinnitus came in its place. Assuming that I did some sort of slight permanent damage and not wanting to ruin the rest of the honeymoon, I tried to put it behind me and continued on my way.  
Fast-forward to last week, the tinnitus never went away, and I have avoided getting my ears wet at all due to them clogging at the slightest sign of pressure.  One afternoon, I was scrolling aimlessly on my phone and received a targeted ad for some ear canal camera/ear cleaner device and figured… sure why not. The camera showed up yesterday and my mind was blown to see the solid wall of yellow/ green earwax staring right back at me. 
Shocked, confused, and pretty grossed out, I was able to get an appointment at the Drs office for this morning and after the nurse soaking my ear canal in hydrogen peroxide for 20 minutes and pressure washed with warm water, she was met with a tsunami of rust colored ear wax.
Five years later, I have no sign of the tinnitus, and can finally hear clearly from my left ear.  

Tldr: I’m a dope and melted earwax to my eardrum …then waited five years to have it looked at.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'using', 'hairdryer', 'to', 'clear', 'my', 'swimmer’s', 'ear', 'years', 'ago',

"TIFU by causing my iphone 7 plus to get loop disease This happened a year ago but what happened was I was showing off my iphone 7 plus to my friend which his name is bob(false name) with a nice huge protective case my mom bought for it and with a decent screen protector to show the power of how protective it was I literally SLAMMED the phone on a concrete floor. No outside damage meaning screen and back is perfect showed it and then we went to math class where before I turned off my phone. After math class I turned it on took forever to boot which is a symptom of loop disease. Then later on I found out the mic has died on the phone and the calling has also died too. Though ios updates did fix one of the problems where it can finally turn on quicker and bluetooth headphones would let the phone be able to call again but you need to put on the headphones everytime someone called you. I later sold the phone for 70 bucks.

"Our 14yo is giving us the silent treatment ever since he caught me and his mother fucking 10 years ago, my ex-wife went through a mid-life crisis after realizing she wasn't ""hot"" like she was when she was in her 20s. She ended up cheating on me with some 20yo college kid and we divorced. The divorce wasn't hostile and we remained friendly and good co-parents. I had been with her for 15 years before our divorce.

We started to spend more ""family"" time with our two sons a few years ago. Just stuff like dinner or a ball game. Real friendly. Neither my ex nor me had a serious relationship with anyone since.

We started having our own relationship outside of the kids and started fucking when the kids were at school (we work and live near by). Just like good old times. Sometimes twice a day. We stopped with our 14yo doing remote learning. Our 19yo is never really home.

Last week, my ex came over for sex while our 14yo was remote learning at her house. It was some really good sex. All of a sudden I see someone walking by my window and it's my son.

We all saw each other. He had forgot a book at my house and walked over to pick it up. I was actually about to nut when we saw us.

My ex told him we were ""working out"" and all my son said was ""okay."" Usually he's a talkative kid, but he's been dean silent to both of us. He's probably very confused and wondering if we are going to get back together (which we're not).",0,"['our', '14yo', 'is', 'giving', 'us', 'the', 'silent', 'treatment', 'ever', 'since', 'he',

"TIFU by joking about google translate Username checks out.

Today I matched with several people on dating apps, which is a huge turn around for me. I even had conversations going and everything felt like it was going alright.

One of the people I matched with does not speak English as a first language and is learning with the help of translator apps. I'm going to keep this intentionally vague as I've never felt confortable sharing anything private that isn't solely about me online.This only came up because they brought it up, as I am not the type of idiot white person (language and race are not the same but if I had to guess the race aspect only makes this worse) to fetishize that type of shit.

Or so I thought. A couple messages in I joked about playing a game of telephone with google translate (dumb af but I was trying to keep it lighthearted) with a translated message. Immediate unmatch.

I thought it just went with the subject but clearly it came off that other way I didn't intend. Which after a few minutes of thinking makes sense, they brought that up to explain something and it might have come off as me poking fun, if not that trash racist shit. I'm an idiot and since I can't apologize I can only confess my sin into the void.

"TIFU by reheating taco bell in my oven and nearly setting my apartment building ablaze, while blazed. I finished work late and decided to pickup some taco bell on the way home because I am a garbage person and didn't want to cook.  I got stuck in traffic and it started to cool down, so I decided I would reheat it when I got home..  (hot garbage is best garbage)

I chucked it in a cold oven on the lowest setting and went outside for a jazz-cigarette. (hot garbage is even better when you're jazzed up)

I returned to an apartment smelling of delicious hot taco bell.

I excitedly opened the oven and flames and smoke erupted from it.

I immediately close the oven and turn it off.  I'm high.  My brains racing (as fast as it can) to solve this problem.

I fill up a water jug, open the oven, toss it in to douse the flames and shut the oven again.

The fire is now out, but now my apartment is filled with hot acidic smoke/steam.  Truly, hot garbage.

The building fire alarm turns starts.

Panic intensifies.  I'm about to have to explain (while high) to a firemen in front of all of my fellow residents how I'd just sent my taco bell on fire, but there is no fire anymore and everyone can go home.

I quickly open the windows, put my central heating on max fan to try to cycle some air out of my room and spend a quick minute hastily trying to clean up the evidence of my shameful mistake.

I start to head down the hallway with other residents, trying to play it cool like I don't know what's going on either.

MERCIFULLY the alarm stops before I make it to the elevator and I'm able to return to my now acrid apartment and deal with my mess in peace.  Fortunately my bedroom door was shut the whole time, so I only needed to wipe down every surface and mop the floor and leave the windows open all night.

TLDR: I tried to reheat taco bell in the oven, set fire to it, had to deal with the aftermath while high, and narrowly avoided any damage or embarrassment.

P.S. I think that one of the wrappers must have unwrapped in the heat and touched one of the elements.. I still can't work out how on earth a fire could have started otherwise, the food was barely warm.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'reheating', 'taco', 'bell', 'in', 'my', 'oven', 'and', 'nearly', 'setting', 'my',

"TIFU by attempting to shovel driveways. It's winter. I live in a cold country, we get a lot of snow. I thought I would be the good guy and shovel drives and salt them for the neighbors. On my second drive however, a thought occurred. I'd drank coffee that morning, and was drinking one from a flask. Coffee is a very strong laxative for me.

I was stood, in my neighbors drive as the feeling hit, it wasn't stopping, time to mkve. I began to run, not thinking about the ice, and ended up slipping in their drive. The shock from falling made me lose focus, and I let loose. It ended up coming up and out of my pants from the impact of hitting the ground, leaving a mess in the drive.

I waddled home and showered, before cleaning their drive and giving up. 

I have since received kind words from various neighbours, which is ridiculously embarrassing as I think they seen it happen. At least they'll know to clear their own drives now.

"Tifu by watching Vivarium with my kids. My kids are boy 11 and girl 13.
This happened last night. We started the evening by watching The Hobbit, but we had to cut it short because it kept buffering, so we switched to Netflix and voted on Vivarium, a 13+ thriller. It looked innocent enough, 
It is a weird film and after watching we agreed on it being creepy weird film and nothing more to say about that. 

Well now, time for bed, but both the kids couldn't get settled they felt uneasy.
 time past and the uneasiness turned to fear and although I promised to sit up till they fell asleep with lights on, it didn't work, so around 5 this morning, we where 3 huddled together in the living room,on the sofa bed, my not so small kids sleeping on top of me, like they dit when they where two year olds, and me cursing myself for not figuring out that the weirdness and the creepiness of that film was worse than the splatter of the Hobbit.
So you could say that the film was good, it scared the hell out of my children.

"TIFU By leaving my oven on So, this actually happened 2 nights ago, but here it is. 

Some background you should know is that I live in a pretty old house with really old appliances. That being said, My oven has no vent hood, and will warm the entire kitchen up when we use it. I even have to set the temperature to 50 degrees lower than whatever the instructions say because it isn't calibrated properly. Its a pain in the ass but we cant afford a new oven so we work around it. Above my oven sits some shelves that contain various cooking supplies. Oh, its also note worthy that it is a gas powered oven/stove.  


On with my fuck up; I decided to make some apple crisp for my husband, his brother and I, so I did. I guess I forgot to turn the oven off because at some point in the wee hours of the morning (somewhere around 2:30-3 am HOURS after I had made the crisp) my brother in law said he heard the loud sound of a glass bottle breaking.  He walked into the kitchen to inspect and saw that the heat from the oven rose into the cabinet above, where my husband had put a brand new bottle of olive oil. This oil heated up, expanded, and then made the bottle explode causing a MASSIVE mess of olive oil that was headed straight for down inside my stove and oven....where there were LIT pilot lights. If my brother in law hadn't been awake, I'm pretty sure my house would have burnt to the ground with us inside. He even said he tried to come wake us and we didn't hear a thing.

"I feel like I was a peeping Tom when I was younger, but I’ve been having trouble remembering and it’s causing me distress. There were a couple of situations around my teenager years where I did creepy things and I’ve been feeling dreadful about them. One that I think I remember was from a New Years party when I was around 17, I remember a guy accidentally walked in on a girl using the bathroom, and I remember seeing it. Admittedly my memory isn’t the best but I can’t remember if I was walking by when this happened or if I came over to take a look. 

The other situation that happened, I don’t even remember when, it could have been when I was 17, 18 or 19 but it was when my sibling’s ex was going to take a shower, I remember her walking around the house naked, when she went into the bathroom I remember my mother asking me to bring a towel to my sibling’s ex at the bathroom door and I remember being kind of excited because I knew she was naked. My mother decided to bring it to her instead because she knew she wasn’t decent. This was another scenario when I can’t remember my intentions, I vaguely remember walking by the bathroom door and my sibling’s ex having the door near shit to grab the towel, but I can’t remember if I was just casually going by the door to get something or I tried to take a peak, I never ended up seeing anything.

I’m 21 now and know these days how wrong doing that sort of stuff is but even with the chance that I’ve done these creepy things make me feel disgusted at myself, I’ve been having trouble remembering all the details which has only been making my anxiety worse. These days I’d never want to be some creep who causes others discomfort for my own pleasure but the idea that I may have done so when I was younger makes me feel like I’ve thrown my life away and

"TIFU by mentioning Terry a. Davis in class Little bit of context, Computer science student at Roman Catholic Boys School, my teacher is about 40-50ish well anyways today she asked us if we knew any programmers so me in my infinite wisdom said Terry a. Davis (a racist programmer for those who don't know), I immediately realised what I had done and started to panic, she said ""I've never heard of him, who is he"" and I frantically tried to explain, seeing I was doing a bad job she decided to open up Chrome and just look him up. Well the video ""Terry a. Davis gets a phonecall"" comes up and she clicks it. About 30ish seconds in he says ""I'm not a ni----, I wrote my own compiler"" it took her 5 seconds to realise but it was too late, she closed the tab extremely quickly and called me out and said ""Did you know he was a racist?""

"TIFU by trying to sucking my husbands thumb sexily So today has been a long stressful day between kids, life, pandemic, and all the stuff in between, so we decided to leave the phones, pack the kids up, and go get some fast food. It's a nice thing for them since they dont go out anymore and well, fast food. So after picking up some chicken nuggets and fries we was finally making it back home. Now its important to state our daughters, 6&amp;7, was in the first row in the back seats. So here is my chunky ass happily listening to the music, eating some fries, excited to finally get back home at which point my husband starts putting his thumb in my face back and fourth so, naturally, I thought he wanted a fry. I got one for him and he just shook his head no and started putting his thumb in my face again at which point the only thing that came to me in that moment was that 'oh he wants me to suck his thumb for suggestive purposes for later'. Don't ask why or how I got to that conclusion since nothing in that situation even remotely gave that hint, but I went for it at which point, as I'm just about to close my mouth, he moves his hand back trying to figure out what the hell was just about to happen and, at the same time, I realize that the reason he had his thumb there was to show me that the girls was dancing to the music and now, since they decide in that very second to pay attention to anything around them, I have both of them asking why I was about to bite dad's thumb and he hasn't stopped making jokes since.

"Generally speaking, I don't care for any opinion from women Maybe it's because I'm gay and pussy doesn't influence me, but I find the vast majority of stupid opinions come from women. Women tend to be very egocentric which clouds their opinions. They try to make everything about them when it has nothing to do about them. Very little of what comes out of their mouths is interesting, thought-provoking or intelligent. It's just noise. So, yes, that is why women have to work harder than men to be accepted on the same level with men.",0,"['generally', 'speaking', ""don't"", 'care', 'for', 'any', 'opinion', 'from', 'women', 'maybe', ""it's"", 'because', ""i'm"", 'gay', 'and', 'pussy', ""doesn't"", 'influence', 'me', 'but', 'find', 'the', 'vast', 'majority', 'of', 'stupid', 'opinions', 'come', 'from', 'women', 'women', 'tend', 'to', 'be', 'very', 'egocentric', 'which', 'clouds', 'their', 'opinions', 'they', 'try', 'to', 'make', 'everything', 'about', 'them', 'when', 'it', 'has', 'nothing', 'to', 'do', 'about', 'them', 'very', 'little', 'of', 'what', 'comes', 'out', 'of', 'their', 'mouths', 'is', 'interesting', 'thought', 'provoking', 'or', 'intelligent', ""it's"", 'just', 'noise', 'so', 'yes', 'that', 'is', 'why', 'women', 'have', 'to', 'work', 'harder', 'than', 'men', 'to', 'be', 'accepted', 'on', 'the', 'same', 'level', 'with', 'men']",generally speaking don't care for any opinion from women maybe it's because i'm gay and pussy doesn't influence me but find the vast majority of stupid opinions come from women women tend to be very egocentric which clouds their opinions they try to make everything about them when it has nothing to do about them very little of what comes out of their mouths is interesting thought provoking or intelligent it's just noise so yes that is why women have to work harder than men to be accepted on the same level with men,generally speaking don't care for any opinion from woman maybe it's because i'm gay and pussy doesn't influence me but find the vast majority of stupid opinion come from woman woman tend to be very egocentric which cloud their opinion they try to make everything about them when it ha nothing to do about them very little of what come out of their mouth is interesting thought provoking or intelligent it's just noise so yes that is why woman have to work harder than men to be accepted on the same level with men,gener speak don't care for ani opinion from women mayb it' becaus i'm gay and pussi doesn't influenc me but find the vast major of stupid opinion come from women women tend to be veri egocentr which cloud their opinion they tri to make everyth about them when it ha noth to do about them veri littl of what come out of their mouth is interest thought provok or intellig it' just nois so ye that is whi women have to work harder than men to be accept on the same level with men
"TIFU by sending extremely passive aggressive messages to my sister after she left for college without saying bye. Ok so some context. This happened hours ago, my sister's Winter break is over so she went back to college today right? Well I helped her with her stuff and then said I was gonna use the bathroom, expecting to see her outside and say goodbye to her. My mom texts me saying she parked across the street and I go out only to see she isn't there.

So I get in the car and we wait. Turns out according to mom she came down and didn't come out. Mind you, she has a boyfriend who she obviously gives all her attention to (no joke she talks to him 24/7 but not to us) and up and left. Me, my mom, and my stepdad, we were all upset at her.

Later on, come nightfall it was dinner time and I got too pissed and messaged her an extremely passive aggressive message. I sent:

""Heyo (sister's name), just wanna let you know we're all upset that you didn't say bye to us and just ghosted us cuz of your boyfriend but y'know it's whatever! I hope your phone actually ""works"" this time with us and not just with your boyfriend!😃😄""

Yeah, big mistake. She got ticked and I went back and forth saying ""Riiiight but I bet if it was (sister's boyfriend's name) you would've received it huh?"" (This was after I told her mom did call her and she ignored us... again.)

This lead to me sending a screenshot as evidence of the fact that mom DID call her saying ""Bullshit! You didn't call us but mom did!""

Side note, I'm 14, she is 21. I rarely curse to her (only when I quote some dumb meme or a thing my friend said). I have NEVER cursed at her in spite. Today was the first.

Of course, she got upset, and said not to curse at her (although, if I'm extremely upset at you and I feel it's appropriate obviously I'll curse. I won't give people respect if they do something like that. Especially if they're a family member).

She then claimed she was in her room thinking I'd come back (mom and I had a feeling she'd say that) and then I said ""Mom and I had a feeling you were gonna pull the ""I was in my room"" card.""

And things sorta went from there, with my last message to her being ""But ya know it iz what it izzz! Right?😃""

Later on mom got a call from sis's boyfriend and sis was on the line. I overheard it all. She was crying and when mom put me on the phone to talk to her sis said (without me knowing I was on the line) in her tearful voice: ""I don't want to talk to her right now.""

**That hurt. Really badly. I somehow made my 21 year old sister cry. And I felt so terrible. I still do. I couldn't eat the rest of my dinner.**

And here I am! 12:33 AM and typing away all of this and fuck I feel terrible. She's gonna call this weekend supposedly but eh I dunno.

"TIFU- I sent my mom nudes on accident. That were supposed to go to a client. And she has no idea I’m an adult cam model. ROYALLY! FUCK! ME! 
Yyyyeeeeeaaaahhhhh. I’ve been sitting here, blankly staring at my phone for the last two hours. So, my soul has abandoned ship and left me here completely alone... you know, my self conscious?... the illogical one? Yeah, I’m really emotional and I act out drastically based on my fear! Soul is the one who talks me down from doing anything crazy that’s always that REALLY COOL “don’t do anything I wouldn’t do” aunt Aimee at the New Years party when she sees you sneaking outside with your friends or significant other..... conscious? Me? I’m the Uncle Tom at the 4th of July cookouts that wears open toed leather sandals, eats trail mix, partially receding hairline, slight-pony tail and a massive beer gut hanging out of my unbuttoned and completely open “god bless the USA” t-shirt. I just don’t GIVE a fuck - I’m a complete mess and I couldn’t ever quite possibly manage to embarrass myself any more than I have already done on my own! It’s just NOT humanly possible!

OK anyways, back to what I was saying. 
I. Am. Fucking. EMBARRASSED! How to do I explain this? 
“Sorry mom, I meant to send that to....” 
..... “sorry mom! I didn’t mean to take that photo! Wow Idk how it sent to you too!! Oops!”
🥲😱😭🤭
Yeah, I’m an adult. I’m 26, live in my own home, I’m engaged.... but that doesn’t outweigh the fav that my entire life I’ve always been the angel child, prude NUN in my moms eyes..... BUT NOW she knows then deep dark secret that I’m low key a god damn NYMPHO!
How am I going to even face my mother? WTF AM I GOING TO SAY! HELP.... I’m supposed to mare her Monday, I can just IMAGINE getting out of the car, stopping like a deer in headlights.... 


me, in my head:  *WARNING!! WARNING!! PLEASE ABORT MISSION IMMEDIATELY!!*

*whispers a sharp “nope” before spinning on my toes, turning around, TAKING OFF AS I’M A 5-YEAR-STRAIGHT-UNDEFEATED-OLYMPIC-MEDAL-WINNING-ATHLETE WHO IS PARTAKING IN A MARATHON..... RIGHT THE GAHT-DAMN BACK to my car and LEAVING AS FAST AS I POSSIBLY CAN!!!!!.... 

TL;DR
Totally asked her “is this normal?” And acted like I was asking about a mark on my body.

"TIFU By Taking Opiods and Almosy Dying Obligatory this wasn't very recent. More like a year and a half at this point. I'm no longer in this headspace, but I've never really thought about this until now. 

Exactly two years ago today, my dad was diagnosed with a very rare and aggressive cancer of the duodenum. It was rapid, within 3 months he went from completely normal, to me giving the go ahead along with my brother for the DNR after he was intubated in the ICU. 

Everything went so fast, I feel like I got whiplash from it all. But anyway, my dad was prescribed very intense opiod painkillers. Stuff that only people in end of life care could get, specifically because he was a cancer patient. He was prescribed a variety of pain killing medication because od how intense his cancer was, and almost none of them worked. He was addicted the opiods, but they only ever offered a moments respite, before he was shouting in pain again.

It was very painful, not knowing what to do.  When he passed away we had more than a pharamcies worth of the stuff. I don't even remember the dosage, but I believe it was around 4 mg of fentanyl for the pills, which had absolutely no effect on him. Eventually he got the patches, but those caused their own set of problems so we discarded them for the less effective, but more accessible pills. At least when he wasn't in admittance at a hospital, which was very rare because of his pain

Every year, for as long as I remember, I get cluster headaches for a certain period of the year, which just so happened to conveniently be around the time he passed away, and the dust was starting to settle. Me, and my bright idea was to take one of these pills, with absolutely no tolerance to opiods, knowing and seeing, first hand, what opiod addiction can do to a person, because I just couldn't stand the headaches that day.  When I took it, I felt fine. But I felt very drowsey soon after, I slept for almost 14 hours after taking it. I didn't even realize I could have died from an overdose.

Pretty soon after, I  looked up the proper procedures to disposing of the fentanyl, and washed my hands completely of the stuff. I really wanted nothing to do with it, but looking back I could have easily died from what I did. 


TLDR: Took my dad's opiods like a dumbass and went to sleep for 14 hours. I could have died but luckily I woke up and got rid of the stuff.

"TIFU cooking naked So like any girlfriend, I decided to make my boyfriend breakfast. It’s both of our day off and thought I’d do something special. I’m making us eggs Benny with hash browns! Who wouldn’t want that!? And especially being served naked! Win win in my boys case. I didn’t tell him I was making breakfast because I wanted it to be a lil surprise! He’s gaming in the other room. 

He washed the dishes earlier this morning and while the hash browns were cooking I thought I smelt soap cooking, this pans on the top right and the eggs in the bottom left (two biggest burners) so I leaned in to smell the “soap” forgetting I’m 5’3 and can’t actually reach over something, I feel the heat, the pain. “FUCK” my boyfriend hears from the other room. Not only did I ruin the surprise but I SIZZLED MY NIP. I also broke the egg yolk with my fucking nipple. I’m sad and hurt and he’s laughing his ass off and then thanked me with a nipple kiss and left smh. He said it was amazing so no regrets.

"I'm starting to resent my partner because he's not an animal person. I recently combined households with my partner. Before we moved in together I had a dog with my roommate/best friend. Our dog loved both of us, so when I met a man who I adored I left the puppers with my friend so I could start a new chapter in my life. My partner is not an animal person but I honestly thought I could change that. 

I thought maybe if he saw how much I loved dogs and how happy they made me that he would give in and let me adopt a doggo. I've cried to him, I've begged and pushed. Everything except get angry because I knew all of this before we moved in together. All to no avail.

"TIFU by getting my relatives drunk. So this is my first Reddit post. I remembered this story and thought that this would be the best place to share it.

I’m using mobile, so sorry for typos etc.

We had some relatives around for Christmas when I was 12. I didn’t really know them very well but knew that they were highly religious. They were devout Salvationists. 12 year old me didn’t know much about this denomination of Christianity. I assumed that they would have similar beliefs to others. My mum said before they arrived that they can’t have a drop of alcohol as it was against their beliefs. 

So we sat around the dining room table and had some dinner. I minded my p’s and q’s and tried to be very polite and well mannered. 

After dinner my mum asked me to get some trifle for everyone. (This is where I messed up) I made the trifles earlier in the day and they looked pretty much the same. The only difference between them was that one had half a bottle of Sherry in it.  I grabbed the first one without thinking and served up several large helpings and gave it out. Everyone raved about how lovely it tasted. I was thanked for making it and continued on my day without thinking much more about it. 

I went to my room for a while and then went back to see my family.  Well... you could certainly tell that my visiting relatives were pissed as skunks! They were slurring their words and singing jollily. My mum took me to one side and asked which trifle I’d served up. I told her it was the one in front. I’d given them the one with all of the booze in!

They all had terrible hangovers after and I’m probably going to burn for it.

Only after keeping myself away from the public for a while would I try and hang out with my friend, he would always say no; however, he would hang out regularly with other people. I didn't get too upset because I didn't really care.  


I've been exposed to the virus multiple times, and went to this friend for comfort. He passed it off without second thought. I was scared of dying, but he just didn't care. His girlfriend got exposed to it and he freaked. 

He's told be how close that we are, we've known each other for over ten years, yet he didn't care about me. I'll admit that when I get sick I'm out of commission. 9th grade year of high school, I lost my voice multiple times because of me getting sick so often. 

I know that I'm on a lower level than his girlfriend, but it honestly upsets me greatly that he hasn't cared. I shouldn't care about how he feels, but we've been friends for so long. I don't know, I just needed to put this out there.

"TIFU by doing 100 squats after not exercising for a year. Thats it. Just read the title and you know exactly what i did.

I am a stupid 16yo that did nothing but sit on their thin ass on their desktop all year because covid. I have little to no muscles and i'm weak as hell. 

One of my friends was talking about exercises and how he couldn't get to 100 squats. He said he was too old for it. So my dumbass decided to do 100 squats at once to spite him. Now, i was always great at endurance, but this time it hit different. I also went for a 1 minute long squat for the 20th and the 100th.

When i finished my legs felt nearly dead and my heart beat harder than ever before. I tried to walk afterwards and every once in a while one of my legs would lose some strenght and bend, though i didn't fall.

I am complely fine now but i'm afraid of going to sleep. This is going to hurt like fuck when i wake up. DOMS is no joke. I'll update this post in a few hours after i am done sleeping.

I never squatted before this day btw.

TL;DR : My friend said he couldn't do 100 squats so i decided to go and do it despite not exercising for a year.

"TIFU by poisoning my own cup of tea First ever post on reddit, previously a serial scroller but I’m wired with nothing else to do so here we go.

For context I’m caffeine intolerant, so if I have caffeine I get all the usual effects but 1000 times stronger...

Tonight before bed I made one of those sleepy, knock you out for good, herbal teas. My housemate had actually been gifted a box of very fancy french tea bags. I picked one called ‘1001 Nuits’, the last time I spoke french was in high school on my french speaking exam. Even then I’d hidden a cheat sheet in my calculator but I still trusted my language intuition enough to be sure this meant ‘1001 Nights’, it actually smelt like rose and jasmine too which are usual suspects. So now I’m very excited to pass out with the power of 1001 nights worth of sleep so I brewed up and went to bed.

Now.. it’s 8 hours later I have the most intense headache, whilst being more awake than Flash Gordon on speed, plus the knowing dread that I have to deal with two blocked toilets in the morning. If tomorrow I mention being tired and some parent echoes in the distance ‘tired? You don’t know the meaning of tired till you’ve had kids’, I will take these bags from under my eyes and floor them.

But how could this have happened when I had the power of 1001 nights gently lulling me to sleep? Well after a quick, yet delayed, Google search it turns out Nuit is actually a region in France specialising in red wine, and stronger than Mike Tyson black tea. Can’t help but feel this is directly related to me not listening in French class, désolée Madame Robins.

"Tifu by throwing up on my dog during a walk TIFU:Okay so this happened around 4 years ago, but I'm telling it now. So this story starts off with me getting back from the gym with my father. At this time I'm heavily into training and working out, so any kid at my age would try to stuff as much food in there mouth as possible, because eat big, get big right. So when I get back from the gym I made a protein shake with 3 cups of milk, 4 bananas, scope of whey and a hand full of almonds. So to any rational person that's to much food, but to a ego driven teen it was hardcore and cool. So later in the evening my dad said we have to walk the dog. So I get ready and I start walking the dog with my dad, but I also have the huge urge to throw up. Half way through the walk I can't handle the sickness so bend over and start throwing up off the sidewalk into a patch of tall grass. (Side note my dog is attached to a retractable leash). Then my runs under my nose and yeah I bet you know the rest. My dad ended calling stupid and a moron after I told him about what I consumed around 45 minutes earlier. I learned 2 things that day. Don't over stuff your self to the point of sickness and don't use retractable leash. TL;DR made a protein shake with to many ingredients. Went to walk the dog. Threw up on the dog.

"I really want to kill my mother. I hate her, she is an overly emotional, manipulative piece of shit.

I can't stand the sight of her, her voice and her pathetic existence.

She has never cared for my emotions or who I am as a person for instance if I were to tell her I'm not religious or I might be bi, she would kick me out of the house.

Every fucking time I say I'm depressed, I need medication, a therapist, she just tells me to pray and god will heal me.

This stupidity has honestly made me more hostile towards religious people, I know it's not right tho and I'm trying to fix it.

Whenever I have a problem she brushes it off but when she has one it's like the world is ending and she's so damn dramatic.

Overly emotional who can't have a philosophical or logical argument because she'll end up crying.

I've tried to stop engaging with her, I don't hug her, I don't say hi basically I don't acknowledge her existence unless it's something important.

But guess what even that doesn't work because then I end up with the silent treatment where I'm forced to apologise.

I've had thoughts of slitting her throat, setting her on fire and all while laughing hysterically doing it, I'd just love to see her in pain.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still a teen and am trying my best to save up money so I can move out in two years.

Hopefully I can bear this burden before I do something horrid.",0,"['really', 'want', 'to', 'kill', 'my', 'mother', 'hate', 'her', 'she', 'is', 'an', 'overly', 'emotional', 'manipulative', 'piece',

"TIFU by Going to the Bathroom Before Leaving Home I've finally recovered from this enough to talk about it. NSFW to be safe. So obligatory not today, but a few weeks ago to about a month ago, I had my usual shark week. I've been really good about changing products related to that time of the month. But I've also taken up smoking weed during quarantine. And every friday night, my mom and her siblings all play poker together and I usually join them.

Normal friday night and shark week. I 'garden' a little while I'm getting ready, achieving a nice calm. Poker games had been getting tense lately - as of typing this it's been a few weeks since I've played because of the toxic environment - and I was getting stressed and I swear, period cramps are so much better when you're high. So it gets time to leave home, I use the bathroom because I hate changing my tampon outside the house. Guess what I forget to do?

My ass of dumbness did not replace the tampon. I remembered to take the old one out. I freebled on accident for at least five hours. I was wearing new pants (leggings), just bought them that week (I washed prior to wearing, covid paranoid) and yes, I got blood on them.

Good news is, I don't think I bled on anything other than my pants and underwear as the passagner's seat of my mom's van has no stains from this. I did feel wet at some point, I was not that high and by the time I'd arrived at my uncle's, I was not high, but I thought it was from me sitting on the ground outside after I was out of the game and waiting for my mom to be ready to drive me home (she was still playing). 

I laughed about it when I discovered it and told myself no more 'medication' before using the bathroom, have since gone to the bathroom high but have not made that mistake again. But I have checked a few times to make damn sure I remembered to replace the blood containment device. I did not ruin my pants, luckily. I honestly could not point out which pair they were now as I don't completely remember and there is absolutely no evidence anything that can bleed wore them but I have worn them several times since but RIP that pair of underwear, they were ruined before but they look worse now but I don't care about the panties. My pants weren't ruined, that's the important part.

TL;DR, I tried to change my tampon while high, only succeeded in removal and freebled in new leggings. I managed to get the blood out of the leggings.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'going', 'to', 'the', 'bathroom', 'before', 'leaving', 'home', ""i've"", 'finally', 'recovered', 'from', 'this', 'enough', 'to',

"Waiting for a train to fall from the sky and crush me I would like to start by telling you I am not suicidal. Don't bother sending weird articles or positive crap, I don't care. Save it for someone who actually needs it.

I have always been the happy, inclusive,  positive, pillar of the community kind of person if you asked anyone that has ever met me. One person I managed to ACTUALLY feel for, with the exception of the small people we created. But I have gone through a bunch of nasty shit in my life. Not looking to measure dicks, sure people have had it worse. I have held one of my children as she died in a hospital. My longest best friend ""died"", she went into a comma after an accident and came out a vastly different person. My partner, the only person since I lost that friend that I have truly, deeply connected with decided to betray that trust. Lots of depression and all that happy horse shit. 

Yea so now I honestly have 0 drive to live, but no real desire to attempt to end it. If anything there is a small dark voice that tells me to keep going regardless. Out of spite I guess. 

I feel so chaotic internally. I still pretend and send out all the positive vibes and kindness but I really just don't feel anything from it. Just doing it so no one really sees anything and I can just keep existing as a cog in the wheel, doing my normal daily shit. No real point in posting but I was hoping it would do something.

"TIFU by having too good acting skills as a kid This was many years ago and it's kind of fuzzy now but here goes.

I was at this summer camp and the councellors decided we would put on a play. It involved the wolf and the three pigs fable. But this play was unique because it was a play within a play. I was given the acting role of ""director"" in which my job was to randomly stop the play at intervals, shout at the characters about their lines, and change the scenery with a wave of my hand. Idk it was super weird but that's what it was.

They gave out notebooks with lines to everyone and it was our first read through. So I was getting to a part in the script where it was my turn to speak and ""be evil"". And so I went with it, insulting the wolf and three pigs, as per the script. I perhaps did it too convincingly. I remember getting death stares from the councellor watching backstage, and being confused because I was just reading my lines. She dragged me off the stage later and raged at me about manners and how I needed to control my temper. I was barred from participating in the play, and barred from participating in other camp activities afterwards.

I was a quiet kid and I was too freaked out by getting in trouble that I never admitted that I was actually just speaking lines the whole time, and that I had mistakenly read the script out loud from the wrong page, when everyone least expected it.

TLDR: Was in a play and was given a script. I mistakenly read my lines out loud from the wrong page. Convinced everyone I was talking for reals, and a total asshole. Got kicked out for being rude. Was too scared to admit I was actually just reading lines the entire time.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'having', 'too', 'good', 'acting', 'skills', 'as', 'kid', 'this', 'was', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'and',

"TIFU by drinking too much water in my newfound sobriety This actually happened last week, but the shame has finally subsided and I feel like I can tell this story. I recently became sober which has been rough, but I've been trying to use it as an opportunity to drink more water. I am also a chronic kidney stone producer and had like 6 stones in September, so I've taken that as a sign to drink as much water as possible. In other words, trying to replace the alcohol I used to drink with water. Seems noble, right?

...not necessarily. Last week I made it my job to drink more water. The doctors recommended I get 2-3L per day, but a few weeks ago I peed out two kidney stones and freaked out because I found out later I still have two more in me. So, I drank 7L of water in one day, with the last 4L being in the span of a few hours. I must've peed like 20 times in a period of 8 hours and was feeling very fatigued.

After watching TV with my husband, I tried to stand up and found that it was incredibly hard to do so. I was experiencing vertigo, a migraine, and intense disorientation. It was then that my husband suggested that maybe I drank too much water, after which I became familiar with the world of water poisoning.

Don't drink too much water, y'all!! We went to the emergency room and I ended up being fine, but it took a few hours for the water to pass through my system. Thankfully it wasn't poisoning, but I definitely drank too much water and enough to cause some pretty severe reactions.

Thankfully I didn't drink too much because it can be fatal! But please take my TIFU as a warning that you should make sure you're being hydrated, but not too much!

But now it's just been a silly response to say when friends ask me how my sobriety is going. But I'm grateful that it wasn't fatal!

"TIFU by poisoning myself with nuts Back in April, when we were locked down in my country, I would hang out on my back deck in the evening and enjoy a few beers.

During a weekly supply run I spotted a 1kg (2.2 pound) bag of Brazil nuts on special. “Hey, those would go well with beer” I thought.

That night I FaceTimed a friend and got through around half the bag while drinking a six pack. In the morning I had a slight stomach ache but figured it was because I drank too much.

The next afternoon I had a surprise call from an old friend. Because I’d skipped lunch, I snacked on more nuts while we were chatting. Later that night I had a few more beers and finished the bag. As it turned out, big mistake.

Day three I woke up feeling like a rock a rock in my stomach. During the day the rock grew knives and by mid afternoon I was bedridden, groaning in pain with each breath.

I took some pain killers and tried to rest. It must just be a bug, how much longer could this go on?” I thought. 

By midnight I was desperate and exhausted. I was having trouble breathing and basically just crying with pain and exhaustion. We have 2 small children sleeping and a can’t possibly drive myself to hospital so I called an ambulance. I managed to stand and met them at the door. I nearly passed out from the effort so they led me back to the bedroom. As I sat, one experienced ambulance officer saw the look in my eyes and instinctively reached for a bin in the corner, just in time for me to projectile vomit. I’d never felt so ill in all my life.

After some tests they eventually decided to take me in for observation. After strong pain meds I finally got a few hours sleep and was discharged early the same morning. I got home and slept for about 10hrs straight. In the end I chalked it up to food poisoning. 

Fast forward a few months, mentioned the story to a friend who’s a dietitian. “What kind of nuts were they?” She asked. “Brazil nuts. Why’s that?” I replied. It turns out Brazil nuts have a very high concentration of selenium. Even just a handful can make you sick. If you eat enough you could actually suffer terrible side effects like brain damage, hair loss, liver malfunction or even death. She said I was probably lucky to get off without more lasting damage after eating so many.

TL/DR: binged on Brazil nuts, ended up hospitalised with selenium poisoning.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'poisoning', 'myself', 'with', 'nuts', 'back', 'in', 'april', 'when', 'we', 'were', 'locked', 'down',

"TIFU by cutting off my fingertip  So lemme make this short and sweet, so I was cutting potatoes for my beef stew i was making and while cutting the slippery fuckers my knife slipped and sliced through my fingertip 3/4 through, i knew what would happen so i went to my dad and just said very calmly ""I don't think this is good"" Then proceeded to almost black out but was able to keep myself awake, The finger was bleeding everywhere and my dad was trying to cover it as quick as he could, I was struggling to keep myself awake as all my senses went bye bye. See I don't have problems with blood it was caused by the INTENSE FUCKING PAIN from it. My neighbor finally came over and i was starting to come to again and regain the senses. They wrapped duct tape over the bandages which was an odd thing but it was to keep water away from it. I didn't get to see it until the next day when we were taking care of it. I peeled it back and my god, it was like a raisin, a bloody torn apart raisin with a weird fleshy flap. I wrapped it back up and being the dumbass I am I didn't go to get stitches, Basically 2 days later my mom saw it and called the doctor place thing to see if it is to late for stitches... Well it was and all i can do now is get it suctioned which i need to be awake for i think so yeah. Fun weekend.

"TIFU by letting my gf do my laundry Yesterday, after a long day of driving, my gf and I get to my place and while I’m bringing stuff in from the car she’s getting her cat settled and picks up a bit around the place, on account of her bringing the cat over for the first time. She then goes to start a load of laundry, which I said she didn’t have to do, but she wanted to help out since I had been the one driving. She starts the washer, we make some pizza, and watch some tv. 

After a few episodes I got up to get a drink and she asks me to switch over the laundry, at which I jokingly let out a exasperated sigh and a drawn out ‘fine.’ I go to open the washer and paused when I looked inside. Everything was covered in these weird patches of white, and my first thought wasn’t pleasant. You know those white, strandy egg sacks you see in spider nests? Yeah, gross, and they were covering everything in the washer... But then I saw something else, a teal piece of plastic. Wtf? I pull it out and what do I find? The plastic wrapping for a pack of Angel Soft. The pack I had on the shelf above, with the remaining 1 or 2 rolls of toilet paper, had at some point fallen off the shelf and into the washing machine. Then my gf throws a load of clothes in on top of it without looking. So now all the clothes are covering in damp, half dissolved toilet paper and I break out in laughter. She’s embarrassed, I’m dying of laughter, and my washing machine looks like a Walmart toilet bowl.

There’s no way we were getting all that wet toilet paper off so we start throwing small portions of clothing in the dryer at a time hoping it’ll all catch in the lint trap. It kinda works but a lot still needs to be shaken off and now it looks like it snowed in my laundry room due to the amount of toilet paper dryer lint covering the floor and trailing to my room. Gf keeps apologizing and offering to replace anything while I’m relishing in how much material this has given me to mess with her.  She even bought me some more tp, I just had to make sure it didn’t end up in the wash. I’ll be doing my own laundry for a while now.

TLDR: let my GF do my laundry, unintentionally added an extra ingredient, resulting in my laundry looking like Casper got a little too “friendly” with the load.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'letting', 'my',

"TIFU by relapsing So, I'm living in a halfway house for drug rehab, and have been here one month.
Technically I fucked up yesterday, but I tried to post and the bot here removed said post for being too short.

Anyway, yesterday I was allowed to go out to get some much-needed winter gear. I hadn't heard from my [35M] husband [31M] since the day before, and I assumed he was out doing meth - that's his thing, along with denial.  The longer it had been, after asking people if they'd heard from him, I got more anxious. I pretty much had a panic attack after a few more hours of no info, and grabbed some keyboard cleaner and huffed like 3 cans.

I am a poly-substance abuser, and addicted to escapism. I have been doing well for 3 months, and clearly couldn't handle this unexpected stress. I know huffing is disgusting, the worst kind of high one can chase.

"TIFU by insulting my coworker's face for an hour straight without knowing it Obligatory, this happened probably 15 years ago: I traveled to to Pocatello, ID to set up a new building with some co-workers. I caught the worst cold of my life, but we were all working late to get the systems up and running for the next day. At that age~19, I prided myself about my strong work ethic and never thought I should be a better co-worker to not get other people sick. I'm a really quiet, nice, would never swear, never touched drugs or alcohol on my life kind of guy at this age.

At any rate, my nose was like a faucet, so I took a break, went to a grocery store to get some medicine. I had never taken medicine in my life up to this point, let alone bought medicine due to dumb family beliefs. I understood the concept, but had no idea what to get for my cold. I asked a store worker what to get for a really bad cold. He told me, ""Get these ones. They're really good."" I thought to myself, okay, this cold is really bad, take triple whatever it says to take to really solve this cold. So I did.

I get back to the office and I keep looking at my coworkers laptop. He has this background picture of Andre Kirilinko, a basketball player on the Utah Jazz. Well, I did something rude about how I couldn't believe his agent would let them take such a terrible picture of him. All my coworkers laughed really hard. I thought, ""I'm so funny!"" So I made another joke that he looked like a manbearpig and he's coming right for us! Everyone laughed even more! So I just start railing on Andre Kirilinko's ugly face for like another 50 minutes with coworkers laughing like I'm hilarious (I'm sure I wasn't that funny, but I was drunk off the cold pills and thought I was Jerry Seinfeld with this primo material). 

Well, my jokes hit a lull and I decided to scoot over, closer to his laptop. My dumb F up was the entire night, but I looked at my friend's laptop and at the bottom, I read something. I said, ""What an idiot! They spelled his name wrong even! What MORONS!"" It was spelled ""Kirk-ilinko"" because my friend's name was Kirk. 

Then I looked at the face again and see that it was a crappy square Paintbrush Photoshop copy of Kirk's face on Kirilinko's body. I exclaimed, ""oh my gosh! That's your face!!! Ahhhagahaha! That's so funny! Oh my gosh!!! Ahahaha ! I'm so hahaha! Sorry! Hahahahaha!"" and all my coworkers were awkwardly laughing again and I couldn't stop laughing because they were laughing and vice versa. I was like an embarrassed hyena, red in the face, trying to apologize while laughing harder than I ever did in my life for some reason. I ran away to the bathroom cackling like a maniac, tears running down my face from it all. I'm sure the echoes of my laughter filling the empty floor sucked too. Another coworker, also laughing uncontrollably, said he'd drive me to the hotel, which he did. But I was still laughing the entire drive and all night until I feel asleep. The third friend that drove me home said it was funny because it wasn't anything like me, but didn't know why I kept going and going and going and that made it funnier because of how awkward it was.

The next morning, I apologized profusely to Kirk. He was so nice to forgive me, but I never have forgiven myself. I tried to buy him breakfast every morning for about two weeks, but he wouldn't have it. It's my most embarrassing moment of my life and I can't believe I was such an idiot and jerk. I still haven't touched alcohol to this day, partly because of this night.

TLDR: I got drunk on cold pills and made fun of my coworkers face for an hour straight because he photoshopped his face onto a basketball player and I didn't notice it was him, but made fun of the face relentlessly.

"TIFU by ordering both Krystal’a and Domino’s. So this TIFU just happened and it’s kinda funny. So I had just gotten off work and decided to smoke a blunt and some of a dab pen. My girlfriend and I got pretttyyyy high and just chilled out listened to music and played Rocket League. Eventually we got the all consuming munchies that occurs... and realized we didn’t lay out any food.
First we tried to DoorDash some Krystals... the total ended up being around $30. After waiting on it for 1.5 hours stuck on “Preparing your order.” Without actually having a driver yet. 
Long story we ended up ordering some Domino’s... cause they are always open for delivery. That also totaled out to $30..
We were under the impression that the Krystals order had cancelled since they closed before we found a driver..... we soon found this was not the case.
We got our Domino’s order. Ravenous with hunger, we prepared to eat the delicious feast of the domino gods. 
Right as we began I saw more headlights in our driveway... we live on the end a tiny road that no one else is on and has not outlet. So to find an unexpected car in our driveway at Midnight is odd. I came outside with a knife in my pocket ready for war. Not knowing what I was to find down my stairs in the driveway... 
Behold... the doordash driver! With our ..... Krystals. 
So... we got $60 worth of food. For two people.
I guess the lesson here is don’t order food when your high. Or just stupid in my case.😂

"I hate our pet fish and want them to die. Back in 2020, as a 'present', my mum got our 3 year old daughter two fish for her birthday. She gave us a tank that was too small and fish that required a heater. She did not provide a heater.

After spending a considerable amount of money on the right kit and food, we reluctantly delved in to fish ownership. Fish are overrated and time consuming. You can't cuddle them. Every week, we have to carve out time to ensure the tank is cleaned and their environment is maintained to a good standard. Even then, the water stays green! And yes, we have tried many a treatment and method. 

Our daughter doesn't bother with them, despite encouragement and trying to teach her responsibility. She's even forgotten their names. 

There are times that I plan the 'accidental' death of these fish. This could be not adding the water treatment or maybe a little too much food and even just flushing them down the toilet. I will never follow through with this as it's just cruel. Meanwhile, we have had fish ownership thrust on to us and no reward for this. I just want them to die naturally but I expect they'll live for so long and this is our life now.

"I feel so lonely a love scene on Netflix made me cry Title says it all actually. I'm afraid this will be a lengthy post.

Since the first Covid lockdown in March 2020 I have been at home. I (25 next week) still live with my parents and sibling, who also happen to be at home 24/7 now. My mom is a nurse, so naturally we all try to follow the government rules as we don't want to indirectly infect my mother's patients. As a consequence, and maybe even due to the constant media attention to the measurements, we even keep our distance to each other as a family. We're no longer hugging or showing any other forms of affection.

Also since the first lockdown, I have barely worked outside of our house. Theaters have closed and I have worked approximately 30 shifts in the past 10 months. I have zero contact with any of my coworkers. Life just goes on, I guess, and when you're in your early 20s but detest going out, you're not really part of the group.

I must admit, I do not have many friends. I haven't been very lucky, I had three of my so-called best friends completely cut me off without prior notice (sometimes it makes me wonder what I did wrong or if I even deserve to have friends, but that's a whole different story). I have two groups of friends, 12 people in total, though this is not very important information. I have physically seen some of my friends twice since March, and on one of those days a family member died, so I was a mess. Since the lockdown, we do have weekly Skype calls, and that's as close as we get. Most of the time, I have to initiate conversation or else I could go on for days without communication. It makes me feel so useless, but it's sadly one of the effects of social media. People just think a lot about themselves.

Also a factor in this whole backstory is the end of my first relationship, which was a little over 2,5 years ago. Since we broke up, I haven't been dating, seeing anyone or slept with anyone. The only thing that occurred recently was an attempt at a Facebook Messenger sext with a guy who I've know for years but who has a gf now. Basically, the best I could do was become the digital, but unofficial, side piece (let me be clear, I'm not on board with that).

All in all, this means I haven't really been touched in any way in ages. Imagine my surprise when I was watching Bridgerton and a steamy scene occurred. It wasn't overly graphic, but for some reason I could feel the guy's hands, felt the echo of his lips on mine. This just let loose an incredible yearning for not only intimacy, but the basic human needs of affection and communication.

So, here I am, almost 2AM in the morning, alone and crying behind my laptop because two actors on Netflix pretended to get laid for the first time.",0,"['feel', 'so', 'lonely', 'love', 'scene', 'on',

"TIFU by making such a novice google mistake So my buddy made a joke about the local pub getting a new name. He joked it was going to be called The Dani and Horse (his brother is named Dani, the joke obviously being that he changed the ‘Cock’ in ‘Cock and Horse’ to Dani). 

Dani got upset about this joke because he thought we were making fun of him and his friend (he has been friend zoned for years, his brother and I can’t help but crack a joke about it every once in a while. The funny thing about thát was that his brother didn’t actually mean it like that and we thought it was hilarious Dani just called his friend a horse). 

Anyway back to my TIFU. 

I thought I would explain the joke to Dani. So, in my charming innocence, I thought it would be a good idea to google a picture of a pub named ‘The cock and Horse’ to show Dani it really is a thing. (They’re both British btw so I really don’t know how he doesn’t know this). Upon putting The ‘cock and Horse’ in Google I was unpleasantly surprised google did not immediately understand what exactly I was trying to find. 

TL;DR: I googled cock and horse expecting a picture of a pub, got horsecocks instead",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'making', 'such', 'novice', 'google', 'mistake', 'so', 'my', 'buddy', 'made', 'joke', 'about', 'the', 'local', 'pub', 'getting', 'new', 'name', 'he', 'joked', 'it', 'was', 'going', 'to', 'be', 'called', 'the', 'dani', 'and', 'horse', 'his', 'brother', 'is', 'named', 'dani', 'the', 'joke', 'obviously', 'being', 'that', 'he', 'changed', 'the', 'cock', 'in', 'cock', 'and', 'horse', 'to', 'dani', 'dani', 'got', 'upset', 'about', 'this', 'joke', 'because', 'he', 'thought', 'we', 'were', 'making', 'fun', 'of', 'him', 'and', 'his', 'friend', 'he', 'has', 'been', 'friend', 'zoned', 'for', 'years', 'his', 'brother', 'and', 'can’t', 'help', 'but', 'crack', 'joke', 'about', 'it', 'every', 'once', 'in', 'while', 'the', 'funny', 'thing', 'about', 'thát', 'was', 'that', 'his', 'brother', 'didn’t', 'actually', 'mean', 'it', 'like', 'that', 'and', 'we', 'thought', 'it', 'was', 'hilarious', 'dani', 'just', 'called', 'his', 'friend', 'horse', 'anyway', 'back', 'to', 'my', 'tifu', 'thought', 'would', 'explain', 'the', 'joke', 'to', 'dani', 'so', 'in', 'my', 'charming', 'innocence', 'thought', 'it', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'to', 'google', 'picture', 'of', 'pub', 'named', 'the', 'cock', 'and', 'horse', 'to', 'show', 'dani', 'it', 'really', 'is', 'thing', 'they’re', 'both', 'british', 'btw', 'so', 'really', 'don’t', 'know', 'how', 'he', 'doesn’t', 'know', 'this', 'upon', 'putting', 'the', 'cock', 'and', 'horse', 'in', 'google', 'was', 'unpleasantly', 'surprised', 'google', 'did', 'not', 'immediately', 'understand', 'what', 'exactly', 'was', 'trying', 'to', 'find', 'tl', 'dr', 'googled', 'cock', 'and', 'horse', 'expecting', 'picture', 'of', 'pub', 'got', 'horsecocks', 'instead']",tifu by making such novice google mistake so my buddy made joke about the local pub getting new name he joked it was going to be called the dani and horse his brother is named dani the joke obviously being that he changed the cock in cock and horse to dani dani got upset about this joke because he thought we were making fun of him and his friend he has been friend zoned for years his brother and can’t help but crack joke about it every once in while the funny thing about thát was that his brother didn’t actually mean it like that and we thought it was hilarious dani just called his friend horse anyway back to my tifu thought would explain the joke to dani so in my charming innocence thought it would be good idea to google picture of pub named the cock and horse to show dani it really is thing they’re both british btw so really don’t know how he doesn’t know this upon putting the cock and horse in google was unpleasantly surprised google did not immediately understand what exactly was trying to find tl dr googled cock and horse expecting picture of pub got horsecocks instead,tifu by making such novice google mistake so my buddy made joke about the local pub getting new name he joked it wa going to be called the dani and horse his brother is named dani the joke obviously being that he changed the cock in cock and horse to dani dani got upset about this joke because he thought we were making fun of him and his friend he ha been friend zoned for year his brother and can’t help but crack joke about it every once in while the funny thing about thát wa that his brother didn’t actually mean it like that and we thought it wa hilarious dani just called his friend horse anyway back to my tifu thought would explain the joke to dani so in my charming innocence thought it would be good idea to google picture of pub named the cock and horse to show dani it really is thing they’re both british btw so really don’t know how he doesn’t know this upon putting the cock and horse in google wa unpleasantly surprised google did not immediately understand what exactly wa trying to find tl dr googled cock and horse expecting picture of pub got horsecocks instead,tifu by make such novic googl mistak so my buddi made joke about the local pub get new name he joke it wa go to be call the dani and hors hi brother is name dani the joke obvious be that he chang the cock in cock and hors to dani dani got upset about thi joke becaus he thought we were make fun of him and hi friend he ha been friend zone for year hi brother and can’t help but crack joke about it everi onc in while the funni thing about thát wa that hi brother didn’t actual mean it like that and we thought it wa hilari dani just call hi friend hors anyway back to my tifu thought would explain the joke to dani so in my charm innoc thought it would be good idea to googl pictur of pub name the cock and hors to show dani it realli is thing they’r both british btw so realli don’t know how he doesn’t know thi upon put the cock and hors in googl wa unpleasantli surpris googl did not immedi understand what exactli wa tri to find tl dr googl cock and hors expect pictur of pub got horsecock instead
"Tifu by accidentally writing a suicide note This actually happened years and years ago when I was in fourth or fifth grade but I just remembered about it today so I thought I’d share. You see, I used to live in a town just outside of St. Louis Missouri, so we were on the very edge of tornado alley. For some reason I developed a strange fascination and fear of tornadoes. I was paranoid, I still get paranoid. Even if there was only a slight thunderstorm, I’d be terrified that there would be a tornado, and throughout my childhood and time living there, I had many nightmares about tornadoes that I still remember to this day. Now that you understand my slightly irrational phobia of tornadoes, this takes place one day at my elementary school. the sky was so dark that it felt like night, and I was in class and could see out the windows at the rain pouring and the lightning and the sky becoming an ominous green color. I wasn’t paying attention because I was so anxious about the possibility of a tornado on its way. Because of this, my child brain had nothing better to do than write a will, just in case I died in the tornado that I was positive was coming. I wrote the will on a notecard which probably went along the lines of ‘my dog goes to my parents, my iPad goes to my little brother, everything else goes to my best friend, goodbye cruel cruel world.’ Yes, I was a very dramatic child. Long story short, no tornado came, at least not that day, and by the end of school the storm had let up and everything was fine. Obviously then, I wasn’t going to die so I no longer needed the will. I recycled the notecard.  A day or so passed when I get called into the counselors office. I had no idea what this was about, for context I was barely aware of what suicide even was at this point in my life. She showed me the notecard and told me that someone had found it in the recycling bin and if I knew what it was. At this point was relived I wasn’t in trouble even though I didn’t understand what was wrong, so I laughed. She told me she was relived I was laughing and I told her the story. That’s basically it, not the most climactic story but for sure embarrassing to look back on.

"TIFU - I got my bag stuck in a metro door for a very long time I got on the metro in Chengdu, China to take my normal three stop, 15 minute journey to work.  If you've been on a typical early morning Chengdu metro, you'll know they are packed like sardines in a cans - extremely full!. Just as someone was getting off,  they bumped into me and knocked me into the door, while the door was closing. A cord on my bag got trapped in the door and was totally stuck in the door. I tried to remove it but it wasn't budging. Normally, the door would open at the next stop, no problem! There was a problem, though. The next stop, the doors switched, so the door opposite opened and the door that I was attached to would remain closed until the terminal 1.5 hours away. I spent the rest of the journey leaning on the door, hiding my bag, pretending there was no issue. If my bag was empty, I probably would have just got off and left it in the door as a work of art. At the terminal, I notified a conductor who had to call an engineer. The engineer used some tool to pry open the door. 30 mins later, and 2 hours after I set off, I was free. I told my employers and tried to laugh off the problem, but employers are often very direct in Chengdu. They just gave me a soft telling off for being late and deducted it from my salary.

"TIFU by copy pasting NSFW text in my presentation slide This happened just last week. So, I had a meeting with my boss and the clients I have in my company. I was just browsing through Omegle and having fun video chatting with random strangers before the meeting. It's so hard to type in the chat box so I had a NSFW template ready to paste and send. For some reason I pasted that phrase in my presentation just before my meeting and when the time of meeting came, I started sharing my screen.

"I'm considering if I should stop being so nice and polite to literally everyone and start being a mean asshole I just got back from the Rheumatologist after waiting since June (the referral). The doctor said I have Arthritis after I told him I get joint dislocations, have joint hypermobility all over my body, my joints move out of place and click into place, my skin is stretchy, I have a fast heart rate when I stand up + brain fluid leaking out my spinal chord.

He concluded it's just Arthritis, I had a blood test for antibodies (to see if the arthritis is autoimmune) and I'm waiting on the results.

My mom is mad at me because I didn't say that he's wrong and it must be Ehlers Danlos, that I didn't criticize him or question him or keep going on about every tiny symptom I have. He didn't do any physical examination aside from pressing on my joints but I showed him the hand trick I could do and how my skin is stretchy.

I didn't want to say ''I think I have Ehlers Danlos'' because that comes across as a WebMD hypochondriac but my mom says ''if you're nice people treat you like crap'' and ''you're too passive'' etc

Yet my mom literally a week ago said ''if the Rheumatologist doesn't say you have Ehlers Danlos don't argue with them, they've seen hundreds of patients and know what they're doing''.

&amp; I was taught from an early age that questioning what family members say or explaining things after someone has concluded something different is ''talking back'' or ''arguing''.

I know it sounds stupid but it's like I have someone who lives in my head who says ''don't be rude or speak back, that makes you a bad person, you want to be a GOOD person don't you? So just accept that the guy with the PhD says and don't question it.''

But now I'm wondering if I should just do a 180 on this ''be nice/never be rude or bad'' philosophy.",0,"[""i'm"", 'considering', 'if', 'should', 'stop', 'being', 'so', 'nice', 'and', 'polite', 'to',

"TIFU showing my main Reddit to my coworker... but not as much as he FU'd showing me his. Alternate account for privacy reasons. 

So, hey, coworker. If you are brave enough to come back to Reddit after today I am sorry I am telling Reddit about this but it is just too funny.

TL:DR at the bottom.

So I fuck up a lot in a day. Really, I could have posted here before a few times, but this really takes the cake. 

I (F) work in tech support. We pretty much all use Reddit. So when I posted a picture of my cat and it got over 1k likes, I was like hooray! Coolios! And I sent the link to 3 of my coworkers (M) to show how proud I was of her, and to give them a little chuckle cause they all like cats too.

Then I remembered oh, shit... i post NSFW stuff on my Reddit.

Now it's not what you think!! I was more embarassed that I had stuff tagged NSFW. I'm really into piercings/tattoos/mods and post mildly bloody stuff sometimes, so naturally they are flagged nsfw. Nothing I'd be fired about, but I didn't want them to think I was willy nilly posting nudes and linking people to my Reddit.

So I shared this funny little anxiety attack with the one coworker who had an incredible fuckup today.

I went on with my day and worked for oh, idk, an hour before checking in on the progress my cat had make with likes. 1.1k likes. Nice! And a new follower?? what a treat!

Oh, what a... weird pervy username? NSFW profile? Might be body mods though?

So I peeked behind my shoulder, no one in the office, and unblurred the images.

Oh MAN that's a lot of dong. Oh? He's holding a local brew? Oh... he's from the city I live in...

All the while sharing these findings with my coworker. 

Now, I say he's my coworker, as in we work IT for the same company. I mostly escalate work to his team and we have a good working relationship but we work with different teams at different sites. I've seen him in person 3 times, total. I hardly recognized him on the street to be perfectly honest, we talk over the phone or through the work IM system.

So anyway I'm describing this pervy weirdo to my colleague because CRAZY COINCIDENCE, HE LIVES IN THE SAME CITY AS ME!

... I'm not very bright, guys.

Thank GOD I picked the right one of the 3 of my coworkers to present my findings to of this TOTALLY WACKY COINCIDENCE.

So he says ""oh god. Im sorry. I didnt know you could see who your followers were""

Cue cry-laughing at my desk. Guys I had to go into the utility room to call my best friend absolutely hysterical about this.

I ESCALATE TECH SUPPORT TO HIM. IT DID NOT OCCURR TO ME THAT HE WOULD MAKE SUCH AN OVERSIGHT.

So yeah we talked about it. He's an incredibly valuable member of our team, super professional, and just a nice guy. Apparently with an exhibitionist streak...

TLDR: Shared a cat photo with my coworkers and was embarassed by some body mod posts I made being marked NSFW. One coworker followed me and did not know I could see all of his very NSFW nude content.

I am not going to HR. I told my husband who also knows him. We had a really good laugh about it. Resuming business as usual tomorrow.

Edit: typo

Edit 2: minor details that would've bugged me

Edit 3: oh yeah... after he calmed down a bit I told him that when you delete your Reddit account it doesn't actually delete the photos so they're still just there chillin. He said he felt less awful now that he's calmed down, and he'll deal with it another time. What's done is done 🤷‍♀️

Edit 4: I guess I didn't make it super clear but he *deleted his account*",1,"['tifu', 'showing', 'my', 'main', 'reddit', 'to', 'my', 'coworker', 'but', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'he', ""fu'd"",

"TIFU by getting a covid test at the wrong place. I worked at a hole in the wall restaurant off the gulf coast in mid-Louisiana. We are in an area highly susceptible to hurricanes. For Hurricane Delta, the water rose up to the ceiling on the first level. I went back to work after about a month of cleanup and re building. A week or two later one of my coworkers tested positive when her high school opened back up. All 4 employees and the manager was forced by the owner to get tested. The manager and other 3 employees were mother/daughter/son/niece (respectively), so they all got tested together. The owner told us all he would pay us back for the test whatever the cost. The family of workers’ tests costed $55 each, which I was not aware of. I went to one of the other urgent cares to get my test, which turned out to be $345 because my insurance wouldn’t cover it due to me having no symptoms. After 2 weeks of quarantine, the joint finally opened back up. When I would ask about getting repaid, which I was very open about the cost with them right when I was charged, the manager floundered about the idea another week and a half. I texted the owner himself so I could see about getting my money back, he told me they are “literally giving away free tests all over (city nearish me)” and told me he’d pay me a $55 copay. I texted back saying he could keep his $55 copay and I would no longer be working there. He texted back later and gaslighted me saying he would pay the $345 “not because of the message above but because i want to.”

I’m 17 and currently unemployed because of this. It’s hard to find a job around my area and especially at my age, and most of all working with my schedule being a high school senior.

Was I in the wrong for quitting on the spot or should they have been more than willing to be true to their word and pay me whatever cost the test was like they said they would?

"TIFU by pointing out to my friend (F) that her date might* be gay  My friend went on a date today and about an hour shared his pic with me. Lo and behold! Turns out, I know this guy. Not only are we acquainted but I think he might be gay. We have met a couple of times in various events and I once overheard him saying how being gay is really not accepted where he is from and ""it's difficult for us"". From his words, it seemed that he is gay (or bi). However, we aren't close enough for me to ask him this directly.

I told my friend about this and we spend about an hour with her recollecting the date and seeing if there were any signs. It does seem like she has a crush on this guy and the thought of this guy being gay was surely disappointing for her.

Worst thing, she can't even really ask him this directly right at the beginning and she doesn't want to make up a story to get it out of him. Neither does she want to go on for like 5-7 dates and then find out.

Quite a tough spot she has gotten into. If he isn't gay, then my bad for giving her a couple of sleepless nights. If he is, well, that's a while different can of worms.

"I’ve doxed a few dozen people for treating the pandemic with insufficient caution Offenses ranged from going to parties in their friends’ basement, to going to eat inside restaurants, to going to bars, to going to nonessential but not social things during the pandemic (think art lessons, and other frivolities like that)

Do I regret it? Not in the slightest. Once you behave in a selfish manner that puts everyone else’s life at risk, you forfeit your right to be treated well.

Many on reddit will disagree (since most redditors seem to think that COVID is either a meme or a hoax), but from my point of view, what I did was not only justifiable, but actually righteous and the proper course of action. 

So far, none of them have blown up online, but you can find their dox and the details of their infractions scattered across the internet.

"TIFU by accidentally posting a picture that said anal destruction in my photography classes zoom chat Today I Fucked up by sending a bad picture to a zoom chat.  I was sending a message telling my teacher that I was late to class because my wifi was having issues.  everything is fine.  another student asks a question in the chat and being the nice person I am I go-to answer.  however I was still messaging the teacher so I sent her the message, simple mistake.  I highlight it and control c the answer and choose to send it to everyone instead of just the teacher.  for some reason, the text did not copy and sleepy I just did control v enter quickly posting the last thing I had copied before class, which was this [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/568715152514351104/791531445499592725/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/568715152514351104/791531445499592725/unknown.png)

(was sending it to a friend)

I don't realize my mistake right away and so the teacher opened it and says I assume this wasn't for me.  I said oops and asked if she could delete it.  by then a couple of people had opened it and were laughing and I was mortified. there is also apparently no way to delete any chat in zoom which is a terrible feature.  so it sat there for the rest of the class.  I'm still quite embarrassed

"I’m not sure I know the difference between an emotional affair and close friendship with a woman....but I may be approaching the line. I’m overall content with my marriage and family. I would never sleep with another woman. But, my wife is very emotionally distant. She’s quiet. It’s very hard on me. 

I’ve found myself connected closely with some female family friends. There’s one in particular that I have gotten particularly close to. There has never been any suggestive talk or anything remotely close to inappropriate action. But, she’s been there for me as a friend several times. There’s no one I respect more I. The world, and I just genuinely enjoy our friendship.

"Not going to DIE Speaking from my heart.

Every night when I go to sleep,I always think to not getting up in the morning.
I do not want to exist anymore
I do not want to do sucide.
Yes I want to die but via natural cause.
I wanted to die via corona virus
Painless death

But idea of sucide have came to my mind so many time.
But I do not want my parents thinking that they failed.
My parents love me so much..
You guys can't imagine

Only reason I am living right now is my parents

Otherwise I am done with my life

I am so sad from inside.
I always wake up in mid night and cry my self to sleep.

My sadness is known to my parents

They always try to chear me up.

I am ruined now.
I can't be happy.

There is always water in my eyes.
Always crying

My mind hurts from over thinking

Only time I am really happy .
When I go to gym 

My anger fits are getting regular

I know my mom and dad wants me to get well soon 
But I don't think I can be.

So I know I am ruined and always be sad
I have accepted that..

My father is  60 and my mom is 55 
They are healthy people.
So they both have atleast 25+ year left.

I will do sucide after that..
I will be alive for them.

I know sadness has taken over me.
I will be sad forever.
But I will live for them.

Or death happen via natural cause..

Or if something good happen and my my head stop hurting and sadness goes aways..
Watery eyes go away

I have 25 year left..

Sorry for bad English not my first language

"TIFU by making eggs So this happened like 2 months ago.

So lunch comes around, i decide i want to make eggs and ramen, now i like to crush my ramen in when making eggs and ramen, why? No clue. Anyways, i crush the ramen, fill it with water and microwave it, then i make my eggs, i used 4-5 eggs, i put butter on the pan, make scrambled eggs, i plate the eggs on a paper plate, then i go place my pan and spatula in the sink, only to slip on water and kick a metal grate like it was the kick off to the superbowl. So im sitting here swearing so hard that it would make a sailor proud as a father teaching his child to ride a bike. My toenail (the top part) died instantly, so i had to clip it off. Theres blood all over my toe at the time, due to my stupidity. Turns out my dishwasher was leaking. Like badly. Also the toe next to my big toe was so bruised for so long youd think i had to of broken it.

"TIFU by breaking my word in a Russian prison It happened in a Russian prison. In a Penal Colony, to be precise. We celebrated the 2014 New Year on a grand scale - homemade cakes, a lot of salads consisting of everything, and home brew... Lots of home brew. 

The morning of January 1st comes. Everyone is slowly waking up and coming to their senses. Life returns to it's usual groove. A friend comes to visit me. He lives in another barrack. But if careful and imperceptible, it was possible to violate territory of the local sector. He was a good friend; we constantly supported each other. We would share useful things, and sometimes, we stood up for serious conflicts. 

\- Well, have you given up smoking? 

\- What do you mean? - (I did not understand.) 

\- Well, we have agreed to quit smoking together on January 1st. At 23:57 I smoked the last cigarette and that's it. Have you forgotten? 

\- No! Of course I remember! Same shit - I haven't smoked since night. 

I say all this, and feel my face turn red. I had a desire to sink into the floor. I completely forgot about our agreement, and extinguished the last cigarette literally a second before his arrival. We discussed something else, wished eachother a Happy New Year, drank tea  and he left. I remember looking at this cloudy sediment in a mug and realized that this was it. My fucked up shame. It's not when someone laughs at you and says something behind your back, insults you or tries to humiliate you. No. It is a shame to your conscience, character and will. Since that day I have not smoked. I just couldn't afford to be so weak. 

I have been without cigarettes for seven years now, and I am incredibly happy about that. By the way, a friend lit a cigarette two weeks later. I do not blame him. Life too taught me this.

"I just want my story heard. I (25)f was born into a family that was strictly ""Christian"" we were from lower middle class. From the social eye our family of 5 seemed normal. But this was not the case. My dad is an absolute ass hole who often times would physically, emotionally, and psychologically abuse us. My mom is an alcholic who would enable his behavior while also psychologically abusing my sister and i. They together treated my older brother like the golden child while my older sister and i made due with scraps. My older brother is a narcissist who would sexually abuse me (the youngest child) while no one was home. (I kept that fact to myself for years) due to the ill treatment i have had a hard time trusting people and growing as an individual and member of society. I dont have my drivers liscence, i dont have a job, and i quiet honestly dont know how to be human. If it werent for my sister i dont think i would be alive quiet honestly.

"TIFU eating too much cannabutter (I'm in Canada where it's legal)

So I'm still recovering from this FU yesterday, I made butter for the first time and was really excited so I made brownies with them, thinking I mixed it with the normal butter and dosed the pan properly. Apparently not, because I had one piece and was fine, so I had another about an hour later and got baaaaaaaad high. There must've been a hotspot or something because dear lordy that went from 0-100 right quick.

I was useless on the couch shivering and anxious bad high, I couldn't focus visually on anything I could barely string a thought together other than ""i think I messed up"" It was not fun and lessons were learned. That was not my usual drunk equivalent, that felt like an OD that kept going. I ate the brownies around lunch and couldn't move till I think it was around 9ish when I crawled into bed.

I feel so gross today, like when you're getting over the flu and everything's achy and your stomach is sore from cramping up and you're nauseous but not enough to throw up. I don't feel good and I'm NEVER doing that again.

"TIFU by drinking peppermint oil So a little bit of background info, I don’t get enough fiber in my diet (or pretty much anything else due to working most of my waking hours without much of any breaks and not having time to eat) This causes severe constipation and other complications in my digestive system. I’ve dealt with this for some time and typically take supplements, but I haven’t in a while and it caught up to me. It was roughly 4:15 this morning as I pulled into my work place with an incapacitating stomach ache that seemed to be spreading into my lower back. I sat in my truck in agony for a few minutes before deciding to look up what might help. As I was desperate for some relief I quickly skimmed through many articles on the wonderful search engine that is Google and a couple mentioned peppermint oil can be used to sooth stomach aches. What I failed to realize is that it meant peppermint oil capsules, that dissolved in your stomach. Super proud of myself for my discovery, I reached in the glove box for the peppermint oil I used to sooth some sunburn over the summer that I just never took out.

 Down the hatch.

It only took a few moments to realize I may have just accidentally killed myself and my entire mouth and throat went numb and I stopped breathing. Every time I sucked in air i felt like a menthol cigarette ready to burn out. There I sat for 5-7 minutes berating myself for dying in such a stupid way in my work parking lot when all of a sudden it stopped. I happily jumped out my truck and was disappointed when I realized my stomach was hurting.

"I read the FB posts of recently deceased people If someone on a FB group or page posts or comments that they had a loved one pass away I'll click to their profile and read their public posts.

Starting with the person who mentioned the friend/family member passing, I'll click to their profile and I'll read whatever public memes/posts they've made starting from the first one that is grief-stricken. I don't know why - it kinda makes me feel their sadness too and relate to them. Obviously I don't tell the person I did this. We're strangers in a Facebook group, some of which have 20k+ members.

If the person who has passed had a FB page they are usually tagged in these posts. I must visit their page - afterall it's what I was originally seeking. I read the last few public posts to get a sense of the person they were, and I linger on their most recent posts thinking, ""what will be the last thing I ever post?"" ""Will some stranger read it and form an opinion about who I was or what kind of life I led?"" ""Was I gone too soon or did I live a full life?"" ""Was this sudden or expected"". I guess I'm contemplating my mortality as I examine the life of some stranger.

When my mom passed I used to visit her profile often to remember her so I think that's why I still do it? I don't know, it's cathartic or something. I kinda feel like I'm honoring the person by reading about them and thinking of them, and tend to feel part of the loss that yesterday this person posted a funny meme about Twisted Tea and today they will never post again. It's kinda eerie.

When I'm done thinking about the person I go back to whatever group/post/comment this stranger has announced that a loved one passed and I give them my condolences. I really feel for them and hope they'll be ok soon.  


  
EDIT:  


I wanted to thank all of you for responding and making me feel less creepy and weird about it. In responding to these comments I was reminded of this quote, which perhaps articulates why I feel I am honoring these people.  


  
 ""Some day soon, perhaps in forty years, there will be no one alive who has ever known me. That's when I will be truly dead - when I exist in no one's memory. I thought a lot about how someone very old is the last living individual to have known some person or cluster of people. When that person dies, the whole cluster dies,too, vanishes from the living memory. I wonder who that person will be for me. Whose death will make me truly dead?” ― Irvin D.

"TIFU by giving myself a chemical burn in my throat. Today I (55m) completely nuked my throat. I'm a fairly adventurous guy, I like hot foods and I don't shy away from eating them. A co-worker makes his own ""nut rub"" as he calls it which is ground peppers. Reapers, habaneros and ghost peppers. He uses this to add heat to all sorts of things. The star of my FU was jerky with reaper and ghost pepper dust liberally applied. It was hot. Nose running, eyes watering hot. That was okay, about 15 minutes later I was able to cope with things. The actual F to the U was later, about 3 hours after eating the jerky. I have a toothache. I use this liquid toothache medicine which is clove oil that you apply to a cotton ball (mini cotton ball) and then pack the cavity. I got my cotton ball loaded, put it into the affected molar and as soon as the oil mixed with my saliva and slid down my throat I was hit with a blinding pain. I couldn't breathe. My throat seized and refused to swallow. My tongue felt like it grew to 4 times its size and I began to salivate copiously. My nose started running, my eyes started watering and my throat was fucking aflame. This lasted about 4 lifetimes. Every second was agony. I was choking, gagging and coughing because the onrush of saliva was trying to go down my windpipe. The whole ordeal lasted a solid 5 minutes before I was finally able to work my tongue loose, swallow the torrent of spit going down my throat and stagger over to my lunch pail  and get a slug of water. It didn't help much. I finally gave up and left work early so I could get some oral anesthetic spray and went home. I'm currently sitting at my computer and contemplating my life choices while occasionally shooting the spray down my throat. Learn from my example and don't mix insanely hot foods with clove oil. Nothing good will come of it.

TL;DR Ate super hot beef jerky and later used clove oil toothache medicine, gave the back of my throat a pretty painful chemical burn.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'giving', 'myself', 'chemical', 'burn', 'in',

"Tifu by trying to get my boyfriend a birthday gift (Sorry if formatting is weird, I'm on mobile)

Wow, so this just happened. I'm amazed at how stupid I really just was. Just wow. I have common sense a lot,  just not when I'm shopping at late hours.

So there are these ads that come up all the time saying that you can get a specific ""over stocked"" item for free just by filling out a few quick surveys! Well this item happened to be exactly what I'm getting my boyfriend for his birthday. I can't say what it is in this post because my boyfriend follows me, but the item is worth $300. So I thought, 'Sure why not try this?"" 

When you click on the link it's one of those where you need to complete a number of deals in order to get the big reward. I think a total of nine. The deals are things like: you have to download a game and get to level three, or you need to sign up for a free trial. 

I only got through about four when I thought ""wow I should cancel the subscriptions as I go, so that I don't forget and end up getting charged a bunch of money."" As I go back to the website it notifies me that the subscriptions need to be active for 72 hours in order for it to be valid. Well shit.

At this point I decide that it would be way too much work to go back and redo all of the subscriptions and that I'd rather just buy the item instead of going through the hassle. When I go to cancel the last subscription, it says I have to call in order to cancel. While trying to look for other options I see that what I have a free trial to is a $40 subscription. What?! Okay, so now I'm hoping that I can just call tomorrow  to cancel and it will all be fine. The reason I'm most worried is because I can't find the website from doing a simple google search which leads me to believe it might not be a real website.

"TIFU By watching porn in the shower and having it fall behind the shower panel playing full volume, while my friends and girlfriend are directly below me. Obligatory throw away account due to friends/girlfriend know my username.

So I'm up at my friend's house in Vermont, old ski house, 120 years old. We've all been hanging out all week so after a full day of skiing I decided to treat myself to a nice long shower. 

(Bathroom is the only one in the house, we're all drinking beers. The shower is a very basic and is basically a metal box with a shower head)

I start watching some porn because my buddies are playing some tunes and my girlfriend is busy working. I'm feeling frisky so why the hell not. Meow. So anyways I get to showering and some self care when I go to adjust where in the ""film"" I'm at. I push the screen to move the bar then my phone just falls down a dark crevice where there's a slit just wider than my phone. Fuckkk. 

Naturally, instead of getting right to finding my phone, I sort myself out so I can focus. This fucking movie is a full feature length film and it's moving past the quieter blowjob part. I try pulling the shower out but it's glued to the floor. Then I get clothed to run to my car, past everyone, trying to keep it cool and grab a flat head to pull the panel of the shower out. No one any wiser I run back upstairs and find the fucking panel is so rusted to the other panels it's essentially glued in place. Again, fuck.  

There was a little attic space that was unfinished abutting the bathroom and directly behind the shower. I notice it's particle board over the top of sheet rock. I do as any self respecting man who's phone is blasting some girl getting railed by some rather gifted men and I start digging. I'm like Andy in Shawshank Redemption, careful not to make any noise when in between lulls in songs.

Light at the end of the tunnel! Holy fucking shit! I'm sweating while ripping away dry wall, careful not to make too much noise. After ripping away about half what I needed to take out my girlfriend knocks on the door... ""Honey, is everything okay? it seems like you've been in here a while?"" She asked while there is some muffled moaning that to me sounds super loud. ""Errr yes, I think the chili is just getting to me, nasty stuff going on in here"" She walks back downstairs and I get back to pulling off particle board/drywall. 

Finally! About 15 old razor blades and soap bars fall down and just behind it my phone! Thank Jesus! I walk back downstairs feeling like a champ and grab some freshly made curry. 

Tl;dr I go to have some self care after a long day of skiing and drop my phone in the trench behind an old shower.

"TIFU by offending my ""New family"" **A little bit of ""pre-story""**

So a couple of years ago my parents got divorced and not too long ago I got to meet my dads ""new family"" meaning his soon-to-be wife and her 3 children. All 3 of them are my age (late teens) or older.

So we planned to go to this waterpark and stay there for 3 days, just so we can get to know each other.

My dad is an extreme meat eater, he cannot stand eating salads or anything green on it's own, he always has got to eat meat next to it; he also cannot stand vegetarians and always makes sure to point it out.

""Sarah"" is one of my stepsisters.

**To the main story:**

So, I get picked up by my dad, we drive to the waterpark and arrive at the summerhouse that we have rented for 3 days, where I meet his new family (my stepmom, 4 stepsisters, and one of their boyfriends). They are quite possibly some of the most awkward people in the world and have absolutely no sense of humor. So after standing in the summerhouse and awkwardly chit-chatting, we decide to go out and get something to eat.

When we arrive at the restaurant (you guessed it) the mood is extremely awkward. So my dad starts talking, and starts talking about the steak he has just gotten and how great it is. Because the table is so silent, I try to get my dad to start some conversation, since he is the only person at the table who actually doesn't look like a statue; I then slide in a comment about my chicken wings and state that *""I could never stand being a vegetarian""* because I love chicken. My dad giggles a little bit, the same way that he always does when he is about to to sh\*ttalk vegetarians. (I expected my dad to pick up on my comment, since he always sh\*ttalks vegetarians). He turns to me, nods, and quietly (only I could hear it) says that *he thinks vegetarians are dumb people*, I answer with *""Well, a little strange, but not exactly dumb. But that's just because I can't imagine being a vegetarian.""*

After a couple of seconds of silence, he slowly turns to me and loudly says *""Oh, you can just ask (Lets call her Sarah) about being a vegetarian, since you think they are strange, she's a vegetarian...""* Suddenly my dad and the 5 other people at the table are staring at me in silence. I then nervously and blurt out *""Well, you're a vegetarian, that's totally understandable, atleast you're not a vegan, cause that is really weird""* In a horrible attempt to lighten the mood.

""*Uhh, I'm not vegetarian... I am a vegan...*"" she replies, and the table becomes dead silent; she becomes extremely angry and leaves. We half an hour later find out that she drove home and refused to come back to the waterpark... the 3 remaining days, his family just stares at me as if I'm some sort of monster who called ""Sarah"" a dumbass or something; they barely even talked to me... It's safe to say that I won't be seeing much of his new family.

Last time I saw the family was a couple of weeks ago, this thing happened many months ago; and they still carry a grudge...

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR; My dad who always rants about vegetarians, kinda ""baited"" me into starting a rant about vegetarians in front of my step-family who I just met. He tells me to ask ""Sarah"" about how life is as a vegetarian. I respond with *""Well, you're a vegetarian, that's totally understandable, atleast you're not a vegan, cause that is really weird.""* in an attempt to lighten the awkward mood at the table. She then corrects me and says she actually is a vegan; she becomes so offended that she drives home from the waterpark and refuses to come back. Now my entire stepfamily seems to hate me.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 1:

It seems that someone got offended by this, since they decided to PM me. To clarify I don't have anything against vegetarians or vegans, to be honest I couldn't care less about what people put in their mouth. It was just something that I said, because I kind of was panicking since I hate silences, and got kind of ""desperate"" for someone to actually talk. So no, I am not a ""Vegephobe"" or whatever you want to call it.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'offending', 'my', 'new', 'family', 'little', 'bit', 'of', 'pre', 'story', 'so', 'couple', 'of', 'years', 'ago',

awkward so my dad starts talking and starts talking about the steak he has just gotten and how great it is because the table is so silent try to get my dad to start some conversation since he is the

"Im a horny thieving crossdresser I'm a horrible and very horny person, and a religious person to add to that. 

So uh to start i guess I've stolen several girl's clothes because i find said girl cute and since i know i won't be able to have sex with her, I'd just steal said girl's gym clothes/extra clothes. 

I'd rummage through their schoolbags during lunchtime when no one's around and take them, sniff them, then quickly bag it, then when I'm at home I'd wait till 2 and wear their clothes while wanking off. after the quarantine started, I haven't been leaving the house at all, and since i haven't gotten my fair share of crossdressing, I've resorted to hopping the fence to the house over and stealing their daughter's underwear at night. i don't know why they dry it out at night, but I've stolen a lot. I'd throw them away after i got them covered in my spermic fluid.

"Ginger curse. Before I go off: This rant is really dumb and superficial, and I am not actually upset over this. I love my son and he is beautiful no matter what. 


So my dad and my step mom (shes been in my life since I was two) are both ginger. My dads closer to brown but its very much still red (and side note, my hair is doing exactly what his did. Start out platinumblond then darken, His darkened to red. I'm strawberryblond rn). And my step mom has burnt orange af hair.
But the thing she's got some sort of superiority complex with being a ginger. ""Ginger Pride"", she calls it. Her daughter; my stepsister, her hair is a beautiful red. My stepbrother hair is doing what mine and my dads is doing.
I got pregnant and she joke about my baby picking up that gene because ""ItS sUpErIoR"" *gag*

"TIFU by leading a group of American tourists who wanted to visit a portion of the Berlin Wall, but instead I took them to a completely random place in the opposite direction. This happened in 2015. I don’t remember the details, but here’s the gist of what happened.

I was backpacking in Europe in 2015. As I arrived to my hostel room in Berlin, I met a group of some really nice American tourists. We chatted for a bit, and since I was travelling solo, I asked to join them for some beers that night; it all went well, as far as I remember.

Next day, they wanted to visit some specific portion of the Berlin Wall (or something like that, I really don’t remember the details) and invited me to tag along (or maybe I invited myself). I had lived for 2 years in Germany back in 2007 (not in Berlin, although I had been there before), so I took the lead of the expedition; I located the place on Google Maps and told the guys to just follow me - which they did.

Worth reminding there was another Brazilian guy who was travelling by himself in our group, and he *kinda* objected to where we were going. But I wanted to impress my foreign buddies “I’m almost German, I’ve been here before, I know what I’m doing, trust me!”, so I *kinda* shut him off. Sorry, dude.

We walked for a while and got a tram for about 30 minutes (which was looking suspicious, as the place wasn’t supposed to be that far). After getting out of the tram and walking a couple of kilometers, we got to our destination – there we found…… NOTHING! Only a completely shut building. Either the place on Google Maps was misnamed, or I made some mistake (which may be more likely I guess). I have no idea…

At first, we were confused… but I realized my fuck-up almost immediately, and I’m pretty sure they did as well.

“Oh, uuh, the “place” must be this house, and it’s closed… oh well, tough luck…”, someone may have said...

Thankfully they were quite nice – or as nice as you can be – with the fact that a total stranger led them to fuck-away from every and anything remotely worth seeing in Berlin; and even though it was quite obvious I took'em to the wrong place, no one acknowledged that fact (out loud), and they all just kinda agreed that “the place was closed” - maybe because they didn’t want to embarrass me? Idk...

It was a long way back to the hostel. Later on they they’d go visit some other place, but this time I declined the invitation (if there was one… don’t remember really).

To this day, I cringe so hard when I remember this event.. The arrival, the emptiness there, everyone already tired, the obvious looks of frustration, the way back… oh, how the way back sucked.…

Anyway… sorry I made you guys lose a day in Berlin. At least the tram ride was fun…?

"TIFU by looking around a bit too much in my moms room So this didn't happen today, but around the summertime, so think around July. There is a few things that I should explain, I am a male, but not exactly the straightest cookie, but I can't find the best thing for what I feel. I should also mention that I am insanely curious, but also at that age where people become extremely horny, (this will become sort of important later), I should also say that my mom is one of those people who are tough, yet you somehow can't stay mad at. I was also looking for a Halloween ""costume"" to wear, although I would also use it for a story I was writing as sort of a basis for event.

With all of that out of the way, I had been going around the house, looking for things to create this costume I wanted, I went through all the boxes and things to go to thrift store, there I found a top for what I needed. Now all I needed was a bottom, but referring to the curious part of the above, I decided to go into my moms room, I knew that there was a few things there that I would be needing, now I should say that none of the stuff I took was worn all that much due to the pandemic, so I got some leggings and shoes from the closet, I decided to snoop around a bit more, and at some point came to the drawer right next to my moms bed. Now I should say, that this drawer, I though contained a flashlight and some other emergency equipment, I had seen it open before when I was younger. I opened the drawer, not expecting much, and right there, I saw a butt plug, I could have guessed that some of the fabric had parted to expose it, but there it was. I stupidly decided to open it further, and Bam!, there was a dildo, right on top of some of the fabrics, that would turn out to be some, well very exposing clothes. I then decided it would be a good idea to dig further, I found a vibrator, and tons of lube, some of it had leaked, it was a slippery, gooey mess, and then there was a paddle with the text of ""Attitude Adjuster!"", I had seen this before in the time when I was younger. So you want to know what I decide to do, not close it and back away, but take it away to my room to experiment with them. I didn't ever do anything with them, and eventually returned them, but I would occasionally get really horny and want to get that dick back out for some more play. Oh wait, there was also some handcuffs that I took for the costume to go around my wrist, just both on one, but thats not exactly important. But this just sort of ruined my image of my mom, I couldn't just look at her the same knowing that she may have played around with this stiff, slimy dick in her younger years, and possibly now. The thought of her kinky times always just scared me, but I never expected that she would have these sort of things.

TL;DR: I went around looking for some cross dressing costume, and found my moms kinky toys

Edit: I just want to clear things up, I never used them, considered it, but never actually did it, also I made damn sure to take pictures of the scene to make sure I put them back where they were, so I really dont want my mom to find out, the handcuffs were at the back and there has been no suspicion, I am currently considering to return them, but I haven't gotten a chance yet.",1,"['tifu', 'by',

"TIFU by failing school I  know no-one will read this... but..

&amp;#x200B;

I was taking K-12 online school, and apparently I've failed half way through the year. Here's a 'reason' as to why.

My birthday was in November, so I didn't do any work that day. then the work kind of got piled up. I was still doing it but it didn't seem like real work because it was online. By December I had 10 over-due assignments, I got most of them done but wanted a beak, so I took a day off. Because I was doing the work quickly, my grades took a tole. Once the end of December rolled around I noticed that the assignments were closing, meaning that I couldn't retry or even view them anymore, but it did mean they were no longer overdue. I thought having closed assignments left undone wouldn't lower my grades even further, I was wrong. I'm only half way though the year and already failed. I don't really know who is at fault or what to do. If anyone can reply to this and tell me what to do, I would be eternally grateful.

"TIFU by paying someone for a hookup and almost getting scammed I’m 21, my mental health is tanking, and in an act of desperation to try and find some social satisfaction, I tried resorting to dating apps to try and snatch hookups. Earlier today I posting an ad and got a response. They agreed to meet up but wanted me to pay $100 for things like gas and stuff cuz they were gonna be in charge of the logistics. So after fumbling around I paid them the $100 but then they insisted that I pay $200 more for “security reasons”. I then said that they were trying to scam me and I blocked them before I could fall into their trap. And now I feel ever so stupid because I let my desperation for attention and pleasure as a result of my crippling loneliness get the better of me and I literally paid the price for it.

"TIFU by Mistakenly going out in the cold, underdressed and without mask. I ordered pizza on Dominoes, but I didn’t pay online. I thought I could give the driver my aunt’s debit card when he delivers because I didn’t have enough cash. I was told to pay online, I was like nope. I’ve ordered pizza before. 

So, I went to the lobby with no mask (mistake one) and a hoody and sweatpants—nothing under (mistake 2). I thought It would be a minute transaction like usual. The man said he wasn’t going to take my card. I had to pay him online or give cash. I searched up Dominoes customer service, they told me to call my branch. My dumbass didn’t know it would be on my receipt. 

I ran out of the lobby, I forgot to get a mask and it was fucking cold. No jacket, no socks, no clothes except hoody and sweatpants. I was freezing. 

I ran crazily to the stores and Deli, they weren’t doing cash back even if I bought something. Then I entered the 4th deli and looked everybody was wearing a mask. And I touched my face—No Mask! Everybody even the cops and they were looking at me. Now, I got scared because I’m not eighteen, I have no mask, and that wasn’t my debit card, and this is NY. 

I just started rambling and telling my life story, God then The cop finally waved me over and let me go. And I asked the 4th store deli man for cash back. He said nope but there was an atm sort of thing in the back. He laughed and said, they were gonna take mad money from me. Now the cop was laughing and some man was laughing too. My phone internet stopped working when I went in and I didn’t know the debit pin.  Also, I wasn’t gonna be charged $3 or more to cash small money. I almost peed myself. Even the store wasn’t warm enough. 

I had to leave and go outside, looking for internet service and I asked someone for the Dominoes branch. They said look at my receipt. I got so mad. Called, Then the dominoes agent asked me for my zip code and I said 4 wrong zip codes. She kept on saying it wasn’t working, I kept looking around at the cop inside. I wasn’t tryna go to jail for debt card theft. Jail documentaries and movies really scared me. So, I searched google map for my address and got my zip code. Thank God for google map. 

Everything worked out but my uncle caught me outside when I was going home, with no mask, and I didn’t tell him I left his house. He wasn’t pleased. He just sent me home. Got yelled at, and we know when he tells my mom, she’s gonna finish my butt cuz she’s  an essential worker and all and she taught me better. 

So, now I’m home, in trouble and feeling slightly sick. I just hope that pizza is good, unless I’ll cry in the bathroom. 

TL;DR: went out without mask while under dressed to pay for pizza. Card was not accepted, found no cash back near me. got caught by uncle, got laughed at by cop, deli man, and random dude, almost peed my pants and froze to death.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'mistakenly',

"TIFU by placing the helmet on the fuel tank instead of wearing it on my head while driving a bike So I was casually roaming and wandering the streets of the city where I live, enjoying the ambience and architecture of the city buildings, malls, villas and houses and feeling the glory of city lights during the night (I roam this way whenever I get bored).

I was wearing the helmet while I was driving on the main road and took it out and put it on the fuel tank whenever I entered a lane or a street. It was a few minutes before the incident I switched from the main road to the street that leads to my home. The street was empty with all the stores closed and the helmet was on the fuel tank guarded in between my hands holding the bike handle. I was about to make a left turn into a lane at the end of which I will reach my home. Since there were no people around I decided not to decelerate the bike and make the turn. And when I was tilting the bike handle towards left to make the turn the helmet was blocking the tilt and I was unable to make enough tilt to make the turn. With the slight tilt and the excess speed, the bike along with me got bumped into a wall across the street. I was left with few few injuries and bruises. The bottom-line is that do not put anything on the fuel tank while driving a bike.

"TIFU by getting drunk before flying home from Mexico Obligatory this happened a little over a year ago, but here we go:

Rewind to November 2019, I'm flying home from Mazatlan with my best friend. We were looking at a long flight home with a 2 hour layover at LAX before flying back to WA. I had been drinking before the taxi picked us up from the resort, at the Mazatlan Airport having 2 margaritas, as well as several drinks on the plane. 
Fast forward, we land in LAX and stop at the bar for some drinks while we wait for our plane. Had 2 mojitos, I think? Things are kind of blurry at this point. We board out last flight from LAX back to Washington and I order one final shot of crown. At this point I was wasted. And what happens when you are wasted? You have to pee. 
I wander into the bathroom at the front of the plane, just past 1st class, drop my sweats and start the empty the tank. 
Now here is where I fucked up. 
I vape, and I carry my vape with my in my pocket so it doesn't leak in my purse. 
Without even thinking, just being drunk on a plane, I take THE FATTEST rip off my mod and blow it straight up into the smoke detector. 
*fire alarm intensifies*
BEEP BEEP BEEP 
*BANGS ON DOOR, ""MA'AM??*

I realize what I have done, open the door with my pants around my ankles and a cloud of peachy blueberry shame comes out, and all I can say to the flight attendant staring at me is, ""it's perfume??""

This was the worst walk of shame back to my seat y'all. I thought the flight marshal was going to cuff me then and there. 
I get back to my seat and the flight attendant confiscated my mod which I handed over willingly as I was sobbing. I thought I was going to get arrested. 
I cry myself to sleep, and wake up once we land. I wake up in a blur hoping it was a bad dream, only to find that we had to exit on the tarmac. Surprisingly as I exited the same flight attendant that took my mod gave it back to me and I reluctantly took it back, saying I was going to get rid of it as soon as I got home. 
Exiting on the tarmac there were two cops waiting for me. They gave me two options, wait to see if the airline would fine me, or give them my information and they would detain me. 

I waited for a fine, and for whatever reason never got one. I got lucky, and to this day am not on any no fly list that I know of. 

Don't get drunk on a plane, and if you do, keep your vaping products away from your drunken self.

Drunkenly vaped on a plane unintentionally because I forgot where I was, got my vape confiscated and landed on the tarmac where I was greeted my 2 cops  who almost detained me",1,"['tifu', 'by',

"TIFU by constantly shouting rape in a foreign country Obligatory didn't happen today, but it's one of those fck ups I always have to chuckle about when thinking about it.

So about 2 years ago I lived a few months in a city in the mountains of Vietnam. I've made some local friends my age (one of whom is called Hiệp) and we had lots of fun spending time together. Now they have this thing in their culture, where they really don't want to embarrass someone else by e.g. pointing out a mistake they are making.

Another important thing to keep in mind is that in Vietnam, depending on your voice the meaning of a word can change. And it can change dramatically. Since it's not the same for my mother tongue, I didn't really give it too much attantion.

I think you can imagine where this is going.

So in one of the last weeks I spent there, some friends tried to tell me in a really polite way, that I might want to watch how I pronounce my friends name ""Hiệp"", because I always spell it ""Hiếp"" (go find the difference...) and that basically means rape in Vietnamese.... When they told me I didn't know if I should be embarrassed or laugh, but the only thing that went through my head were all the moments I called my friend. In the supermarket, in restaurants, bars, with his family, etc.... I CONSTANTLY SHOUTED RAPE in public and no one felt the need to correct me until the very last moment. I appreciate their politeness and I still wonder what other people thought about me when they heared me calling my friend.

I was never really sure if they trolled me or not, but I finally looked it up and apparently they didn't.

"TIFU by taking a morning walk and looking stupid Okay so my husband is out of town right now and it’s just me at home. My sleep schedule is kind of a mess when he’s gone and so I couldn’t even fall asleep until about midnight last night. I woke up just after 3am after having a nightmare and I couldn’t fall back asleep after that. 

Well I decided to take a shower and relax for a bit but I have really been wanting to work out since I haven’t been to the gym for months now (cause of our good friend rona...). So I decided to go for a nice walk down to the grocery store and back which is about a two mile walk, perfect for sleepy me! I live right outside of a Capital city and that typically means there’s a lot of fun characters looming around at night and it’s best to be safe when it’s dark outside. I dressed in baggy sweats and a loose hoodie which I had the hood pulled up and scrunched on so that nobody could tell I am a young easily beaten and robbed scrawny gal. If it were during the day I wouldn’t have gone through the effort but it was almost 6am and still completely dark outside and I was very comfy like that. 

So I get walking and it was a great brisk morning!! I was totally vibing to my music and just having a wonderful time waking up. Well when I get towards the store I came across the first person I had seen. He was just some average guy and I didn’t think much of it. As I got closer I pulled up my mask from my chin to over my nose and mouth just to be considerate and safe. Well it was chilly outside and the mask made my glasses fog up so much that I couldn’t see anything. 

Next thing I know I run smack dab right into one of those cord things connected to a power pole. I half way spun around and almost fell down and it nearly knocked off my glasses. I made a very loud “ACKKK” sound and stammered off to the side of the sidewalk to collect myself and let the guy pass. When I took my glasses off and got the fog off and looked back up I noticed that he has passed 5 LANES TO THE OTHER SIDE JUST TO AVOID ME. Note that we were very close to a stop light so he could have crossed earlier but only did so after seeing my debacle. He just saw this random dark figure run right into a pole and yell and he was like “nope” and dipped. I was SO embarrassed I wanted to yell after him and say i’m not on drugs i’m fine but omg I died a little inside after that. I know it’s not the biggest FU but man was I embarrassed lol. Other then that it was a wonderful walk and I am probably going to make it a recurring thing!! 

TL;DR: I went on a morning walk dressed like a creeper and ran right into a pole and freaked out a guy probably making him think I was super drugged up or something",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'taking',

"TIFU by getting a condom stuck in my ex girlfriends ass So, this happened maybe 20 or so years ago. Met this girl at work and we hit it off. Always all flirty around each other and after a little while, she invited me to her place. I went over and we started drinking and watching TV. Started fooling around and made our way to the bedroom. I was pretty plastered but at one point I asked her if she took it in the ass. I'd never banged anybody in the ass before but figured what the hell. So, I put a condom on and she proceeded to straddle me while I was laying down. I don't remember anything after that really. Apparently during, I passed the fuck out and my hard on went away. When she got off of me, because I didn't have a boner anymore the condom slid off when my johnson slid out and left the condom in her ass. Apparently she had to dig around for it and pull it out. She told me the next morning. So yeah, that was embarrassing. We were together for about 3 or 4 years afterwards.  
TL:DR: Went to chicks house. Got plastered drunk. Started banging her in the ass and I passed out, thus leaving the condom in her ass to fish out.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'getting', 'condom', 'stuck', 'in', 'my', 'ex', 'girlfriends', 'ass', 'so', 'this', 'happened', 'maybe', '20', 'or', 'so', 'years', 'ago', 'met', 'this', 'girl', 'at', 'work', 'and', 'we', 'hit', 'it', 'off', 'always', 'all', 'flirty', 'around', 'each', 'other', 'and', 'after', 'little', 'while', 'she', 'invited', 'me', 'to', 'her', 'place', 'went', 'over', 'and', 'we', 'started', 'drinking', 'and', 'watching', 'tv', 'started', 'fooling', 'around', 'and', 'made', 'our', 'way', 'to', 'the', 'bedroom', 'was', 'pretty', 'plastered', 'but', 'at', 'one', 'point', 'asked', 'her', 'if', 'she', 'took', 'it', 'in', 'the', 'ass', ""i'd"", 'never', 'banged', 'anybody', 'in', 'the', 'ass', 'before', 'but', 'figured', 'what', 'the', 'hell', 'so', 'put', 'condom', 'on', 'and', 'she', 'proceeded', 'to', 'straddle', 'me', 'while', 'was', 'laying', 'down', ""don't"", 'remember', 'anything', 'after', 'that', 'really', 'apparently', 'during', 'passed', 'the', 'fuck', 'out', 'and', 'my', 'hard', 'on', 'went', 'away', 'when', 'she', 'got', 'off', 'of', 'me', 'because', ""didn't"", 'have', 'boner', 'anymore', 'the', 'condom', 'slid', 'off', 'when', 'my', 'johnson', 'slid', 'out', 'and', 'left', 'the', 'condom', 'in', 'her', 'ass', 'apparently', 'she', 'had', 'to', 'dig', 'around', 'for', 'it', 'and', 'pull', 'it', 'out', 'she', 'told', 'me', 'the', 'next', 'morning', 'so', 'yeah', 'that', 'was', 'embarrassing', 'we', 'were', 'together', 'for', 'about', 'or', 'years', 'afterwards', 'tl', 'dr', 'went', 'to', 'chicks', 'house', 'got', 'plastered', 'drunk', 'started', 'banging', 'her', 'in', 'the', 'ass', 'and', 'passed', 'out', 'thus', 'leaving', 'the', 'condom', 'in', 'her', 'ass', 'to', 'fish', 'out']",tifu by getting condom stuck in my ex girlfriends ass so this happened maybe 20 or so years ago met this girl at work and we hit it off always all flirty around each other and after little while she invited me to her place went over and we started drinking and watching tv started fooling around and made our way to the bedroom was pretty plastered but at one point asked her if she took it in the ass i'd never banged anybody in the ass before but figured what the hell so put condom on and she proceeded to straddle me while was laying down don't remember anything after that really apparently during passed the fuck out and my hard on went away when she got off of me because didn't have boner anymore the condom slid off when my johnson slid out and left the condom in her ass apparently she had to dig around for it and pull it out she told me the next morning so yeah that was embarrassing we were together for about or years afterwards tl dr went to chicks house got plastered drunk started banging her in the ass and passed out thus leaving the condom in her ass to fish out,tifu by getting condom stuck in my ex girlfriend as so this happened maybe 20 or so year ago met this girl at work and we hit it off always all flirty around each other and after little while she invited me to her place went over and we started drinking and watching tv started fooling around and made our way to the bedroom wa pretty plastered but at one point asked her if she took it in the as i'd never banged anybody in the as before but figured what the hell so put condom on and she proceeded to straddle me while wa laying down don't remember anything after that really apparently during passed the fuck out and my hard on went away when she got off of me because didn't have boner anymore the condom slid off when my johnson slid out and left the condom in her as apparently she had to dig around for it and pull it out she told me the next morning so yeah that wa embarrassing we were together for about or year afterwards tl dr went to chick house got plastered drunk started banging her in the as and passed out thus leaving the condom in her as to fish out,tifu by get condom stuck in my ex girlfriend ass so thi happen mayb 20 or so year ago met thi girl at work and we hit it off alway all flirti around each other and after littl while she invit me to her place went over and we start drink and watch tv start fool around and made our way to the bedroom wa pretti plaster but at one point ask her if she took it in the ass i'd never bang anybodi in the ass befor but figur what the hell so put condom on and she proceed to straddl me while wa lay down don't rememb anyth after that realli appar dure pass the fuck out and my hard on went away when she got off of me becaus didn't have boner anymor the condom slid off when my johnson slid out and left the condom in her ass appar she had to dig around for it and pull it out she told me the next morn so yeah that wa embarrass we were togeth for about or year afterward tl dr went to chick hous got plaster drunk start bang her in the ass and pass out thu leav the condom in her ass to fish out
"TIFU by having sex toy wipes delivered to my elderly ex-landlady's house. I (22F) ordered 3 packs of sex toy wipes from Lovehoney as my fiance and I had ran out. The account was first made when I was a uni student living as a lodger with a 78 year old lady and was single and ready to mingle.. They were supposed to be delivered on 23rd December, however post arrives today and still no sight. I check the tracking and realise they have been delivered, to the house I used to lodge in. 

Me and the landlady have a friendly relationship but this was a new intimacy I didn't want. I sent her a quick text saying that a parcel arrived for me and would she mind forwarding it on, I would cover postage etc. She replied almost instantly to say she opened the parcel as there was no name (old people), and that the fancy wipes looked like a nice sample selection for her 2 year old grandson so she had given them to her son and his children for Christmas. I am MORTIFIED. 

The wipes themselves only say toy and body wipes on, but it is written underneath a huge Lovehoney logo. I used to babysit for her son and daughter in law and am truly horrified by the fact they will 99% think their elderly mother has bought them some sex wipes for their young children. 

My ex landlady is transferring me the money and I have told her that she ought to let her son know they were meant for me, as I doubt he will be able to recover if he thought that of his mum. Meanwhile, I am deleting her address from any and all accounts as quickly as I can.

EDIT: I panicked and said the wipes are not something you would give to your grandchild and are an adult gift, so she is fully aware of their intention now.

"Im going to get married but it makes me depressed Im scheduled to get married in a month. Short relationship, I find him nice and soulmatey. 

Am still 25 and have a meltdown for two weeks after decided to get married, following by huge amount of anxiety. Now I am very cranky to be honest. 

I dont know, doesnt feel like the relationship is bad or toxic, but it makes me feel depressed every time i have to deal with the fact that we are going to get married. 

I dont know if its the financials, the small apartement we share, or am I just tired having him around like I could really have a break. 

Sometimes I cant event look him in the eyes, because im just so tired of the presence it pissed me off.

Edit : 
Thank you everyone for your kind words. Yes sadly I admit the 'fuck it lets get this done' strategy was not the best lol. Im living on the country where girls my age got asked alot why havent we married yet. We were fine as a couple, spending good times together for the last 4 month and continuing in lockdown, but both family (yes mine included) is pushing for us to bond into marriage ASAP. I live in the kind of country where living together with your fiance is actually kind of illegal, that considered, maybe why both families keep push us to get married soon.

"TIFU by not referring to a child as a king. Obligatory note that this actually happened a while ago, and I'm just posting it today.

I work at a print shop.  I sit at the front desk and do graphic design by appointment, or take walk-ins if I'm not busy.   On that day a large woman came in towing three young kids, no appointment, and (with no warning) started to dictate to me what she wanted on her son's birthday invites.  While this is rude, it's not uncommon, so I let her talk, started taking notes, and we got to talking about her son's likes and interests.  He's turning 5, and the whole time, talking about his favorite Power Rangers, but his Mom was having none of that and kept asking me to use Paw Patrol.  This is fine.  I have a rather limited selection of licensed and branded artwork, but if she can't just settle for generic graphics or pay for me to make something special for her son, so be it.  We finally got art style settled, and then she starts writing down the text.  The writes the kid's name as ""Miking.""  This is where TFU happened.

Now... how would you pronounce that name?  I didn't think twice about it.  I'm pasty-white with some Nordic ancestry, so I just started talking, pronouncing it like ""viking"" but with an M.  The woman interrupts me mid-sentence, and is apparently shocked. **SHOCKED** that I would so *boldly* mispronounce her kid's name.  She then spent about 20 minutes trying (and failing) to get me to refer to her toddler as ""My King"" before giving up and leaving without purchasing the invites, leaving me to explain to the boss why she sat for 20 minutes and ended up not buying anything.

"TIFU by mixing up the names of two indian co-workers who are 20 years apart. TL;DR: I have 3 indian co-workers, and I referred to one by the name of the other in front of everyone on a Zoom call.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like such a typical ignorant white coworker right now.

I have three indian coworkers at my office.

Bob - 40 year old guy

John - 25 year old guy

Daniel - 25 year old guy

So, on a team meeting Zoom call which included John, Daniel and a few other members of the team, I was telling Daniel about how Bob was working on some files for me.

In the process of doing this, I had referred to Bob as John, and obviously they are distinctly different due to their big age gap alone. Nevertheless, I ended up being \*that\* guy who can't tell POC apart at the office, and I did it on a team meeting Zoom call.

I am a year in working here, and Bob and John (who's names I mixed up) are both the two most recent people I have begun to work with, so I think that is partly why I mixed up the names.

I also happened to have my eyes reading over John's name when I was talking about Bob, so I think I just had that extra influence to make the mix up.

The worst part is that there was already a guy notorious for making this mistake with Daniel and another Indian guy from a separate department, and he was always chided for it behind his back. Welp looks like now thats me.

When it happened, Daniel had begun to hint at my mistake and I quickly and kind of casually corrected myself and continued on to try to not make a big deal about it, but I still know it was noticed.

I'm not sure if I should text John and apologize for the mix up that he witnessed in my and Daniel's conversation.

"I fucked up at the turning point of my life and now I'm getting anxiety attacks My dad's served in the army for 30 years so I'm accustomed to this lifestyle and have had a special admiration for this job. However, I spent most of my teenage as overweight and late teenage as obese. Thus, I had thought that the army isn't for me. But in December of 2019, I suddenly got this drastic urge of joining the army. I reduced 100 lbs in the last 11.5 months and appeared the exam to join the academy. I was selected but was told to appear and give the Physical Association Test again as I failed the long jump. Today was my PAT retest and I failed the long jump again. I have been told to go again on 23rd January but this will be my last chance. However, after today I have lost all my confidence and become completely demoralised and feel like I won't be able to do it. I can't sleep nor can I share this with anyone.

"TIFU by drinking $600 worth of booze. I lost my Uncle this past fall. He was the odd duck of the family and I loved him very much, we had lots in common. He introduced me to many of the things I love to do.

He was a high paid Lawyer and was terrible with money. The rest of my family is poor, so I grew up hearing tales of his monetary misdeeds. For example, he used his bonus one year to buy a condo in Key West only to lose it because he didn't pay his taxes. He was so bad at adulting he never had a phone line for long because he'd forget to pay the bill, so his company gave him a cell phone that they paid for (unheard of at that time) The company he worked for loved him for his work. There are many other stories, but on to the TIFU.

I asked by my Mother if I wanted any of his books from his summer bungalow (not as grand as it sounds, more of a higher-end trailer park. you own the house, but pay a lot fee and get to have a beach house with on Long Island but not pay 1m plus for it) I could not let books go to the dumps so I went with her with a ton of bags and filled my truck. She told me to take anything I wanted or else it will go in the dumpster so the place can be empty when they sell it. Most of the non-book related stuff was junk. I found some great pictures that I kept and a few other odds and ends.

One of those odds and ends is the heart of the TIFU. It was a smallish red box with a brass plaque. It has a small bottle of booze inside. I should have known it was not a normal bottle of booze because it was in a glass case with some other beach themed bricka brack. So fast forward last night, I pull out the box and after a hard day, I think I'd give it a try. I'm not much of a drinker, I'll have a glass of scotch every few months but that is about it. No beer or wine unless I use it for cooking. My lack of experience with alcohol comes in to play here.

I sit down get out two glasses (one for the wife, it's good to share) crack open the case, and pour us each a little taste. That first sip was when I knew I had fucked up. It was way too smooth, like zero burn at all. I finished my glass and but the supplies glass (spoiler, it's not glass) stopper in the top to save the rest for later.

As I'm sitting there letting the warmth radiate out from my belly, I grab my phone to see if I can find more of this excellent booze. I think I've just added one more thing that I can accredit my Uncle for turning me onto. I just drank a $600 dollar Louis XIII Cognac. I start freaking out. I frantically search hoping to find out that please god let this not be what came up on the search. Yeah nope. Even the empty crystal bottle and case sells for over $100 bux on ebay. There are so many things that I would rather spend $600 on than a drink. I even had a nightmare about it last night.

And that's how things went when you were my Uncle. A $600 bottle of booze hidden among the junk. Thanks for one last wild ride Uncle.

"I Taught My Little Brother a Lesson After He Came Out as Trans The little shit sat me down and told me. He said “I feel like I am a woman in the body of a man”.

 I just got up and walked out of his room. He was confused but I came back in with meat cleaver and he started shrieking as I grabbed him and held him down. I pulled his pants down and raised my cleaver. I said “You wanna be a girl. You REALLY wanna be a girl?

"I once beat the hell out of my paternal uncle, and I'm not sorry. I'm a 38 year old woman and this incident happened when I was 24. My uncle, my dad's younger brother is a misogynistic piece of shit.  He often cat calls women and gets mad when they don't open their legs for him. He does this even though he's married. Any woman who has been raped was ""asking for it"". A woman who pursued higher education, or had a high powered job was ""going to end up an old maid"". A woman asserting herself was automatically a bitch in his mind. When I was growing up, he had often bullied me for being interested in martial arts, comic books etc because ""that's for boys"". He would often ask ""are you trying to be a boy?"" and the other family members, including my own parents would laugh as if it was a joke. And don't even get me started on his homophobia.  


14 years ago , I was attending university to get my Master's degree while working.  My uncle's friend's son attended the same college.  He had asked me out several times but I always turned him down. At times he would get on my nerve as he wouldn't take no for an answer and i had to tell him to fuck off. My uncle kept insisting that I give him a chance. 


One day , my uncle invited me to his place on the pretext of helping my aunt with something. When I got there , my aunt wasn't there but the guy who had been pursuing me was. My uncle laughed like he had played this awesome prank and told me I needed tone alone with the guy ""so I'd see how great he is"". For a second interview froze , but then flight or fight kicked in and I ran out of the house. My uncle yelled at me to come back. 


The creep (the guy who had been pursuing me) ran out after me. He caught up to me but I had already taken the pepper spray out of my purse. I sprayed him right in the eye. Then I went to a police station and filed a complaint. 


I later found out that the guy had filed an assault complaint against me too. But in the past several woman had accused him of inappropriate behavior,  the cops didn't take any action against me. The university was notified of his attempt to assault me and he was kicked out. 


My uncle was livid when this happened and came to my apartment to confront me. He told me I had ruined an innocent man. That I was a ""tease who leads men on"". He told me that ""too much education had ruined me"". At the time I was so ready dealing with a lot of shit and I fucking lost it. I yelled at my uncle and asked if he had been paid by the guy to set me up with him. I asked if he was planning to whore me out. 


He said something like ""disrespectful bitch"" to me. And that's when I landed the first blow. My fist connected with his nose and blood began to pour out of it. I didn't stop. I kept on hitting him. He tried to hit back but I was way quicker. I've been an avid kick boxer since my teenage years ago have also had training in Jiu Jitsu.  So that gave me an edge. And of course, I was being powered by pure rage. 



I kept raining down kicks and punches on that pathetic excuse for a human being and it felt good. So good. I think I kept on beating him for over 10 minutes. He landed a few blows on me too but in those moments, I was unfazed. I was determined to teach that piece of garbage a lesson he would never forget. Every shitty thing he had ever said and done to me kept replaying in my mind. My knuckles were soon painted red and his face was sore and bruised. I kicked him in the knee cap many times and I did some serious damage. 


By the time I was done,  he was on the floor holding his bloody nose (I later found out it was broken). He whined , called me every name in the book and made several failed attempts to get up.  When he finally did get up, I told him to go wash off his blood and get the fuck out and to never come to my place again. He did. 


I knew he wasn't going to press charges , as that would mean admitting that he was beaten bloody by a girl. The sexist asshole would rather die than let that happen. I don't think he ever told anyone about it. The only person I've told about this is my boyfriend.  Thankfully,  the building is lived in wasn't too populated and I didn't have any immediate neighbors who could hear the commotion. 



Ever since then my uncle goes out of his way to avoid me.

"TIFU by leaving work early     This happened about 20 minutes ago. I always go into work for 8 or at least I try to anyways. I work in government buildings and so today I forgot my keys and ended up showing up later than usual which is no big deal because of the recent lockdown there's nobody in there anyways. 

    A coworker was in the building earlier than usual and I had made a joke asking her if I work today because there's nobody in the building and my job literally requires people to be in the building. She assured me that I do work today however because nobody is going to be there (besides the odd 1 or 2 people) I could just do a quick inspection and clean and leave early. So I do.

    I'm on my way home and who do I see pulling into the coffee place down the street from me? My boss. Alright no big deal guy is just getting a coffee hope he doesn't see me. 

    Anyways I get to the apartment building where I temporarily reside and who pulls into the driveway? None other than my boss of course. 

    Well shit. I'm fucked. So I ""accidentally"" drop the car garbage I was carrying and squat down to pick it up behind a parked car where he can't see me and wait for him to pass by. 

    I ended up calling him and telling him it was me and that I had scheduled a doctor's appointment for this time and that I had taken my break early to attend it (can't go into the doctor's office and the place I work at doesn't have internet). Viable excuse. 

    He thought it was me but didn't think anything of it so I basically ratted myself out for no reason. So I guess I'm taking my hour break and heading back to work.

TL;DR
    I decided to leave work early and my boss ended up seeing me in the parking lot of the apartment building I live at so I had to make up a huge lie of why I was home ratting myself out.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'leaving', 'work', 'early', 'this', 'happened', 'about', '20', 'minutes', 'ago', 'always', 'go', 'into', 'work', 'for', 'or', 'at', 'least', 'try', 'to', 'anyways', 'work',

"I don't fear death, I embrace it. I don't know if it's just because I'm depressed and suffer with anxiety, but the thought of ceasing to exist puts me at ease, in a way. I'm still scared of the terror and pain I might experience up to that point, but thinking about crossing the line gives me comfort. No matter how much we don't want to admit it, death is inevitable for us all, as it is for all as living things. Obviously there would be no joy in such a state, but also no sadness, pain and suffering. Things that can go to unimaginable levels that I have not experienced myself.

People tend to react negatively to suicide, but I don't understand. I'm sure everyone would've preferred for them to just get better, including them, but the world just isn't that utopic. I'd prefer them to not be forced to suffer. If that's what they want, why can't we humanely put them to sleep?

"TIFU by looking like I was trying to lure neighborhood kids. This happened yesterday and I am equal parts amused and mortified. 

I live in a very average suburban neighborhood. Kids playing in the streets, neighbors are friendly, you get the idea. 

I recently bought a beat up old pickup truck. I have a daily driver, but this truck is for Home Depot runs and the like. Personally I love it, but I have been made aware of the effect it has on people. This will become relevant soon. 

A few weeks ago a tree went down at a neighbor’s house right around the corner from my house. The tree company came and cut it into logs. It’s been sitting on the neighbor’s front lawn ever since. I have a fireplace so I’ve had my eye on the wood.  I figured If they’re not using it, I can swing by and load it in my truck to chop up. The thing is, I’ve never met these neighbors. I don’t know their names and I never see them outside. So I’ve just been sort of waiting until I happen to see somebody out front to ask about the logs. 

Fast forward to today. I’m driving by in my beat up old truck and I see a couple of kids coming out of the house. Two boys, probably 10-12 years old. Great, I figure I’ll pull over and ask if their parents are home to inquire about the wood. So I pull up on the curb. The thing is, I didn’t see them until I was almost to their house, so I guess I pulled up kind of fast. Well they must have been freaked out by my shitty pickup or my speedy maneuver or whatever because they fuckin’ bolted the second they saw me. So now I’m in a predicament because I don’t want our neighbors to see me speed up and then kids run away like I’m some kind of weirdo. So I roll down the window and say “hey are your parents home? I need to ask them a question?” They hear me (I think) but keep running. So now I’m sitting in my shitty truck, waiting to see how this plays out, when it occurs to me that I probably now look REALLY creepy because I’m pulling over fast, kids are running, and I’m yelling at them. So I decide the best move is to sit outside the house for a second to think. I figure it’s best to go knock on the door and see if mom or dad are home. So I do. Push the ring door bell. I also make sure my face is on camera so I don’t seem like some creep. The thing is nobody answers. I shrug and go home. Which is literally 4 houses away and forget the whole thing. 

Fast forward, 3 hours later, I’m cleaning up after dinner and my wife says “hey, there’s a cop car outside by your truck.” Oh no. Before I make it to the door, he knocks. Yep. You guessed it. Neighbor called to report an attempting luring of her children. Apparently they told her that “a man pulled up in an old truck and said that he has parrot and asked if we wanted to see it.” What I really said was “are your parents home?” Police officer and I had a good laugh. He went over and explained it. Neighbor feels better. Turns out I can have the logs too. 

TL:DR: rolled up on some neighborhood boys to ask about their wood and got accused of trying to lure them with an exotic bird.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'looking', 'like', 'was', 'trying', 'to', 'lure',

We were arguing about how our diets need to get better, she was saying I was jumping down her throat every time she ate something unhealthy, but I was just pointing it out so we can both get better with our diets which she agrees we need to do. Anyway I told her it’s just because we’ve been eating fast food and drinking sugary drinks too much and I care about her health, as well as mine. She said if she chooses to drink poison that’s her choice not mine to correct. Okay so this is where I majorly fucked up, I said “well it was your sisters choice to pull the trigger but we all wish someone stepped in” 

I do feel pretty bad and I understand she has a point about not making her feel bad if she wants a large Pepsi or to get a pizza. However both of ours health has not been great lately and I just want to see it change, Im not going to go into specifics but I am worried she or I might get very sick if we keep up these bad habits.

TLDR: My girlfriend told me after I corrected her eating and drinking habits that if she chose to drink poison that’s on her not me. I responded with the fact it was her sister’s choice to pull the trigger. Well I’m now sitting on the bed alone while she went somewhere after telling me to go fuck myself. Probably deserve this but I promise the argument started because I really care about her health",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'using', 'my', 'girlfriends', 'sisters', 'suicide', 'in', 'an', 'argument', 'yeah',

"TIFU by fcking up x00000 times in my life, every time I have interacted with my gran So, a bit of background: I am completely accent deaf. I have such an inability to tell accents apart, people think I'm trolling them. For non-uk people this may not make too much sense, but I used to work in a phone job where I regularly spoke to people from Birmingham and Wales, and I could not tell the accents apart, they always assumed i would know who I was speaking to because of the accents but nope, not even the slightest clue. I can't hear the difference between American and English. Sometimes I can tell if I hear them together, but I can only really tell they're different not which is which.

So today, my husband and I were talking about my (scottish) grandmother, the conversation then moved to him saying something along the lines of
""Have you ever noticed how older people don't lose the accents of their birthplace as much as younger people seem to?"" I looked at him confused, we were just talking about my gran who sounds as English as I do ""but my gran doesn't sound Scottish anymore"" and he just.. gave me this look.. and then burst out laughing ""you can tell she is Scottish by the first syllable of her speaking"". 

I am almost 28. I have heard my gran speak for 28 years and always just thought she'd lost her accent because she's lived in England so long. If I didnt know she was Scottish, I never would have known because, to me, she had so little of an accent. 

But turns out she is very very Scottish and my accent deafness is even worse than I thought. 

Now when people talk on TV, my husband keeps telling me everyone is Scottish and I genuinely don't know when he is joking or not 😂

Its hilarious, really, that I am so accent deaf when my husband is a voice actor. Well...hilarious for me. Endlessly unhelpful for him hahaha.

Take that, Alanis - THAT'S irony.

"TIFU By Repeatedly Saying The Wrong Word During An Important Meeting I’m currently doing a co-op at this one company. Most of my work is just typing up documents for my employer and other companies as means of what’s currently happening. Basically just updating everything step by step. My supervisor thought it’d be a great idea for me to run the meetings, which isn’t bad it’s just reading words off the document. The thing was that I didn’t type this document up, my supervisor did and he’s an amazing guy but he thinks quicker than he types so there was bound to be spelling and grammar errors. 
So I’m reading along the lines of the document and fixing everything and I came across the word “simulated use.” I have no idea why I read it wrong but I repeatedly said “stimulated use.” The context makes it worse because my line was “this criteria can be found in stimulated use.” No one said anything but after the meeting my supervisor started dying of laughter. And he told me and now I’m super embarrassed.

"TIFU by my habit of leaving my clothes on the bedroom floor when I go to bed come back to ruin my drunken plan. Obligatory did not happen today or this century,  My soon to be wife would be very upset when I came home to the apartment late and especially when I was drunk. I worked nights in a restaurant so it was late by the time we finished and I’d usually prefer a drink with the gang for decompression so when I got home I’d just drop my clothes next to the bed climb in and go to sleep. On the nights that I left a bottle of wine in the fridge ‘for us when I get home’. 95% of the time I’d come home early and the wine would be gone and she’d be down and out for the night in bed. So coincidentally enough, on some of the nights I left a bottle of wine for ‘after work’ I would stay out late with the boys, not getting into any trouble, just hanging out drinking, smoking and bullshitting. If I got home after 3am, she who must be obeyed would be code red- sleep somewhere else - Mad. So if I got back to the apartment after 3 I would quickly undress in the hallway outside of the apartment, as quietly and slowly as possible I would turn the key and open the door to the apartment. If the bottle was gone I’d drop my clothes next to the bed and climb in. However if the bottle was still in the table with 2 glasses left for effect, then there was trouble…there was never any trouble. The bottle was empty when I slid in at 3:46 on the oven digital clock, I tiptoed towards the bedroom when I heard the sound of the bed springs creaking the way they do when she’s getting out of bed in the middle of the night. Anyone who’s spent any time masturbating in the living room knew that sound very well. Or maybe it was just me, anyways, the bed springs play their jewelry box ballerina chime of doom as I drop my clothes and dove for the kitchen and start to pour myself a glass of water. ‘WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU’RE DOING COMING HOME AT THIS HOUR!’
‘What are you talking about?’ I say trying to sound sleepy but just coming across as more drunk than I was. ‘I was in bed and I just got up for a glass of water.’
I was pretty sure she couldn’t argue, since I was in my underwear, and she didn’t. She just walked to my pile of clothes next to the front door and said ‘these would be beside the bed if you were in bed with me , now put them on and gtfu.’ 

TL;DR I liked to go stay out late after work but my fiancé didn’t like it, she also didn’t like how I left my clothes beside the bed on the floor every night. if I stayed out too late I would take off my clothes in the hallway just outside our apartment door so that if she woke up I would say that I just got out of bed for some water. But the first time she woke up she knew because my clothes were NOT beside the bed on the floor.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'my', 'habit', 'of', 'leaving', 'my', 'clothes', 'on', 'the', 'bedroom', 'floor',

"Tifu by almost ruining the holidays with an inappropriate picture NSFW for obvious reasons

Obligatory this didn't happen to me today but rather on Christmas morning 2020. 

It was the first Christmas my girlfriend and I really got to do it up. Our son was around 15 months old at the time so we wanted to make it really special for him. 

For fear that he would start unwrapping the brightly colored shiny boxes under the tree, we decided to stash all of the presents in a spare room we have. The plan was to wake up extra early on Christmas morning, put all the presents under the tree, and wait for him to wake up.

Well the plan went off without a hitch. We woke up super early and got everything taken care of in about 15 minutes. It is now 6:45 AM and son is still out cold. I decided to go try and lay down to catch another 20-30 minutes of sleep, and my gf wanted to wait up for the kid. 

This is where it starts to go downhill. I go and lay down, but I quickly realize that I will not be going back to sleep. So I think to myself maybe we can have a little early morning ""roll in the hay"" if you will. So I decided that I'm gonna send m'lady a dick pic.

Now I, being the mostly out of touch millennial that I am, don't use snapchat that often. But I do know that people often use it to send nudes. Therefore, I decided to channel my inner young person and take care of this with modern technology.

After a few attempts I finally got what I thought was a pretty nice dick pic. Good lighting, angle, you guys know what I'm talkin about. I then add the words ""You want some Christmas dick?"" to the snap. 

While reviewing placement of the words, I decided that it wasn't festive enough. At first I thought there might be a Christmas light sticker, but I settled on a bow.

Here is the problem with being an old millennial and almost never using snapchat. I was looking around for the button that adds a sticker to the picture. Ya know that little button in the bottom left corner that looks like a little square with a + in the corner? Well my brain was like, oh hey that looks like an add sticker button. I tapped the button and it was gone. My glorious tribute to my manhood had zoomed off to lands unknown and I had no idea where. 

Immediately I started panicking. I quickly checked my story but I didn't see anything. Then I replicated what I had done but with a picture of the wall instead. Pressed the same button and ""poof"" it was gone. I then went back to my story and.... there it was. In all of its triumphant glory. 

Luckily, the view counter still said ""0"" and luckier still, I somehow knew how to delete a snapchat from your story. Just as quickly as it had come in to this world it was taken out. 

After my heartbeat reached a semi normal rate, I decided to get back in the saddle again and re do my masterpiece. Mission successful. After a good laugh with my gf, we ended up having a nice pre Christmas morning. 

I know the view counter said 0. But I wonder if someone, who was hoping to see pictures of our son on Christmas morning, opened my story. Only to be met with a very festive dick pic. Nobody has said anything yet so I guess we will see.

And now, every once in awhile, my head will randomly say ""want some Christmas dick?"" and I burst out laughing.

Tldr: almost ruined Christmas by posting a festive dick pick to my snap story.

"TIFU by having a little to much Faith So this happened about 20 minutes ago, so I’m laying I bed late at night feeling a bit... excited. So I get completely naked and start to do my thing, after awhile I felt a bubble in my belly and decided to let it out, Fart haha, continuing in my endeavours I feel another one coming, whatever I just let it slip... it wasn’t just a fart, it was water burst, I spray shit down in a line on my bed sheets.

Embarrassed by what happened, I quickly leap into action cleaning my bed, removing every bit of bedding I can and throwing them in the washing machine, but then in my time of rushing and doing everything quickly, I woke up my brother.

He asked what happened, no way in avoiding the question of “Why are you doing laundry at 4am?”, I explained what happened and he laughs until he cries and now I’m sitting on toilet cleaning myself up and not looking forward to the next time I see my family.

"TIFU by asking my fellow campers to masterbate together. This happened about six or so years ago. I was at a summer aquatic's camp. Our Camp counselors had decided that we would all play a game together. I don't remember the name of the game, but it was in the same vain as Mafia or Among us. One of us kids was a killer and we needed to find out who it was. Being the eloquent genius that I am, I decided that I should speak up and say something witty. 

""We need to come together and contemplate!"" 

Well, that's what I had meant to say. Instead I decided to say ""We need to come together and masturbate!"" I had assumed that masturbate was a similar word to contemplate except for one key difference. Those who masterbate are masters. 

My flawed logic lead me to horrify the adult camp counselors and embarrass myself.

"TIFU by betting a million on my daughter Today my daughter and I discussed college and university during family dinner, and she was asking what would happen if she didn't get into a top college. My oldest daughter (19) got a few B's during high school, which is what my wife and I believed to be the reason why she didn't get into her dream schools. We are extremely adamant that my youngest daughter (15) gets into a top 20 school and she has been following our expectations to get in. She has been working extremely hard since she’s in honors and AP classes, but she felt like getting just all A's and a 1550 on the SAT may not be enough, but my wife and I assured her that they are. She still had her doubts, which is why I told her I would give her a million dollars if she didn’t get into a top 35 school with just these grades and even told her I would give it to her in writing. Be honest, how likely am I to lose a million dollars?

TL;DR: I told my daughter that if she got all A's during high school and a 1550 or higher on the SAT, she is guaranteed into a top 35 national university in the U.S, but she didn't believe me, so I

"TIFU by leaving oil heating up on a frying pan for too long it burst on fire English is not my first language so I apologise for any mistakes.

My mom went to work today and left some oil in a pan with a lid on top for me to heat up later so I can fry some fish for lunch.
Well online class finished early so I head on to the kitchen, turn on the stove, and lower the heat a bit and go back to my room..
Time passes for idk how much long and I go back to the kitchen. I notice there is lot of smoke coming out of the pan and I knew I left it for too long, our stove also has a tendency to raise the heat on its own.. I lift up the pan and booom fire!!
I was scared shocked and I had no idea what to do.. I knew water was a no go from all the videos I watched online of all the failures, I remembered dirt or sand but I had neither, I had no fire extinguisher.. I tried putting it down with a cloth but to no avail.. All I had left was ask for help and no one was home other than my mother's nosy aunt who lives with us, that I was not on speaking terms with... She came, picked up the pan and went outside on the balcony and somehow the fire died down?? Maybe it was the wind or it came in contact with outside air idk..
Well I thanked the aunt and proceeded to clean up the oil mess..
I'm glad I'm okay and there was no casualties but I'm super mad cause I'm sure the nosy aunt is going to tell everyone in the family how I don't even know how to cook and I'm a failure.. and my mom is going to be super disappointed in me and think what a failure of a daughter she has..

TLDR : I left a frying pan full of oil heat up for super long that it burst on fire and I had no idea how to put it down I had to resort to ask for help from a family member I was not in good terms

"TIFU Almost became a statistic of people drowned in the Kern River I went camping and river tubing to along the Kern River. The water was at most waste high in most places on the river. There are some rapids and small waterfalls along the way. I was river tubing and the river was leading to a waterfall that didn't look too bad, when suddenly the current took me in another direction towards some large boulders. Instead of going over the boulders, the water was being sucked down a crevice under the boulders.

The current pushed me in between the boulders and I got flipped off my inner tube. I was sandwiched between the boulders and my inner tube by the water. The current was so strong that it popped my inner tube and sucked it away into the boulders. Now, I was pinned against the boulders by the current of the river. I could barely move. The water was up to my neck and couldn't climb out. 

I was scared. I didn't know how long I could stand being pounded by the river with water rushing against my face. I made the decision to dive down and hopefully go through the same hole that took my inner tube. I dove down and felt my way to an opening. The current of the river shot me through the hole and out the other side. Good thing I decided to wear a life vest. After I made it out of the hole, the life vest pulled me back up to the surface of the river.

Thinking back on this incident, I'm not sure if I made the best decision. What if the opening at the bottom was too small for me to fit through? What if there was another boulder blocking the exit? The river current would have been too strong for me to get back out. I would have ended up as a +1 on the local sign in town that said. ""Kern River: 294 Lives lost since 1968.""

"TIFU by sleeping in sweatpants For Christmas yesterday I got a pair of Brandi Melville sweatpants. I’ve been wanting these for a while now so after getting them I wore them pretty much all day. We didn’t really leave the house all day so I decided to sleep in the sweatpants too because why not? Well, this morning I woke up to the feeling of lovely period cramps and knew immediately that my sweatpants were going to be destroyed. This is mostly my fault because I knew it was about to start and decided not to wear anything to bed. But alas I woke up with blood all over my brand new sweatpants. I managed to scrub out most of the blood and the pants are in the washing machine now and I’m waiting to see the extent of the damage. I’m putting all of my faith in cold water and folex.

"TIFU by taking ""you"" referring to me in a business transaction. Because of Covid and the new restrictions, the place I work has this drive-thru inspired ordering process. One door is where the orders are taken, the other serves as the pickup/outstation. 
Since it's cold, guests usually place an order and go elsewhere. So, a phone number is placed with an order, so the machine can text (that number connected to the order) once the kitchen checks it off as completed. Now, on to where I messed up.  

G is Guest
Me is My response  
[Paraphrasing will be used in the following sequence of events]. 

After placing the guest's order and number in, I went back to give his change &amp; receipt. He tipped me, I thanked him. While looking over his receipt, he goes:  

G: Are you going to text me? Or... 
Me: No, I can't! There is this thing about guests and workers, y'know... 
G: [something] my order?  
Me: Yes. For that. 

His head tilted once that was said, so I just nodded to avoid regretting more words. He didn't move or say anything after that, which caused me to take that as leave to go. 

I was walking pretty directly away from the door to let a manager know. I'm the type of worker that lets management be aware of stuff that has to do with me before someone or something else lets my actions be known, I hope that makes sense. 

The manager that was there found it more humorous than concerning thankfully! Then gave a couple of examples of how I could apologize if I was the one to give this guest their order.  
I ended up bagging his order, so I threw a couple of extra sauces in there for good measure. And when it came time to give it to him, it pretty much went with: 
 
Me: I'm sorry for what I said earlier, I didn't understand exactly what you meant.  
G: It's fine. Have a good night.
Me: Have a good night!  

Yep, that's the end of it. I told the manager that gave me advice on the matter, y'know. I didn't register what he meant partly because most guest uses the same phrase for that type of question. It's the first time, I've ever gotten a ""will you call"", it's usually"" when is the text"" or ""is it a text or call"" those type of things. I took him saying ""you"" as him addressing me instead of the business/company text he was expecting. 

TL:DR: Dude asks ""Are you going to text me?"", I said ""No..."" and started giving the rules of thumb. He was talking about his 'order ready' text. The manager gave advice, we said: ""...good night."".",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'taking', 'you', 'referring', 'to', 'me', 'in', 'business', 'transaction', 'because', 'of', 'covid', 'and', 'the', 'new',

"2020 was the best year of my life Everywhere people are celebrating the end of 2020 and understandably so but I have really struggled to get on board with the whole “fuck 2020 I can’t wait until it’s over”.

I’ve objectively had an amazing year. Everything has just seemed to fall into place perfectly.

* I started the year pursuing a bucket list dream of mine travelling the world.
* When the pandemic hit I was in a shitty job I hated in a country I didn’t want to be in anymore ans was incredibly lucky to have my contract cut short and get generous severance
* I moved back to my home country and was able to just sit at home and relax after nearly a year of travelling and working crappy jobs
* While taking a few months off I met my current girlfriend
* A job I had been due to start got postponed leading me to look for another job, where I subsequently found my dream job with better pay, and benefits, and future career progression
* My favourite sports team won the league for the first time in my life time. 
* I was able to see friends at pubs and in the park rather than going to clubs which frankly I feel I’ve grown out of. 
* My girlfriend then agreed to move in with me and we signed an amazing place at a ridiculously good price 

So I’m ending the year with moving in with my beautiful girlfriend, an amazing job that 6 months ago I didn’t know existed, more money in the bank, none of my relatives or friends have been seriously affected by Covid and a generally great outlook.

I know I’m very fortunate but honestly if 2020 had gone the way I’d planned I don’t think I’d be as happy as I am now.

"TIFU by giving my toddler a metal cup I bought the cup last week but today my poor decision came home to roost. My son is 18 months old and not overly fond of bed time. He's also got this rotten little habit of stashing his sippy cups in weird places where they end up getting smooshed. 
I was out shopping at a store with a lot of camping stuff and stumbled on a sippy cup made of metal. It's yeti-style with a plastic screw on lid. Jackpot! If this thing gets stuck under the recliner, it's not going to explode when someone sits down. 

Cue today, half hour ago. It's late and the little guy just does not want to go to sleep. We rocked him, we snuggled him, we ended up giving him the sippy cup. A few minutes into a cozy cuddle and all of a sudden...

BAM!

He swung his cup and smacked me dead center of the bridge of my nose. Then the little poop machine starts crying because when I yelled ow, it scared the hell out of him. My nose isn't broken but it's definitely going to be swollen and it hurts like hell.

"TIFU by snapping my dick during sex...on you guessed it, New Year's Eve 2020 happened on the last day of 2020. 

  fuck 2020, right? well. fucking my way into 2021 did not fare well for me...

  my on-again off-again gal sent me a text the day before seeing what was up and we agreed to shack up in lieu of all things 2020, and of course the New Year approaching. it didn't take long before we got into the sex stuff...me on top, her on bottom as usual. for context, i cannot stress the on-again off-again thing enough - we've been together (kinda) for 2.5 years, break up about as often as the wind blows (almost not kidding), and i haven't been with anyone nor has she (afaik) in this time. well, to put it plainly, sex and cuddles are the only thing we do 'right.'  i cannot stress this enough - i'm a tall dude and she's a petite gal. it's fun. we cuddle and do the lovey-dovey stuff pretty awesome as well. other than that, we suck.

  while i'm off track, lemme backtrack a sec; a little over a year and a half ago i got sober/clean. she was instrumental in this process to say the least. i never in a million years would've considered sobering up...not even after my dwi early last spring and then getting out of jail, freaking out and booking a one-way ticket to LA. i called her up, we talked, she told me to come home, i did. i was in LA 16 hours. to stay on topic (sex stuff), my health was so bad pre-sobriety...really bad, but my will to keep doing sex stuff was greater. on two different occasions during this period i was injured during sex stuff as well: 

  - passing out after sex stuff walking to the kitchen to get some water - [mild concussion/8 stitches] (https://i.imgur.com/wygy3RJ.jpg)
  - and much more serious...a micro aneurysm

yeah kids, don't do drugs. 

  so, back on track; i was on top, she was on bottom. her finishing move is getting on top of me so i hopped off and laid on my back and she got on...it took about 15 seconds of the hard riding then....

  **pop**

 she felt it, i felt it (of course), but what's really funny is that we both finished right after. no idea how i pulled that one off considering my dick just snapped. and, i never come out of her since she's so small - can't really explain why it happened. but, yeah...poor little guy is pretty sore and bruised so terrifyingly bad (pic below this post) - meet with the urologist on Monday, and one last time...

  fuck 2020 - no thanks for the covid and the broken wang, you fucker.

"TIFU by accidentally ordering Chuck E. Cheese’s for dinner Well, this happened two nights ago, but same difference. 

The other night I decided to order some quality pizza for my partner and I for dinner. I was looking for something relatively cheap, but also wanted to support a local business (rather than a big chain pizza restaurant). So, I found a place on Uber Eats called Pasqually’s Pizza. Affordable pizza, super affordable wings, sounds like it’s a small business! What a deal!

Order gets delivered quickly, arrives intact, everything is okay, until I open the pizza. Eh... pretty cheap-looking, but I guess that’s what I paid for. Then I check out the wings. They honestly sucked. I took one bite and couldn’t stomach another. 

I went online to see where this place was. Wow, that’s weird, it’s exactly where Chuck E. Cheese’s is. It didn’t take long for me to realize that Pasqually is a character from the Chuck E. Cheese universe and Pasqually’s Pizza is their internal cafe. 

We had a good laugh, I ate the crappy pizza, and learned my lesson. If the price is too good to be true, the quality is too. 

TL;DR I ordered from Chuck E. Cheese thinking it was a small business, when in actuality they branded their pizza after an obscure rat character...",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'accidentally', 'ordering', 'chuck', 'cheese’s', 'for',

"TIFU by going to the bathroom at work This afternoon I was at work (restaurant job) when I had the sudden urge to go #2. I had a waitress watch my tables and proceeded to go to the bathroom.

While I was sitting on the john scrolling reddit and taking care of business, the toilet flushed underneath me by itself (it’s motion-sensored). Some water splashed up at me which was disgusting, so I lifted up and let it flush. Again, the same thing happened a minute later. After that flush, it flushed two more times consecutively. I lifted my body up to see what was going on, and found that the toilet was clogged and filled to the BRIM OF THE SEAT. 

I freaked out and stood up, and from there it flushed again causing my business to flow out of it and all over the floor. There was a man outside of the stall at the urinal (right next to it) and he let out a “HEY” and went to the sink to wash his hands and leave. From there I scrambled to grab my shit (no pun intended) and got the hell out of there. 

I was pretty embarrassed when I left the bathroom and didn’t tell anyone. One of the line cooks walked in and yelled “WHAT THE FUCK?” and a manager was notified. I don’t think anybody knew it was me but the waitress that I asked to watch my tables gave me a strange look so there’s that.

"TIFU by lying to a bunch of strangers Yes, it’s a throwaway. This has been going on for a while, but it’s starting to get to me and I don’t know what to do. I’m not even really sure where to start to explain it. I can’t get into a lot of details, because certain things I’ve said might give me away.

A number of years ago, I quit drinking. Started going to meetings, doing everything right, blah blah blah. Things were going pretty well. One day I relapsed. And I don’t just mean had a drink and had to start over…I was working as a pizza delivery driver and I got in an accident because I had a thermal mug of Jack and Coke in the car with me while I was working.

That’s a bad enough fuckup, but that’s not why I am posting. A few months back, I discovered a sub with people who either don’t drink anymore or are trying to quit. Great for me, I’ve been there. But not only have I been claiming the day that I originally stopped drinking, but last night I was sitting there with a Red Stripe in my hand, telling somebody with a couple weeks how much better it gets.

I don’t know how to fess up. I don’t know if I should. I mean, a lot of people are getting encouragement from the things I’m saying, and I know that the things I’m saying are right. But I feel like a fraud.

"TIFU by telling my MIL she’s the reason her son has crippling depression. 
When I met my husband in our early 20’s he was the love of my life. We quickly eloped and started our life together. He changed a year later right after we got a computer. His self care became infrequent and he became depressed. He’d game up to 21 hours a day and stopped working. We went to counseling and he admitted that he’d always neglected his self care growing up, tried to get out of going to school and doing any kind of work. He said when he wanted to date he changed to be outgoing and it worked. 
The root of his problems were from being raised by a hoarder, just like the ones on TV, plus too many animals.
He has a younger brother who came out of the situation seemingly unharmed. Of anyone I’ve ever known, him and his wife have the ideal life. He can afford for her to stay home and they raised their 3 boys into great young men who are now in college. They live in a stunning spotless home and are the center of hundreds of people’s social circle. Completely involved parents, coaching, team mom, PTA, musicians, travel. Just the best people. 
My husband hasn’t much improved in the last 20 years. He receives treatment but the only situation it alleviates is his anxiety, it doesn’t make him any more productive. 
His mother is up in age and needing help with shopping, appointments and lifting. Because we live closest, that’s been our responsibility for several months.
While driving her yesterday, she was venting about how my husband isn’t as helpful as she wants him to be. She wants to go out shopping several times a week and he’s only helpful with the necessities. Then she made a comment that she thinks one of my nephews is going to turn out just like him because he’s been too busy to take her shopping to (a 4 hour round trip) Without thinking, I responded “That’s ridiculous because he was raised way better” She got wide eyed and defended herself saying that my husband was helpful before he met me, but I know that’s a lie. I saw what she raised him in when we met, and no one was doing anything in that house. I tried to backpedal and say I meant my nephew was raised by 2 parents. She then asked me if I had a problem with single mothers? We were silent the rest of the ride. 
Still waiting for the family drama but maybe she will self reflect and not tell anyone. 
TLDR My husband has severe mental illness from being raised by a hoarder. When my MIL mentioned she believes my nephew was going to be just like him, I told her it’s not possible because he has good parents.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'telling', 'my', 'mil', 'she’s', 'the',

"tifu by not saying good morning to my father  So  I'm stuck at home because of Covid, which is why I (unfortunately) run  into my father almost every morning. Now I'm not a morning person and my  throat often gets really dry overnight so that I need something to  drink. And I'm ill so every time I don't drink for an hour my throat  will feel like a goddamn grater. You can imagine what I feel like in the  morning before having my first cup of tea. The thing is my father  apparently expects me shout good morning every time I see him or some  shit as if I'd be happy to know that guy. So after several days of  mocking me for ""developing backwards"" and ""forgetting how to speak"" he  got really angry at me today for deciding to ignore him while I make my  tea. Even better after I tried to explain that my throat hurts (with a  barely audible, cracking voice cause again I'm fucking sick) he just  went ""Oh NOW she speaks!"" like me and my behaviour just somehow became  even more appalling to him than what already is the case. Needless to  say I stormed out of there and now I'm here angry, frustrated and with a  hurting throat cause I still don't have my tea. Thanks ""father""

I love the scent of the pillow and it reminds me of nap time and such. The scent is really special to me but recently the scents been gone. I can barely smell it. It just smells like nothing.

"TIFU by sticky situation with a girl I’ve know for a while Sticky situation with a girl I’ve known for a long time

Ok so the other day while me and one of my greatest buddy’s were hanging out he brought to my attention that this one girl I’ve known for a about a year who I’d consider I’m very close with was talking shit about me. At first I was very shocked when he said this and almost didn’t believe it because were so close. I still don’t understand what she thought while she did this but actually she was talking shit about me while my buddy who I mentioned earlier was in the car with her lol (they both were getting a ride from a friend from a party). Long story short she called me fake and rude. I will admit I did piss her off a couple days before this and I honestly meant it as a joke but she probably took it the wrong way(looking back at on it it was kinda rude actually). This is where I need some help. So being friends with this girl we always do stuff together and everyone assumed we were a thing but we actually weren’t I genuinely enjoyed hanging out with this girl and we were just super close (she’s funny and we both have a lot of the same interests). Well about a month we almost hooked up but we didn’t (around mid November). It was the weirdest thing. We both talked about that night together and both agreed that we almost did. Fast forward a little bit and I’ve noticed we’ve gotten even closer. We FaceTime every night and talk and text each other everyday. Now after what happened it just kinda not the same I guess. I need some help on what I should do now. I want to hook up with this girl but I’m just confused on what I should do now especially with what she said about me  

We’re both 19 
I’m male and she’s female 

TL;DR: I want to hookup with this girl I’ve know for about a year but I said something to really piss her off. What should I do?",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'sticky', 'situation', 'with', 'girl', 'i’ve', 'know', 'for', 'while', 'sticky', 'situation', 'with', 'girl', 'i’ve', 'known', 'for', 'long', 'time', 'ok', 'so',

"I reached out to a former child actor who I bullied back in school I don't want to give up his name, but yes I did bully him in middle and high school. Back then, my logic was simple. If he's being bullied then I am not. plus his family had money, lived in a nice house, had two parents and relatively drama-free home life. I was jealous. It was quite easy to bully him because he was a bit of a showoff, small and acted like he was better than everyone else. There were times when I went too far and that does haunt me. The bullying peaked in high school and it even got too much for me so I stopped partaking in it.

He got beat up pretty bad when he was in 10th grade at the bus stop. To make matters worse, they were freshman. When he came back to school, he looked like he had been in a car accident. This was before everyone had cell phone cameras and the media reporting 24/7 on anyone who was famous even for a little bit. That would have been on the web forever. His parents didn't want people to find out so no charges were pressed and they put him in a new school.

As an adult in his 30s, I have some insight into why he was the way he was and he just didn't fit in and didn't understand why. His parents failed him. They thought his bullies were his friends.

He's had some issues and blamed bullying as a cause.

I sent him an email apologizing for my role and explained why I did what I did. I said I would not be surprised and understand if he chose not to forgive me. I wanted to let him know it wasn't that something was wrong with him. If it wasn't him who was the kid who got beaten up or gum thrown in his hair or spat in their face then it would have been me.

"TIFU by grilling salmon which nearly caused our house to blow up and then scaring my cat into running away. Tldr; Family was grilling salmon on an old grille which caught fire and nearly blew up, the resulting chaos caused my cat to flee into the night and we haven't been able to find him.

My new year has admittedly not started off as I would have liked, it's been outstandingly shitty to say the least... there's some comedy involved here but honestly a new wave of sadness which is kind of overriding it so please bear with me. 

This evening my dad was grilling some Salmon on our old outside BBQ, it's a sturdy piece of equipment that we've used many times over the years and we've never had a problem with it, until today... while my dad was grilling away I was playing Wasteland 3 in the next room over I heard a loud WOOSHING sound, instinctively i turned around to see what it was and I saw a huge jet of flame that had just singed the hair clean of my dad's forearm and partially burned his hair. My dad and I both looked at each other in absolute shock for a moment before he ran in and we proceeded to make sure he was okay, turns out he was fine other than a bruised ego and a few missing hairs. I half jokingly stated that we should stay the fuck away from the grille... I wish we had never touched the damn thing in the first place. 

My dad then returned outside to make sure that the grille was okay. It was not okay. The goddamned propane tank was on fire. It's worth noting that we live in a house which is connected to another neighbors house up in the hills, if that tank had exploded it would've severely damaged not only our house but also theirs and it also could have really caused us some severe injuries. My dad starts screaming to get the fire brigade and to get water to extinguish the fire, so I sprinted up the stairs, filled up a huge jug of water and called 911 in the other hand (was rather impressed with my ability to do this while freaking the fuck out). They said they'd send the fire service right over and I just prayed to God that this would all be resolved sooner rather than later.

My family and I quickly evacuated the house and got as far away from the brewing explosion as humanly possible, we then alerted our neighbor (who probably thinks we're insane now) to the possible danger and that she should probably get her family to a 'safer' location, she's got elder relatives who live with her so now I felt like a huge asshole. The fire guys turn up and quickly extinguish the flames, but in the commotion we had left our backdoor open... this was a mistake. We have an adorable cat called K2 (he's a Himalayan blue) and he's a huge wuss, so when he heard the commotion he sprinted out the back door into the velvet backdrop of the night, out of sight and out of mind. We couldn't locate him and we still can't... we also live in an area which is full of Coyotes. So in the space of 24 hours 2021 has nearly burned my house down, blown my family and my neighbors the fuck up and possibly caused me to lose my goddamn cat...that saying about starting as you mean to go on better be absolute horseshit or I swear to God.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'grilling', 'salmon', 'which', 'nearly', 'caused', 'our', 'house', 'to', 'blow', 'up', 'and', 'then', 'scaring', 'my', 'cat',

ran in and we proceeded to make sure he was okay turns out he was fine other than bruised ego and few missing hairs half jokingly stated that we should stay the fuck away from the grille wish we had never touched the damn thing in the first place my dad then returned outside to make sure that the grille was okay it was not okay the goddamned propane tank was on fire it's worth noting that we live in house which is connected to another neighbors house up in the hills if that tank had exploded it would've severely damaged not only our house but also theirs and it also could have really caused us some severe injuries my dad starts screaming to get the fire brigade and to get water to extinguish the fire so sprinted up the stairs filled up huge jug of water and called 911 in the other hand was rather impressed with my ability to do this while freaking the fuck out they said they'd send the fire service right over and just prayed to god that this would all be resolved sooner rather than later my family and quickly evacuated the house and got as far away from the brewing explosion as humanly possible we then alerted our neighbor who probably thinks we're insane now to the possible danger and that she should probably get her family to safer location she's got elder relatives who live with her so now felt like huge asshole the fire guys turn up and quickly extinguish the flames but in the commotion we had left our backdoor open this was mistake we have an adorable cat called k2 he's himalayan blue and he's huge wuss so when he heard the commotion he sprinted out the back door into the velvet backdrop of the night out of sight and out of mind we couldn't locate him and we still can't we also live in an area which is full of coyotes so in the space of 24 hours 2021 has nearly burned my house down blown my family and my neighbors the fuck up and possibly caused me to lose my goddamn cat that saying about starting as you mean to go on better be absolute horseshit or swear to god,tifu by grilling salmon which nearly caused our house to blow up and then scaring my cat into running away tldr family wa grilling salmon on an old grille which caught fire and nearly

"The Home Depot Tune Makes Me Hard As Hardwood Flooring Every time I'm listening to Pandora or any form of media and the first plucks of the string is heard like something out of a god damn Alan Parson's Project jam I get shivers down my spine. I've even noticed profuse sweating, especially around my hinds. It's a rush of adrenaline. It has nothing to do with 2-by-4s, hammers, or baseball. It has everything to do with the sweet sonic heroin that is the Home Depot Melody. Hell, I would listen to a concert that is specifically this song and remixes of it in some sort of divine intervention. There is nothing more satisfying to me at the moment. My husbando doesn't even notice me anymore, I am enraptured by this beat. I've heard it's not rare, even common, for women to have turn ons much different than men, but this is ridiculous. I'm literally on the verge of orgasmo. If I won a Grammy, I would thank God, my family, and whatever sweaty backroom marketers wrote this jingle. It has vibes for days, or days for vibes. I have lost count. Currently quarantining with said husbando with this song on repeat playing Fall Guys. Happy New Years, bitches.

"TIFU by teaching my dog how to lick his lips Since my dog knows all of the basic commands I decided to teach him some funny or cool tricks. One of them was bang (I’m sure a lot of people know what it is) where I pretend to shoot him with my hands and he lays on his side. I was thinking of a unique one and I thought of teaching him to lick his lips. I thought it would be funny so I decided to teach him. Basically I just waited until he licked his lips for a treat then gave it. 

It took about two days to teach and he learned it pretty well. I had family come over yesterday and I showed their kids and they thought it was the funniest thing ever. My dog ended up being alone with the kids and they kept telling him to lick his lips so when I saw him again is lips were super red. I decided to bring him to the vet and by the time we got there he had chapped lips

"TIFU by getting closed out. So this is happening as I'm writing these lines.

I went over to a friend to do something on new years eve. I told my father that I come home late but I'm probably sleeping over. The evening went well, and we had a lot of fun but I decided my own bed is more comfortable than sleeping on the couch and I decided to go home after 5 a.m when the curfew is over. Now the temperature is solid below zero and the humidity makes it feel a lot colder. I get through the town in ten minutes thinking about sleeping under the blankets in a bit. I make it through our gate and I stick my keys into the hole, and... Stuck. My father left the keys in the lock. I can't get in. Now we don't realy have a doorbell and my father and my sister sleeps on the second floor where noones hears anything when I bang on the doors. Nevermind I call them. I call my father. No answer. Sis. No answer. I called them at least 5 times already and no one answers. And they won't wake up only if I scream loud enough to wake the whole neighbourhood, which I won't do. I went back to my buddies place but he doesn't answer the phone nor his doorbell. So I'm currently back at our place and I managed to break into our basement. It's still cold but at least it's not windy and the temperature is better than outside. I guess I can already answer many qutious question about 2021 bein a good year.: fuckin no it will be just as bad as 2020.

"TIFU by giving out to an autistic child at work 
Happened a number of years back at a music shop where I worked.

Was behind the counter and a 13/14 year old and his grandmother came up to the counter. I was in my early 20s and had no knowledge of autism or how it impacts peoples behaviour 

He asked something like

'Do you have Fallout 3' in a very aggressive manner 

I replied with
'On which console?'

He fires back with even more anger
'DO YOU HAVE FALLOUT 3?'

I was a  bit annoyed now and asked again
'On which console?'

He comes back again and goes
'DO YOU HAVE FALLOUT 3!?'

I was pissed now and go
'Please don't talk to me like that, it's very rude. If you can be more polite, I'll be happy to help'

The boy doesn't take any notice of what I say but the granny interjects now and goes
'How dare you speak to him like that, he has autism' and they storm off.

I caught eye contact with another customer and they gave me a half sympathy/half you  fucking donkey kind of look.

I still randomly think about it at 3am and it makes me  cringe a lot

"I love celeb face close ups When in a movie or in real life they get an extreme close up and you can see their pores, their freckles and wrinkles. I find them oddly satisfing.

"TIFU by drinking my sister’s coffee 

Obligatory didn’t happen today. 

A couple months ago, I was on a roadie with my sisters and 2 year old nephew. It was mid winter in the Midwest and they were naturally snotting up a storm (Important later). When we stopped to get gas, I went in first, then came back to the car to sit with my nephew while they did their business.

Well, I was thirsty, and the two cups of coffee from this morning were still in the cup holder upfront. Not afraid of some lukewarm coffee, I reached forward and took what felt like a 1/4 full cup of coffee.

I drained that bitch, noticing it had sort of a weird texture?? Like??? A little chunky, but assumed it was just sugar clumped up or something.

My sisters came back to the car, saw me with the empty cup, and subsequently died of laughter.

While I’d been in the gas station my sisters- yes, both- had spit lugies into it. 

So yep, that’s how I fucked up drinking coffee

"My crush didn’t send me any texts from the day I stopped talking with her. I cut of communication with my crush for my own good. I had removed all my social medias as well. Only recently it has come to my attention that she never sent me a text since I stopped initiating the conversations. I was talking so much with her and thought we might have atleast become good friends but I guess it was all in my head. Making peace with your reality is tough and heartbreaking.

Edit: 
I had told her my true feelings before I stopped talking to her. I understand that she did not want a relationship and not everyone can be good friends that’s fine. I’m sad cause it hurts to see that it was all in my mind and I was making things out to be better than they actually were. 

Not asking anyone to hate her. It’s just that I never realized the pain will last this long and change my life weirdly.

"TIFU by changing my New Year tradition This happened a week ago, but it's taken me until now to post.

So, it's nearly midnight on New Year's Eve. Normally, I'm in bed and fast asleep by the time the clock strikes twelve (I know, how boring) but this year I was both awake and in the mood for some amazing sex. Great way to see the New Year in, right? 

Everything was going great - that is, until I experience an agonising pain in my hip accompanied by a cracking sound. Sex most definitely at the very back of my mind at that point, I tried convincing myself and my partner that everything was fine and I did not need to go to hospital. Neither of us convinced by my feeble attempts to pretend I was OK, a scramble to get dressed (while I could barely move) so I could go and get it checked out.

"TIFU by giving someone a Totoro plushie for Christmas So we had a secret santa at work. Conveniently, just the week before, I had had a conversation with my ss target about stuff we liked. Anime, specifically Studio Ghibli were among favorites. She mentioned liking the cat, Jiji from Kiki's Delivery Service. 

Well we were only given about a week to get a gift. I couldn't order something Online. I wasn't trying to go to the mall because of covid. We work in a healthcare setting. I happen to have around the house, a Totoro plushie. It still even had the tag on it. I, being Frugal person that I am, decided this would be perfect. It's like new. I was trying to sell it on eBay anyway. I made sure to deodorize it, make sure there was nothing on it, no dust, I even Sanitized it. Cute bag. Nice paper. Remained anonymous. Very glad I did.

Today, I asked her, without telling her it was me, what her ss gave her. She was. Pissed. She answered shortly, with attitude. ""A cat."" 

I acted surprised. ""A cat?""

""A stuffed cat. Not a real one. A hate cats. I'm allergic to cats.""

I ended the awkward convo, as did she. The only things I can think of are that somehow, my cats gave her an allergic reaction.. Even though I thoroughly checked it and they've never had contact with it.. Or that she couldn't recognize that it was Totoro? But who hasn't seen Totoro when you mention Miyazaki films and talk about Kiki's Delivery Service? I don't even necessarily mean who hasn't seen the movie. I haven't even seen it. But who at least doesn't recognize it?

I am very glad I remain anonymous and pray my department coworkers don't tell her it was me. I made the personal decision to never speak to her again out of shame.

"My brother has come out as trans and I don't believe any of it... Before you get upset, understand that I accept everyone. I have gay and trans friends and have even roomed with some before. I understand what trans and gay individuals go through and have gone though... that being said, I believe this situation is a little different. 

Growing up, I knew my brother better than anyone else in my family. We shared a room together. That being said, my brother has never expressed any displeasure with who he is. He's always being comfortable with being a guy and has never told me, or anyone else otherwise. It wasn't until he got out of jail, for a crime he didn't commit, did that change. 

My brother was taken advantage of while he was in there and when he came out he began explaining to everyone that he thinks he's a female. He went through a lot of trauma as a child, he also has aspergers and I believe this is his way of coping. 

I'm struggling with calling him any female identifiers, even the new name he picked out (he's even dropping his surname). I'm very confident that this is the byproduct of his experience in jail and it pisses me off to no end that he went through the trama he did while he was in there. I want to kill the individual responsible, and I don't want to harm anyone, but this person is certainly the exception. 

Who knows, maybe he has always felt uncomfortable being a male, and maybe this has nothing to do with what happened. At the end of the day though, I'll end up calling him what he wants to be called, but right now, I just have an over abundance of annoyance toward the situation.",0,"['my', 'brother', 'has', 'come',

"I'm (23M) so scared and anxious about relationship because I fear the day I'll be cheated on or my GF ask for open relationship I don't get in any relationship with women because i'm so scared of the outcome of it. I fear the day she'll lose interest in me and seek for other relationships. I keep reading on non-monogamy relationship and this idea doesn't really get into my head. I read studies that women doesn't want long term relationship or they want casual sex/openness after couple of months/years. Studies shows more people want ""polyamourous"", especially girls. 

I think it scares the s*** out of me because I know deep down it is true. The way I see love might no longer exist. 

It gives me true anxiety, like past 2 days I kept reading about this again and again and I feel anxious. There's a women i'm interested in but I feel like it's not worth it, I'll suffer eventually.

"I want the Snake Man (NSFW) I've always suffered from hyperfixations, my whole life. Up until now, they've been relatively harmless.

Recently, I stumbled across this semi-well known YouTube guy who makes videos about reptiles. And I fell into the rabbit hole. Three days later and I realize, as I obsessively view his thousands of videos;

Fuck. I want to fuck the snake man. Bad.

He's literally twice my age, with a wife. A middle aged dude with a ponytail and a paunch. Not even my type. But something about the enthusiasm and the passion that he exudes has my legs shaking. The pure, genuine enthusiasm in his face as he dangles alligators makes me shake. I find myself watching his fingers as he wrestles anacondas, the way he licks his lips before he starts a sentence. He's literally talking about ball python eggs and I'm clenching my thighs and biting my lip  And I'm just like, damn. Damn damn damn. He's so fucking hot. 

I want him to fuck me in the python enclosure. I want him to whisper filthy things in my ear.  I want to be choked by those strong hands. I want him to hold me down.

"TIFU by standing on my end table to close my window. This happened Christmas night. I had just a few local friends come over for the holiday since we all couldn't travel - we drank, ordered in, watched a movie, and caught up. After a couple people left, the only people still here was myself, my roommate, and one of our best guy friends. I had been bothering him for a while to show him something nerdy on my computer and finally convinced him to stick around for a bit more. He took a moment to go to the bathroom, my roommate went to her room to start getting ready for bed, and I went to my room to turn on my computer. It was a really windy night, so before he came back, I went to step on my end table to close the upper part of my window - a move that I have done at least a dozen times before and knew one day it would be my literal downfall. This was that day. 

I stepped too close to the edge and fell really hard to the floor. I was shocked mostly and started to scramble to try to get up. My roommate ran into my room screaming ""OMG what happened"", and I was like ""yeah, no, nothing, all is fine, just fell"". I got to my knees and elbows finally, looked at her, then looked down to the floor to see all of my sex toys, handcuffs, and condoms spread everywhere. I surprise Pikachu faced and then scurried to push everything under my bed screaming ""\[FRIEND\] CAN'T SEE THIS, THIS IS WEIRD"". Just after cleaning up the water that spilled from my end table humidifier as well, friend came into the door and I went to the computer to continue showing him nerd things. Five minutes later, he looks over to the end table and asks ""what happened here?"". I say ""oh nothing, don't worry about it"" and then look over and see that right where the front of my first drawer should be is one single condom precariously placed at the edge staring out at us. I brushed it off and he eventually left. 

The next morning I woke up with bruises all down the right side of my body. I'm not a stranger at all to sex talk and jokes, but was not prepared for this kind of drunk and impromptu ""show and tell"" alone with this friend. He's also an avid Reddit user, so friend - if you see this - shoot me a text and laugh at me.

"TIFU by offering to play music at a church gathering This happened about 12-15 years ago. I was at a youth group (church kids group) event, and we were waiting for the last few kids to show up in a group of ~20, waiting in the lobby area of the church. I had recently gotten a PlayStation Portable, and loved every second I got to play it. I was making good progress on Daxter, and thought this would be a good time to keep that progress going. 

My youth group leader was cool, but always wanted everyone to be engaged and interactive, so when he saw me playing on my fancy technology by myself, he immediately said some snarky line about “you can only play with that if everyone can play at the same time.” 

Now, when someone gets snarky with me, I look for any opportunity to prove them wrong. In this case, I thought I’d showcase just how versatile this new tech was by showing off how it has a ton of music on it too. The future is now, old man! I said some line that I thought was witty at the time, then strolled over and plugged the church speakers right on into my PSP headphone jack so I could make my point. 

At this point, I should mention that at this age, I was becoming aware of pornography, beginning with a girls gone wild video of a girl licking another girls tit and spiraling downward from there. My shiny new PSP offered a perfect access portal to all this new content through its web browser, and I took every opportunity to explore it. One of those opportunities was the morning before I went to that youth group meeting. I’m guessing you see where this is going. 

Jump back to me plugging my PSP into the church speakers. I’m a little hazy as to whether I pressed play, or if it auto played from the source that played most recently, but either way, me and all the rest of the god-fearing congregation were very disappointed to hear moans, “oh yeah”s, and a series of squelches come out of the loudspeakers before I managed to switch over to an actual song. That was actually part of the FU is that I thought I’d be able to play it off better if I didn’t just yank out the cord. 

I said something about those noises being part of some song, then slowly walked away with a beet red face and “American Idiot” playing in the background. I received several pointed sermons in the following weeks and could never look the adults from the congregation in the eye ever again. My family ended up switching to a different church because of all of the stern talks they were getting about how to raise their kid properly. 

Tl;dr: tried to play music over the church speakers, porn audio played instead, and my whole family had to start going to a new church.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'offering', 'to', 'play', 'music', 'at',

"I'm a transgender man, but no one knows I have no one to talk to about this, so I'll just have to get all this out here. I've known that I am transgender since the tenth grade (I am 21 now) and first heard what being trans means from a former friend. I've always desired to be male. I dream about it and think about it everyday. I hate these desires. They are driving me to insanity. 

I went to a ""therapeutic boarding school"" for high school, since my self hatred and disgust at myself and my body had led me to cutting and burning myself, as well as turning to anorexia to reduce my feminine features (which later turned into binging and purging bc why not). I attempted to socially transition while I was there, but was met with disgust and isolation from my peers and the staff would day in and day out tell me I was obviously crazy and these feelings would go away. I believed them.

But the feelings haven't gone away. No, my desires for being a part of manhood have only grown, as well as my crippling dysphoria. I hate my body. I hate my voice. I hate how people see me. I hate that I feel this way. I want to be normal. I truly do. There is nothing 'fun' nor 'special' about my experience. I cant return feelings to men or women because the person they are looking at is not me. I don't form close friendships, I am distant from my family, and I have anxiety every time I step outside. No one knows me, and I don't want them to. I'm a fake. No one needs to know I am a freak. That I am a sick individual with sick desires beyond my reach. I just want to be normal. I don't think I'd be able to find love if I transition. I know I would be happier, but alone. 

I've debated taking my own life. I have this fantasy that I'll be a great man in my next life. That I'll be strong and tall and be able to protect those around me. I want these dreams to be a reality, so suicide has been looking more and more inviting. I don't think these desires will go away. No, I know they wont go away. I've been suffering for years. I feel like I am crazy. I don't even find much comfort within the trans community because I feel like I'll never have the guts those people have. Not to mention the nastier side of me hates half of the FTM community because I feel like more than a handful are just jumping onto a trend. Dysphoria isn't fun. It isn't something to glorify. My dysphoria will kill me. And a part of me is willing to let it. 

I know I should man up and let one of my few friends that I haven't cut out of my life know what's up. But I feel like a freak. This is abnormal. I feel deformed. Not to mention I could never tell my conservative, Christian family. I'm already the fuck up. I've turned to drugs and alcohol to drown out these feelings. I dropped out of college because I had to do a self portrait for my figure drawing class, but I just couldn't. Who I see in the mirror isn't me. So my dumbass dropped out of college because I couldn't look myself in the eye. I didn't leave my apartment for a year besides for work because I didn't want anyone to see me. All I did was drugs in hopes I would have some revelation that would turn me normal. But I've sobered up to just weed on the weekends and my dysphoria is worse than ever. I fucked up and am still at square one. I have no idea how to move forward in life. 

For now I'm going to try to be strong. I have little siblings that would be traumatized if I killed myself. I got a cat to look after so I have something to tether me to this earth. But I have no idea if I can put up with this much longer. Either I decide to be a man about my situation and transition, or, more likely, I'll meet an early grave. Thanks for listening to my secret. It's kinda nice getting this out.",0,"[""i'm"", 'transgender', 'man', 'but', 'no', 'one', 'knows', 'have', 'no', 'one', 'to', 'talk', 'to', 'about', 'this', 'so', ""i'll"", 'just', 'have', 'to',

"TIFU by sending fake homework to school for 2 months So two months ago I had a problem. I wasn't doing any homework and I didn't really care that much until the day our teachers mentioned that our grades would be based on homework since they couldn't do exams(they didn't trust online exams and we couldn't go to school because of lockdown). So I was panicking thinking I was gonna get a very low score on all of my classes since I did at best 10 of the hundreds of homework's given this year. So I decided that I should just submit fake homework. Basically I made a program that would find blank spaces in the page and fill them with premade images of calculations and such. then I would just submit those. And it worked for like a couple months

&amp;#x200B;

But Today my teacher found something wrong with my uploads and decided to take a look he found out that none of the calculations I had on the math paper made any sense. Then he took a look at the other stuff I sent and found out that I'd been submitting fake homework for the past 2 months. Needless to say he told the other teachers about it and now I have to do 2 months of homework in the span of 3 days or I'm gonna be getting a 0 on my homework points

"TIFU by accidentally deleting months of work. I decided to try my hand at writing a young adult novel.  I also have a full time job, so opportunities to write are few and far between.  Now, this is a very very rough draft, but still, I have put in a few months of work.

I have all of my writing saved on my Chromebook.  The laptop died recently, so I connected the charger and powered it up.  It asked for my password, which I had changed recently, since some of my  accounts got hacked.  Unfortunately, with it being late at night, I couldn't remember my password.  Chromebooks security feature kicked in and asked if I wanted to de-crypt my account with an old password.  Not sure what this meant, I entered one of my old passwords.  Chromebook then deleted my drive, all of my files not backed up onto the cloud were wiped, with no chance of recovery.

"TIFU by accidentally hitting on a customer Not a long story but as a new years resolution I told myself I would make an effort to compliment people because it always makes me feel good when I receive one.
So this woman comes in and she's really nice and friendly and as I'm making her coffee we are having a chat and she has this huge belt that is absolutely covered in those sparkly jewel thingies. So I say. ""I really like your belt it's really shiny"" she smiles and says ""thanks"" so I go. ""I wish I could pull it off"" not thinking that it could mean something else other than I wish it looked good on me. she blushes and looks down and when I finish her coffee she looks at me and smiles and says ""thanks"" so my assistant manager comes over and she's like ""did you just tell her you wanted to take her belt off?"" My face goes red as I realise what I said. I explained it to my assistant manager who just laughed and told me to think about what i say before I say it 

Tl;dr complimented a customer on her belt and told her I wish I could pull it off.

"TIFU buying wine for a new roommate This was a few years ago, but remember it like yesterday.

While on internship in Brazil I got a new roommate. She was due to arrive the evening of this day. We'd had some contact beforehand through mail and she was up for a party planned for that day. Double reason for a good bottle of wine (which is quite expensive in Brazil). 

For those who haven't been to a Brazilian supermarket, they use VERY thin plastic bags and pack everything without you even having a chance of using your own bags. When I was almost back home, the bag with the wine decided to break. I was a bit sad, but accidents happen. I put the groceries inside, but on my way outside to clean up the glass I saw a trail of bloody footprints. Apparently the bottle fell onto my sandaled foot. When the guard came to check on me he panicked and called an ambulance, so here I was, in a foreign country with a tiny cut in a tiny toe, loaded into an ambulance (in the end a good call, because the tendon was ruptured).

When the poor roommate arrived there was no me, no party, no wine and only a dark house with a trail of bloody footprints.

TL:DR dropped the wine for my new roommate on a toe, cutting a tendon and leaving her to come home to a dark and bloody appartement instead of a party",1,"['tifu', 'buying', 'wine', 'for', 'new',

"TIFU by accidentally committing myself to a crisis unit This happened a couple weeks ago, and maybe it isn’t a total fuck up, but at the time it felt like one!

So I got involved in a bad situation, for me and my kids. I kept asking for help because things were getting.... crazy for lack of a better word. Long story short, cops got involved and my ex stole my car and I couldn’t do anything cause I was high on cocaine. 

So I go to moms, clear my head, and start making changes, which included talking about rehab. My genius mom decided I needed help ASAP so she devised a really good plan to get me a 72 hour hold mental lock up so I can get in to see a psychiatrist faster. 

Cue fuck up. I went all in. Yes, there were symptoms; suicidal idealization, drug use, days of foggy insanity (apparently mania), and I let them know about it all. Which leads me to a crisis unit almost 2 hours away from home, that strongly resembled a Wentworth (check it out on Netflix) style prison, but without bars. 

Guys. If I wasn’t suicidal before, this place was awful. But I digress. Turns out I’m actually bipolar, and now I’m on meds and getting better. 

But here is the true fuck up. Not only did I get court ordered to stay an entire week (on top of the two days I spent in the hospital), CPS was called. 

Guess who is ordered to live with their parents to be supervised with their children?

So I had to leave my apartment and job (no way to transfer or commute) and I have to LIVE with my parents for 60 days - 6 months if I behave and follow the rules.

"TIFU by yelling at my girlfriend about my problems and making her cry. This happened several weeks ago and even though my girlfriend K (15F) has forgiven me for it i (16F) still can't forgive myself for this.

I've been at K's home with her parents since this pandemic has started and im still here today but that's not important. What's really important is that i yelled at the one person that i love most And i can't believe i would say all this shit to her. 

I come from a terrible home life which i won't get into but it's caused my self esteem and self worth to plummet as well as my anger issues getting worse and worse my self esteem is getting better but i still have outbursts this is important for later. 

So i had a fight with my friend R (16M) who is also K's best friend they've been through everything together and have rarely fought with eachother which i envy alot.

Me and K don't really fight but sometimes when we do it gets BAD. I mean it goes off to one time K going on a walk to cool off in the rain. 

K was talking to me about my anger and my ego (i tend to be prideful alot when i fight with someone which is my worst trait.) and was telling me ""OP your anger is frightening me. I feel like it's getting worse and worse with every argument you can't let your ego get in your way""

I was still pissed and told her ""why the hell does this have to do with my ego? Im glad of what type of person i am I don't wanna change anything."" 

K told me ""but your anger is causing issues which i could see bringing a bunch of future problems down the road do you wanna try and see if my mom can set you up with a therapist?"" 

I have a bad history with therapists as they never really helped me out that much or at all so i got furious at that point and told her ""i don't need a damn therapist im fine! You shouldn't try to force me to change if i don't wanna god damn do it! The K i know would support me and be happy with who i am right? Well it's clear your not being the K i love."" 

She nodded at me and the moment i realize how badly i snapped at her i looked at her face and saw her with tears in her eyes. She got up and left before i could say anything she closed the door. 

I get a text from her dad (him and K's mom were working that night) saying ""listen i know you don't have a good home life but that was really uncalled for with what you said you better hope she forgives you because i sure as hell won't until you make it up to my daughter."" 

I got texts from pretty much all my friends saying what a dickhead and inconsiderate asshole i am etc. I got hate for days and honestly i deserved it. 

After K got home from M's place (M is 17 and across the street) i gave her a big hug apologizing profusely crying on her shoulder etc. 

It was that time of month for her so i set her a warm bath and made cookies and watched her favorite anime with her she seemed to be happy with the day and I've also been seeing a nice therapist too because i felt guilty and wanted to give it a shot. 

Her parents have forgiven me thankfully and we've been doing well except I've been given the nickname hotheaded time bomb by her parents but i just live with it lol.

Thank you all for whoever read this all the way through stay safe out there and have a nice day.

"TIFU by hitting a toddler in the head with a swing, TWICE For some background: In Autumn, the have this farm kinda thing that opens up. They have the typical kind of things, like pumpkin patches, corn mazes, kettle corn, that kind of stuff. At this farm, they have a swing at a top of a hill. The swing connects to a tree branch, and leads to the ground by the hill. Also by the hill is a small stream (you would have had to have been there to really get it).

The Cast: Me, my friend D, and a random lady, who I will call RL.

This takes place about 5 years ago, I was probably about 10. Me and D really wanted to go on the swing, so we got in line. I go on once, and I love it. So I get back in line to try it again. But as I get to the front of the line, there is a lady getting some kids out of the way of the stream (I'm pretty sure the kids were triplets, probably toddlers). 

At this point, it's my turn to get on the swing, so I hop on and push of the hill. But as I'm heading down on the swing, on of the triplets runs back to the stream. I try to stop or swerve around the kid, but I am too late. The swing smacked the kid right in the head, causing him to fall into the stream. As the swing starts to swing back, however, the kid gets back up. The swing then hits the kid in the back of the head, knocking him over again. 

At this point, the lady runs over, and takes the kid away, while the kid is screaming bloody murder. Some other lady runs over, and we have this conversation:

RL: ""Why did you do that!?""

Me: ""I don't know! I tried to stop!""

RL: ""Yeah, sure.""

Me and D walk away, talking about what happened. I look over and see the kid with his family, getting patched up. 

I feel terrible about what happened. I could've caused that kid seriously bad, permanent, head problems. I probably also killed any love for swings he had.

TL;DR I smashed a kid in the head with a swing, TWICE, probably causing serious head problems.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'hitting', 'toddler', 'in', 'the', 'head', 'with', 'swing', 'twice', 'for', 'some',

"TIFU by completely flipping my lid, breaking a stick, and berating my own mother for the way she's been treating her new dog. So, to start off, I'm a fairly quiet person; I keep to myself, I (unhealthily) bottle up a lot of those nasty feelings, and I usually just try my best to stay out of things, but that usually just ends up in me losing my patience and then blowing up, especially when it comes to my family. My family is dysfunctional, stubborn, and (not to be sexist, I promise) the women will ***ALWAYS*** gang up against whatever unfortunate soul decides to breathe wrong in their presence.  


So, on to where I fucked up... Well, my mother has the patience of a spoiled toddler, and will snap and get mad at just about anything that is a mild inconvenience to her sedentary and self-indulging lifestyle. Makes me wonder sometimes why she even bothered to have/keep me, and why she bothers to get animals that need to be trained so they know commands and/or what not to do. So, she recently got a puppy not even a month after our previous girl passed, and I wasn't too happy about it, but I wasn't about to stop her. This puppy is very spoiled, has little to no training, and has enough energy to act as a generator for my neighborhood. She's been an inside dog for a good bit now, and occasionally has an accident or two in the house, I mean... It's understandable. She's just a pup, and she still needs to learn, but my mother is just like ""OH MY GOD! FUCKING DOG! NO! OUTSIDE!"" pretty much dragging to poor girl out by the collar, stomping her way over to the little puddle, cleaning it up, and then yelling at the pup to go to bathroom outside, but she won't because all of it was on the very-easy-to-clean tile-floor.  


The pup tends to get into quite a bit of trouble when left unsupervised. Let's say we leave her outside for a little bit to go to the bathroom or something, yeah? Well, she'll start digging in the garden, getting under rabbit hutches, chewing up dead leaves and tree bark, and eating things she probably shouldn't. Rather than taking the time to teach the dog, my mother will chase her. Pup doesn't know any better, thinks she's playing, and will run away with whatever new toy or snack she managed to pick up. So, what really got my blood boiling is when I saw my mother chasing the poor dog with a stick, swinging it at her, yelling at her, being an all-around bitch with anger-management issues, and I was having none of it anymore. I went down there, took the stick, broke it into little pieces, and threw it right over the fence. Yeah, she didn't like that. She started yelling at me, asking why I did that, raising her tone as if I had just done the worst thing she could possibly imagine, and, when it comes to my family, thanks to the years and years of abuse I've had to endure, the limit to the shit I can put up with is riiiiiiight above 0. Maybe 0.02. The more she yelled, the more I found myself yelling. The more she talked over me, the more I found myself telling her to ""shut up and listen."" I made a mistake, I didn't stay calm, I let her push me over the edge, and she ran with it, trying to pull the ""parent card"". I yelled, and yelled, and yelled, berating her for not actually training the dog to do anything, but instead teaching her to be afraid, abusing her into obedience. It didn't feel good, but I couldn't stop. Every word I said just pulled more out with it. I even said ""listen, princess, nobody is going to cater to your every need and make sure you don't get hurt."" ... It's not like I've never fought with her, but I've never gone this far. I've never had a reason to tell her that she doesn't just refuse criticism, but she takes it as a full-on attack. She pretends like everyone is out to get her, like everyone wants to blame her for something, and it's fucking annoying. I told her it was annoying... I told her that ***she*** was annoying... I said way too much, and now she's doing the usual silent-treatment, actively avoiding me, not even bothering to look my way. Feels like she doesn't want me to exist, and sometimes I wish I didn't either, but tough shit. She never wants to admit she's wrong, so when she's told that she is, she doubles down, refuses to admit fault, and then pouts because ""*ThEy WeRe MeAn To Me*!""  


I'm 24, jobless, friendless, a failure, and I have no right doing this shit when I am basically an overgrown dependent. I could get kicked onto the street at a moment's notice, and so I've been treading lightly, but this was the final fucking straw, man... I'm scared that I may not have a home if I cross another line like that, but I couldn't just say nothing. I'd be enabling her to keep doing the same shit, and I didn't want to be responsible for that. Funny enough, she's been treating the dog better now, but I shouldn't have had to risk everything just to change that.  


  
tl;dr I fucked up by breaking the stick my mother used to try and punish her puppy, and ended up letting 24 years of pent up frustration flow out of my mouth, potentially putting my living situation at risk.

little puddle cleaning it up and then yelling at the pup to go to bathroom outside but she won't because all of it was on the very easy to clean tile floor the pup tends to get into quite bit of trouble when left unsupervised let's say we leave her outside for little bit to go to the bathroom or something yeah well she'll start digging in the garden getting under rabbit hutches chewing up dead leaves and tree bark and eating things she probably shouldn't rather than taking the time to teach the dog my mother will chase her pup doesn't know any better thinks she's playing and will run away with whatever new toy or snack she managed to pick up so what really got my blood boiling is when saw my mother chasing the poor dog with stick swinging it at her yelling at her being an all around bitch with anger management issues and was having none of it anymore went down there took the stick broke it into little pieces and threw it right over the fence yeah she didn't like that she started yelling at me asking why did that raising her tone as if had just done the worst thing she could possibly imagine and when it comes to my family thanks to the years and years of abuse i've had to endure the limit to the shit can put up with is riiiiiiight above maybe 02 the more she yelled the more found myself yelling the more she talked over me the more found myself telling her to shut up and listen made mistake didn't stay calm let her push me over the edge and she ran with it trying to pull the parent card yelled and yelled and yelled berating her for not actually training the dog to do anything but instead teaching her to be afraid abusing her into obedience it didn't feel good but couldn't stop every word said just pulled more out with it even said listen princess nobody is going to cater to your every need and make sure you don't get hurt it's not like i've never fought with her but i've never gone this far i've never had reason to tell her that she doesn't just refuse criticism but she takes it as full on attack she pretends like everyone is out to get her like everyone wants to blame her for something and it's fucking annoying told her it was annoying told her that she was annoying said way too much and now she's doing the usual silent treatment actively avoiding me not even bothering to look my way feels like she doesn't want me to exist and sometimes wish didn't either but tough shit she never wants to admit she's wrong so when she's told that she is she doubles down refuses to admit fault and then pouts because they were mean to me i'm 24 jobless friendless failure and have no right doing this shit when am basically an overgrown dependent could get kicked onto the street at moment's notice and so i've been treading lightly but this was the final fucking straw man i'm scared that may not have home if cross another line like that but couldn't just say nothing i'd be enabling her to keep doing the same shit and didn't want to be responsible for that funny enough she's been treating the dog better now but shouldn't have had to risk everything just to change that tl dr fucked up by breaking the stick my mother used to try and

"TIFU by purchasing Persona Endless Night Collection (Apologies for bad mobile formatting.)
*Also, obligatory “this was not today.”*
Soooo, allow me to give a bit of context. 
Persona Dancing: Endless Night Collection is a bundle of three Persona Dancing games: 3, 4, and 5. 4 being the most interesting, with a story mode and best OST in my opinion, while the other two being basic rehashes of this game with different OSTs, dances and models without any real story mode. 
As part of the bundle, Persona 4 Dancing is a digital download as opposed to the other two being physical discs. 
Cut to receiving this bundle on Christmas, and to my surprise; *The digital download code had expired 20 days earlier.* It was never specified before purchasing that this was an issue, and nothing much has come out of customer service. 
All I could find was other people with the same issue warning people *not* to buy the bundle. P3D and P5D are... mediocre, but it’s also bad on my part for not looking into things before walking into disappointment.

"TIFU by not knowing the difference between booty call and butt dial. Obligatory this didn’t happen today, but this fuckup was recent. 

For my entire life, I thought that booty call meant the same thing as butt dial. I have told a large amount of people, including relatives, that I booty called them. I have gotten many strange and disturbed looks after saying this, but for some reason nobody ever corrected me. 

I wish they had, because a little while back, I accidentally called my mom. When she answered the call I apologized and told her that it was a booty call. She was weirded out, which confused me, and my misunderstanding resulted in her spending a good five minutes awkwardly explaining that apparently booty call has a different meaning than butt dial.

"TIFU by using an airplane bathroom Obligatory this happened about 4 years ago, but I figured it belonged here.

So as a child (up until the age of about 6) my parents would take us from the cold northeast to Florida for a mini vacation every year, but that was the only time I had been on a plane before I was 15. I don't even remember those plane rides. So, I'm 15, starting to look into colleges, and my dad decides we should fly to some schools to go see the campuses. I said cool! Let's go! So, we're on this plane, about 2 hours into a 4.5 hour flight, and I have to pee. Okay, that's fine, bathroom is only a few rows up. I get up, make my way to the vacant bathroom, open the door. I go in, shut and lock the door behind me, and sit down to pee. At least I thought I locked the door. I'm mid pee, when the door swings open (on its own free will), and I'm suddenly staring into the eyes of a 30-something year old man WHILE peeing. He says nothing. I say nothing. Luckily the plane bathrooms are small enough I can just reach out and pull the door closed and ACTUALLY lock it. Finish up, get out of there as swiftly as possible, didn't even tell my dad what had happened. Traumatized.

&amp;#x200B;

Since that day, I have never used an airplane bathroom, and the funny thing is, I now attend one of those colleges that a 4.5 hour flight away, so I fly quite a bit.

"TIFU by talking to a married man As with most people, I also turned online to connect with others (aside from my family and friends) on the wake of lockdowns.

Back in July or August, I decided to try this infamous website that allows you to talk to strangers. Lo and behold, I was matched with this interesting guy. We talked for about an hour and decided we'll continue talking on a different platform. It was going great except that we're in different countries and we can't meet personally - which eventually turned out to be a good thing now.

Our entire interaction is obviously online. At the start, we used to talk every single day and as you might have already expected, after some time, we started fooling around. However, at some point our messages became sporadic. There were times that we wouldn’t speak for a week, or even for a month. I’m cool and didn’t think too much of it. In my head, we’re adults and there are adult things that we need to do.

Then last night just before I went to bed, I received a message from him. I decided to sleep and to open it the next day. When I finally opened his message, it was a photo of his wife and then a video of him taken by his wife. He really looked so fucked up on the video, I must say. Now I’ve been called a home wrecking whore even if I didn’t have a single idea that he was married. I thought of a lengthy reply defending myself, but ended up apologizing and saying that I wasn’t aware of the whole situation.

I feel so guilty that I am a part of this mess and that I ruined a marriage.

TLDR: Been talking to a man and today I received a message and found out he’s married.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'talking', 'to', 'married', 'man', 'as', 'with', 'most', 'people', 'also', 'turned', 'online',

"TIFU by telling my crush that I liked her This was about 10 years ago but I still remember this like it was yesterday, so I was in 9th grade, horny as hell and shit like that. I really wanted a girlfriend, all my friends had one and I felt lonely. It was the day before Valentine’s Day and all my friends were doing like double dates and shits, of course I wasn’t invited because I was a loner. so I kind of liked this girl that we will call Ashley for the sake of the story. So I get ready to ask her, I had a single red rose, was wearing my older brothers cologne and wore a semi fancy shirt. I walk down the hall to her locker where she was standing and I was feeling like a hot shot. I tap her on her left shoulder and say,”will you be my valentine?”. I shit you not, she stood there and just stared at me, and after what felt like a lifetime, she said she is not into guys. FUCK.

"TIFU by going on a run. Some backstory: This December (31st for me), my family and I were exposed to covid by a relative early this month, and none of us have gone out. I felt sick relatively late but it is well past the ten day mark since my first symptom and I've felt fine for 3-4 days. 

Onto the fuck up. I'm a teen (and a dumb one at that) who, today, lost one of my closest friends. In need of a pick up I thought I'd go for a run, as that was one of my passtimes I gave up since covid started. It is under freezing temperatures where I am and hyping myself up and sticking a hand outside, I figured I'd be fine with a light hoodie and sweatpants. 

After not even a minute of running, I felt like my throat was closing up, freezing, and my chest felt cold to the core, though my skin was warm. I figured I'd be fine and keep going for another minute until I felt dizzy and (still running, thinking I'm fine and wanting to push my body) run home for the next minute or so. 

I get home, take my hoodie off and lie down in my bed. I then get nauseous and go to the nearest bathroom because I feel like I'm gonna throw up. My freezing chest and dizziness was still very much going on and now I'm out of breath. After 5 minutes or so, I call my parents, thinking Im gonna pass out. They tell me it was stupid to go on a run after being sick and stuck inside for weeks (which I agree with) and to take a hot shower. 

I'm now sitting down in the bathroom after a shower, too out of breath to leave, telling you all my fuck-up. My chest is still cold and deep breaths are impossible without coughing. Tomorrow I'm gonna go on a VERY slow walk.

Tl;Dr: Went on a run in below freezing temperatures after being sick with covid. Chest cold. Can't breath.

"TIFU by saying ""hey look it's your boyfriend!"" This happened today and I'm now facepalming at the comment i made about my friend. 

Little bit of context: im living with my girlfriend's parent's and have been since everything started with the world circumstances and a different topic not for this sub. 

So my best friend let's call him R (16M) came out to me as bi romantic (for those of you who don't know it's romantic attraction to both genders) and im proud of him for coming out to me and my girlfriend K! (15F) Of course we supported him 


While we were supporting him and he and i (16F) were having a conversation with his girlfriend M (17F) and he seemed to calm down a bit until the dumbass inside of me decided to pull his strings a bit here comes the FU. 

So the 4 of us were having a conversation which eventually lead to video call (something we do fairly often and we love it) 

K was watching dragon ball super which was an interest both of them shared and a scene came up where Android 17 came up (his favorite character) and i proudly yelled ""hey R look it's your boyfriend!"" while pointing the camera at the TV while laughing my ass off after.

R quickly excused himself and turned off his camera and i later found out that his notifications were probably turned off considering he wasn't texting K and hasn't spoken since. 

M and K told me that my joke really wasn't funny and ""he's still very embarrassed you should be more considerate"" and proceeded with about a 20 minute lecture but K wasn't mad M however...Just a little bit

"TIFU by cleaning my mask with all-purpose cleaner I had been tested positive for COVID and had to self-quarantine in my house. This meant wearing a mask whenever I went into the kitchen because I live with my family. I have a fabric, reusable mask that I thought would be easy to clean with all-purpose cleaner and hot water, then I'd leave it on the fan to dry. I did clean my mask this way for a couple days and I got really sick during that time - I'm talking about vomiting and diarrhea. I thought it was because of COVID but I was really nearing the end of my two weeks so it shouldn't have been this bad. I didn't realize it was my stupid way of cleaning my mask that was making me feel sick until I wore my other fabric mask and didn't feel nauseous for once. I took a whiff at my cleaner mask and came to the conclusion that I was inhaling bleach or whatever chemicals they put in it every time I wore that mask. In hindsight, it was really fucking dumb of me to clean it with all-purpose cleaner instead of rotating between my three fabric masks and doing laundry.

"TIFU by leaving a real Christmas tree in my apartment until May. I actually fucked up 8 years ago, but time has worn down my pride enough that I'm willing to finally share this story with the world. 

It was recently suggested to me that I leave my Christmas tree up a little longer in order to further enjoy the cheeriness it brings to the living room. This is an easy thing to suggest when you haven't seen the things I've seen. When you haven't done the things that my boyfriend and I have done. You see, when you have one year when you leave your tree up until May, that experience changes you. It changes Christmas forever.

We have always used real trees as opposed to artificial ones, which means they need to be disposed of after the holidays. Back when we lived in an apartment they had a small window of time when you could leave the tree by the curb and they would haul it away for you. Unfortunately we missed that window, which turned into weeks and weeks of pretending the tree just... didn't exist. Sure the ornaments came down, but the skeletal remains of Christmas stood in our living room as a monument to our evasion of basic responsibilities. 

One day, in late February or so, we realized we could be having friends over for dinner. We thought, ""Oh my god. We can't let people know we still have this tree!"" So we did what any logical couple would do and we hid it in the closet with a white blanket over it. You can imagine how terrifying it was in the beginning when you would get up to use the restroom in the middle of the night and see an 8 foot tall Christmas tree ghost looming in the doorway.

I don't know what the final straw was. Maybe it was the storage space we were losing by having a massive cloaked Douglas fir in our closet. Maybe it was that we missed using the blanket that had taken on a new purpose in life. Whatever it was, we knew we couldn't avoid this issue any longer. The problem of how to dispose of the tree still existed. We couldn't leave it at the curb, and we knew wherever we took it, it was going to leave a breadcrumb trail of humiliation straight to our doorstep. 

That's when the saw came out.

Into the wee hours of the night we carefully disassembled the tree until it was compact enough to fit into a cardboard box. By 2am we were covered in sweat and sap, but we were able to stealthily discard the box in a nearby dumpster. On that day, we vowed to never again let the disposal of the Christmas tree become an episode of Forensic Files. 

And now my shameful past is out in the open for the internet to enjoy. Happy New Year, all!

TL:DR - Holiday procrastination took a turn for the worse when my apartment became botanical Dexter scene.

"TW!! rape and sexual assault. Hi. idk how to rlly tell my friends so im just gonna open up abt it on here. Three years ago, i was sexually asaulted by my best friend. its been so hard lately and i cant hold it in any longer. Im only 13. and im so scared my “friends” arent gonna believe me or theyre gonn ask things like “what were you wearing?” or “you didnt say no”. what if they invalidate me? im not coming on here for attention at ALL. im coming on here to open up about it. im so scared. not to mention that she was a girl. and im a girl. nobody will believe me if i tell them that it was a girl who did it. now that im done doing all of the “explaining”, i think that im comfortable enough to explain what happened. i was about 10-11 and i was invited to a sleepover at her house. nobody else was invited and it was just me. she was super super toxic and very mentally abusive. i was so scared of her yet i felt like i needed her. anyways, it was about 11-11:30 and she said she was gonna take a shower so i waited in her room but she kept on insisting that i went in with her. so after a while of her pouting and insisting i decided that i should just do it even though i didnt want to. i asked MULTIPLE upon MULTIPLE times if i could just keep my clothes on but she would get all sad and would fake cry so i just did it. she would touch me and rub my back and it was so uncomfortable. she would touch my “top” area and she would kiss my neck and i tried so many times to get out and get my phone to ask my mom or dad to come pick me up but she wouldnt let me leave. she would grab my wrists and cover my mouth making me squirm and cry. she would pin me down and do things to me that i wasnt even ready for. ive been so scared to tell anyone. especially my boyfriend. he means so much to me and im scared hes gonna think it was my fault. im so scared and i havent been able to forget about it and it has left me so traumatized. i think about it every second of every day. what really sucks is that most of my friends are STILL friends with the girl who sexually assaulted me. i hate seeing her everyday. i hate her. i hate her. everytime i think about it i feel so guilty because i hate how i didnt understand the red flags the first time she asked. it was all my fault. if i just didnt go i would be normal and i wouldnt cry everynight. im so scared and idk what to do.",0,"['tw', 'rape', 'and',

"TIFU day 1 of 2021 This morning my mom barged into my room and said she found porn on my flash drive. I could see Satan in her eyes so I played dumb and was like ""what porn, mother?"". She tossed the flash drive at me like it was burning her hand and shouted ""GAY PORN!!!"". I raised both hands like I was under arrest or some shit and shouted back ""I don't watch gay porn, and even if I did, I wouldn't save it on dad's flash drive!"". My mom shook her head and sarcastically asked if I, an only child, had any gay brothers she didn't know about. I shrugged and said ""why don't you ask dad who the porn belongs to?"". We went back and forth for another 5 minutes or so before she gave me the good old ""this ain't over"" look and walked away. 

My dad is at work right now and has no idea my mom is waiting for him to come home so he can confirm what she believes - that I'm a liar who loves watching guys fuck and who's more than willing to frame his own father. I'm kind of stressing out about this whole situation backfiring on my mom when she realizes that my dad might just be getting off to gay porn. Simple as that. Whatever the outcome though, I'm gonna be the bad guy. Fucking 2020 lives on. 

TL:DR My mom accused me of watching gay porn, but I denied it and now my dad's secret might be out because of me.",1,"['tifu', 'day', 'of', '2021', 'this', 'morning', 'my', 'mom', 'barged', 'into',

"I understand why it happens... Ok throughout my life the one kind of women that has actually given me the time and day have been plus sized. I literally don't have a problem with that. I love woman in and shaped and sizes and sexual orientation... I don't think you realize how difficult it is for me to find people I don't find attractive (I'm a Gynosexual) but I've never been given the time and day by someone with a smaller frame. It sounds weird. But they've always been plus sized. Always. I've boiled it down to my personal size. But even then I'm not quite, thin, nor fat. Not quite tall not small.

"TIFU by slamming on my brother's good nature and retroactively ruining a Christmas present  Now I'm not trying to excuse how I acted, but for context I want to say that I've been in a bit of a crappy place the past few weeks because my pup (Tayla) has been ill. Some kind of allergy causing her skin to become ultra sensitive and leading to a lot of irritation that has her almost chewing her own body apart. We were able to get her into a vet for some treatment and she's doing better now, but all we can do is treat the symptoms as the medicine to fix the cause of the problem is in the realm of a few grand, and me and my fiance recently had to self-isolate over Christmas because COVID doesn't discriminate.

We were finally able to see people today and he was one of the first to come around with some gifts of food and a bottle of wine, he stood outside the garden and we stood and talked about how Christmas was in the outside world, how we'd been coping locked away, how Tayla had been holding up. The works. Talking about everything shitty going on had me upset because I'm an emotional bitch when it comes to my pets. He moved on to talk about more positive things to lift the mood, like how most of the family never know what to buy him because his interests are outside of their norm so they mostly just gifted him money and a gag card or gift, and how he finally got a mic stand and HDMI matrix to make streaming more manageable. He only started around a month ago, and none of us were really taking it seriously, but me and a couple friends followed him to bump the numbers a bit.

By this point all the negativity of the past month or so just welled up in me and I snapped. I'm out here scraping together to afford treatment for my beloved pet while he's frivolously spending money on equipment too serious for something he talks about as a hobby? I told him it was a waste of money, and that it was probably a waste of time to stream in general since after a month he hasn't even broken double digits on his followers even though 4 of them are people he knows, so why even do it?

""Ah, honestly the reason is kinda childish and silly. When you told me about Tayla's condition and treatment costs I was kinda pissed internally that I couldn't do anything about it, then I saw a video from Cr1tikal where he talked about how his partner works as a vet and he sometimes funds treatment for owners who can manage alone. I thought it would be cool as fuck to be able to do, and since I'd otherwise be gaming in some of my spare time I may as well put myself out there to see if I can get lucky somehow. Besides, even if I only have a handful of real followers at least there's one or two people out there that I can entertain or make happy.""

The penny dropped and instantly I felt like shit. I knew he loved Tayla almost as much as I do, hell he was the one who accidentally named her when we first got her and I just completely ignored all that in my angst. All I could say was ""Oh. That's pretty cool actually"".

""Nah, it's dumb. I could probably spend my time doing something more constructive if I want money. Either way, my bank finally started letting people get finance again so I've applied for an account upgrade and credit card so I can build a better credit rating. At the end of the day I might at least be able to guarantor a loan so we can get her fixed up and happy! The matrix was a bit lavish, but it was a gift either way. Hopefully I can get some good use out of it so it doesn't go to waste. Speaking of gifts, Eldest Sister should be here soon with your Christmas gift. We pooled together to get you something more serious and less gifty, but we think you'd appreciate this more. Anyway, I've got to go do some editing and waste some more time streaming. I'll see you some time next week for a curry. Maybe on New Year's? Let me know when's best!""

And he just left laughing at his own joke like a dumbass. I sat in the garden with Tayla for a bit mulling over how much of an arsehole I'd been when my sister showed up. We talked for a bit, and she handed me a small box with a tag on it saying ""From everyone"". It was a prepaid debit card. She told me that after I got the news about Tayla our brother had the idea to have everyone in the family pool together to help with treatment. That if he had the numbers right it should be enough to cover 6 months of treatment until we can figure out a way to get the root cause fixed.

So now I'm sat on a late shift a few hours later wondering how our upbringing made one complete bastard and one of the most empathic and generous people I know.

tl;dr I angstily snapped at my brother and shat on his recent hobbies for not seeming to care enough about my dog's illness, but he spent a lot of time since finding out about it working out ways to help us afford treatment.

come around with some gift of food and bottle of wine he stood outside the garden and we stood and talked about how christmas wa in the outside world how we'd been coping locked away how tayla had been holding up the work talking about everything shitty going on had me upset because i'm an emotional bitch when it come to my pet he moved on to talk about more positive thing to lift the mood like how most of the family never know what to buy him because his interest are outside of their norm so they mostly just gifted him money and gag card or gift and how he finally got mic stand and hdmi matrix to make streaming more manageable he only started around month ago and none of u were really taking it seriously but me and couple friend followed him to bump the number bit by this point all the negativity of the past month or so just welled up in me and snapped i'm out here scraping together to afford treatment for my beloved pet while he's frivolously spending money on equipment too serious for something he talk about a hobby told him it wa waste of money and that it wa probably waste of time to stream in general since after month he hasn't even broken double digit on his follower even though of them are people he know so why even do it ah honestly the reason is kinda childish and silly when you told me about tayla's condition and treatment cost wa kinda pissed internally that couldn't do anything about it then saw video from cr1tikal where he talked about how his partner work a vet and he sometimes fund treatment for owner who can manage alone thought it would be cool a fuck to be able to do and since i'd otherwise be gaming in some of my spare time may a well put myself out there to see if can get lucky somehow besides even if only have handful of real follower at least there's one or two people out there that can entertain or make happy the penny dropped and instantly felt like shit knew he loved tayla almost a much a do hell he wa the one who accidentally named her when we first got her and just completely ignored all that in my angst all could say wa oh that's pretty cool actually nah it's dumb could probably spend my time doing something more constructive if want money either way my bank finally started letting people get finance again so i've applied for an account upgrade and credit card so can build better credit rating at the end of the day might at least be able to guarantor loan so we can get her fixed up and happy the matrix wa bit lavish but it wa gift either way hopefully can get some good use out of it so it doesn't go to waste speaking of gift eldest sister should be here soon with your christmas gift we pooled together to get you something more serious and le gifty but we think you'd appreciate this more anyway i've got to go do some editing and waste some more time streaming i'll see you some time next week for curry maybe on new year's let me know when's best and he just left laughing at his own joke like dumbass sat in the garden with tayla for bit mulling over how much of an arsehole i'd been when my sister showed up we talked for bit and she handed me small box with tag on it saying from everyone it wa prepaid debit card she told me that after got the news about tayla our brother had the idea to have everyone in the family pool together to help with treatment that if he had the number right it should be enough to cover month of treatment until we can figure out way to get the root cause fixed so now i'm sat on late shift few hour later wondering how our upbringing made one complete bastard and one of the most empathic and generous people know tl dr angstily snapped at my brother and shat on his recent hobby for not seeming to care enough about my dog's illness but he spent lot of time

"TIFU letting my boyfriend finger me after hot wings for dinner Giving the term fire crotch a whole new meaning


Please send help I made my boyfriend hot wings for dinner and I’m talking HOT wings. 
Fast foaward to a bit ago when we climb into bed and get to touching. Which is all fine and dandy. He gave me head and everything was great. He had also washed his hands precious to all this. And like I said off of oral I felt great no burning or anything. 

But then he started diddling my bits and all still was pretty fine but once he inserted his fingers

OH. MY. GOD. 

I felt the burning start and INSIDE of me at that, then make it’s way to the outside. I immediately had to stop and I’ve tried to make it stop or settle. I thought I was trippin at first like maybe it was just hurting for a second. But when I tell you I felt my cooter go up in flames like a witch in Salem. I have never felt such pain. I knew better. I swear this experience has got me questioning everything right now. 
I’m never making him hot wings again and I’m never having sex again lol EVER 

I’ve tried rinsing, wipes, and a cold rag. 
I just friggin peed and it hurt so bad.

"I'm struggling and my support system is failing me. I've been struggling lately. I lost my job to the pandemic, and went from working 60+ hours a week to having no schedule or sense of purpose and it's depressing and lonely and hard. I work(ed) in the arts so my job was creatively fulfilling as well as time consuming and I feel like I barely know who I am anymore. I also have had a number of physical health issues come up this year (none have been Covid, for the record) .Yes, I know I'm more than my job, and I shouldn't base my worth on my career, but I like what I do and I'm good at it. I know I'm far from alone in this. 

The 3 most important people in my life (Brother, Best Friend, Significant Other) all have diagnosed mental health issues. They try to help but I guess I've been seen as the ""strong"" one who has their shit together for so long. It makes me feel like my depression/anger/general feeling of uselessness and lost sense of self is invalid. Because sometimes the replies are ""Well, at least you're not bipolar!"" as if that is funny or helpful. I mentioned considering talking to a therapist and was basically questioned so much that it demotivated me. One would think that people who have gotten professional help in the past would be more supportive. 

I'm making them sound like shitty people. They're actually amazing and loving and there is a reason they are the most important people in my life. They just don't know how to help me because for so many years I was the one helping them and in a lot of ways I don't know how to tell them what I need. I fear I'm going to trigger something for them and when I have reached out it hasn't been great.

"I feel terrible that I have cheated Hello, 

I cheated on my (now) ex girlfriend of two and half years. We lived together for five months. I am struggling with the fact that I hurt someone who loved me, and that it was in the worst way possible. I am SORRY, embarrassed, and ashamed of myself. 
Just a little back story on how everything happened: 

It was a one time thing. It happened one night. I did not talk to this other girl on phone at all. My ex will probably tell you to this day that I did not talk to other girls on my phone. 
I was at a party with some of my guy friends at my home town. There was this girl there that had a thing for me years ago. To much alcohol was involved and the terrible deed happened. 
After that I instantly left where we were and thought to myself what have you just done! 
The next morning I notified my girlfriend of what I had done and I told her that I was sorry many times over and over. I asked her if there was anything that I could do to make her feel better because we were both in tears. I will never forget that look in her face when we were both in tears. I feel that this will haunt me forever. 

I believe that I cheated out of lust without any real feelings behind it. I want to say that there is nothing I can do or say to justify what I did. I am not trying to say alcohol is the excuse, because it should never be an excuse! At the same time it was a major factor. 

I told my ex if I could go back and change everything I would have never even went to the party in the first place. I asked her if there was anything I could do to help her regain trust in me. I have deleted or unfollowed this other person on everything. 

We are broken up for about five months now and I do not know what to do. I can’t do anything I guess. She has not blocked me on anything I can still contact her. She has made it known that she does not want to communicate though, so I do not talk to her much. Every once and awhile I will call and talk to her. We seem to have good phone calls. The calls usually go on for hours. 

I am really having trouble excepting myself for it as well. When we were together we had talked about cheating and we both agreed that it was terrible. I still think it’s terrible and that is why I am having trouble. 

I would love to be able to make everything work with my ex and to just work on us and communicate better, and regain trust and just take baby steps in our relationship, but as of now nothing is moving forward. I am trying to accept that it may never work out and move forward with everything because I cannot wait forever, but also at this time I just don’t think I can feel like that with anyone else. 

I am not asking for a pat on the back or some kind of praise on how I went about things, but I think that it should mean something and show that I really felt bad and cared. I did not want to lie or hide it from her, because she deserved the truth and she deserved to hear it from me and not someone else. Also this may be selfish but I could definitely not live with the guilt of something like that. 

I am worried that someone new may never accept me. I like to think that I am an honest person. If I was going to lie about something the cheating would have been it. So that will be something that I will bring up in the beginning with someone else. Obviously that is not something I will share when we are first getting to know each other, but before anything becomes official I want the next person to know that, and then they can either except me for my past and that I have changed into a better person or they can walk away without having to be committed knowing something like that. 

I know some people may get on here and bash me and maybe I deserve it, but If there is any advice, ideas, thoughts on how I should move forward with this it will be greatly appreciated.",0,"['feel',

struggling with the fact that hurt someone who loved me and that it was in the worst way possible am sorry embarrassed and ashamed of myself just little back story on how everything happened it was one time thing it happened one night did not talk to this other girl on phone at all my ex will probably tell you to this day that did not talk to other girls on my phone was at party with some of my guy friends at my home town there was this girl there that had thing for me years ago to much alcohol was involved and the terrible deed happened after that instantly left where we were and thought to myself what have you just done the next morning notified my girlfriend of what had done and told her that was sorry many times over and over asked her if there was anything that could do to make her feel better because we were both in tears will never forget that look in her face when we were both in tears feel that this will haunt me forever believe that cheated out of lust without any real feelings behind it want to say that there is nothing can do or say to justify what did am not trying to say alcohol is the excuse because it should never be an excuse at the same time it was major factor told my ex if could go back and change everything would have never even went to the party in the first place asked her if there was anything could do to help her regain trust in me have deleted or unfollowed this other person on everything we are broken up for about five months now and do not know what to do can’t do anything guess she has not blocked me on anything can still contact her she has made it known that she does not want to communicate though so do not talk to her much every once and awhile will call and talk to her we seem to have good phone calls the calls usually go on for hours am really having trouble excepting myself for it as well when we were together we had talked about cheating and we both agreed that it was terrible still think it’s terrible and that is why am having trouble would love to be able to make everything work with my ex and to just work on us and communicate better and regain trust and just take baby steps in our relationship but as of now nothing is moving forward am trying to accept that it may never work out and move forward with everything because cannot wait forever but also at this time just don’t think can feel like that with anyone else am not asking for pat on the back or some kind of praise on how went about things but think that it should mean something and show that really felt bad and cared did not want to lie or hide it from her because she deserved the truth and she deserved to hear it from me and not someone else also this may be selfish but could definitely not live with the guilt of something like that am worried that someone new may never accept me like to think that am an honest person if was going to lie about something the cheating would have been it so that will be something that will bring up in the beginning with someone else obviously that is not something will share when we are first getting to know each other but before anything becomes official want the next person to know that and then they can either except me for my past and that have changed into better person or they can walk away without having to be committed knowing something like that know some people may get on here and bash me and maybe deserve it but if there is any advice ideas thoughts on how should move forward with this it will be greatly appreciated,feel terrible that have cheated hello cheated on my now ex

"TIFU by laughing hysterically in front of my mom First off: To those currently dealing with the current ""COVID-19 Version 2"" (especially England), I am terribly sorry and I hope things get better.

This happened a couple of hours ago.

I was eating lunch while my mom was watching the news today. The first piece of news we saw was that there was this new ""COVID-19 Version 2"" causing chaos in England, where people are desperately trying to leave the country. Well, I didn't know that it was a version 2 of COVID and asked my mom what the news was telling us. She explained that there was this new ""COVID-19 Version 2"" and that it is stronger than the current COVID-19 we have. Now, I am all for dark humor, it is my favorite. I started laughing hysterically in front of my mom because I was laughing at the fact that 2021 will be worse and that we would be in online school, quarantining, and not socializing for another year, maybe even longer. Yeah, after a couple of seconds,  I could see the terror in her eyes and telling me that this is not something to be laughed at. I am truly sorry, and I indeed fucked up today. (Mildy though)

tl;dr: I laughed hysterically in front of my mom because of this ""COVID-19 Version 2"" in Europe.

"I lied online for attention and regret it so much There’s no hiding the fact that I’m young, and prone to making mistakes. But this is probably my worse

I lied online back in December about having an addiction on a throwaway account. Lots of people yelled at me and called me out. It was obviously a very bad lie and about something terrible I shouldn’t have even lied about. It’s been haunting me since and I can’t sleep!

I want to go and apologize so badly for my actions but I don’t remember the user or pass for the throwaway account I made (nor the throwaway email I used to make it).

"My GF and I have this strange arrangement where I am allowed to have sex with her while she sleeps, and I kind of like it more than regular sex This may be weird for some. She's a nurse and works really long shifts and comes home absolutely tired every day. Additionally she takes medication which knocks her out cold, and this was impacting our sexual life because we rarely had the chance to have sex, especially since COVID started. 

I first jokingly proposed to her if I could have sex with her while she slept. Surprisingly she was willing to give it a try. We have been doing this for 8 months now and it's surprisingly hot. Whenever I'm allowed to have sex with her in her sleep, she goes to bed with a babydoll lingerie; this is one of our rules, I can't have sex with her otherwise.

During weekdays she arrives home late at  night, takes shower and her medications knock her out cold in like 10 minutes. She gives me permission to have sex with her around 2 or 3 times a week and it's super hot for some reason. She's completely unconscious, but luckily she's skinny so I can move her around and put her in different poses. Sometimes I put her on top of me and just penetrate her slowly, or sometimes just regular old missionary. Sometimes I also put high heels on her or other lingerie, and a few times I have dressed her up in dress and heels and carry her to the couch and fuck her there lol. I've gotten more creative as time goes by.

I always clean her up afterwards, that's another of our rules.

We also have regular sex on her days off work, but I think this sleep has definitely helped our sex life. She's really chill about it, and asks me how was it, and if I had fun.

"I'm frustrated with my cat right now. It's not all butterflies and rainbows like it may seem. Disclaimer: I love my cat to pieces. She is my first cat as an adult. 

Anyways, 

I'm tired. I'm frustrated. My cat always wants to go outside. She woke me up again at 3am crying to go fucking outside. I opened the window for her slightly so that shut her up for a bit. Whenever I leave, she begs me to go outside. 

I live in a small studio apartment, but am considering moving to give her a bigger home. I let her play outside everyday, but thing is, she loves to climb trees and go across town and explore. I take her for walks on a leash and she has a field day doing that. I want her to be an indoor cat, because where I live, there are lots of poisonous insects and what not outside, so when she is outside, I worry about her getting bit or stung by one of these.

Maybe I should rearrange the studio to make it look like multiple rooms? Idk.

"TIFU by obliterating my family jewels while trying to improve my Jedi skills in VR. Hello reddit, happy holidays! My first TIFU worthy action, wohoo. 

This happened 1 hour ago, I just recovered from the pain enough to post this. 

It all started 4 months ago with me buying an Oculus Rift S for exercising during the lockdown and to play a lot of Beat Saber (fruit ninja on music in VR, look it up, it is really fun). Well, I played like an animal for 1 month then got bored with it and I ended up using the headset once a week on average for the past 3 months.

This all changed on Christmas morning when I found out that my friends bought a Quest 2 for Christmas. Now, we are supposed to meet and spend the new year together all 4 of us and of course we are going to play Beat Saber. It is simply unacceptable for me to not dominate that game and I HAD to get back in shape and train at light sabering blocks on music.

So on the 25th my training started, I quickly got \*back to a decent level and we arrive to the day of the fuckup. I was really trying hard to pass the song Given Up by Linkin Park, it was my 8th try so I got frustrated and had sweaty hands. I never bothered to change the height of the player in the settings so the game thinks I am 30cm shorter. To solve this I stay in a [kind of horse stance](https://imgur.com/a/r2WAhFJ) while playing. The way I hold the controllers is a bit odd since you need to be able to swing it really fast (here's a [preview](https://imgur.com/a/g1J40IB)). Even though my grip isn't too solid, I never worry about it since the controllers are attached to my wrists with a ""safety"" [string](https://imgur.com/a/RmXeyVD). It's not big deal if they slip from your hand (BOY was I wrong).

Here's the fuckup that lowered my chances of having kids (probably for the best, given this IQ display): there were two blocks approaching in the lower front part, both my hands were up so I channel all my frustration and began a mighty swing downwards, when my hands reached the lowest point of the swing and stopped my right controller slipped from my sweaty hand and unsurprisingly continued the arcing motion colliding with the between my legs part, which was completely exposed from my stance. Immense pain ensued, I dropped down, tearing up a bit with the VR headset still on, now hearing the sound of failure in my headphones, and then everything went dark. I'll admit, it took a few minutes until I got up from the ground to resume my misery in bed instead of the floor. Luckily nobody figured out that I was in immense pain for the better part of one hour and it went unnoticed by the people in the house.

Moral of the story? Don't tryhard in a game that nobody cares about just for 3 seconds of glory. Also keep your legs together and change that DAMN setting.

TL;DR:  I was playing Beat Saber in VR, swung my hands down, the controller slipped from my hand and attached by the safety string hit it continued the swinging motion into my nuts.",1,"['tifu', 'by',

"TIFUby forgetting the leave the Discord channel. Last night I was playing Risk of Rain 2 with my brother and we were in a discord channel with one of his friends. I was using discord through my phone since my computer headset died and the charger was too short to use while wearing it. I used my Bluetooth headphones for my phone and when I was done playing I turned off my headphones but forgot to leave the discord channel. I had to work this morning but my brother and his friend kept playing so they stayed on that channel. 

I have a few medical issues and every day I have to do an enema in order to get the poop out of me and my stomach was bothering me so I figured I would do one before bed. I took my phone with me in the bathroom so I could browse Reddit while pooping because it’s boring sitting on the toilet for 10 minutes without it. 

I started doing my enema and proceeded to explosively shit for 5 minutes when I hear a faint voice coming from my phone. I put it closer to my ear and realized it was my brother yelling my name loudly to try to get my attention. I immediately realized I didn’t leave the discord channel and they both just heard me explosively shit for the last 5 minutes and I went to bed wishing I would die in my sleep from the embarrassment...

"TIFU by giving my dog fried chicken bones Not really something that happened today but something that came to manifest over time. My gdad had always warned me not to give em to em out of fear it’ll get stuck in his throat. Yeah no they got stuck in his stomach and colon instead. That’s why this is a fuck up. I was warned and now our family is paying dearly for it. Lost a family member today and I’m just really fucking hurt right now.

Over the past couple months my German Shep, Macx, had really been struggling to poop. At first we chalked it up to constipation so we just changed up his diet to help make his stool a little easier to pass. When that didn’t really work took him to the vet and they said it was is inflamed prostate that was preventing him from pooping with ease. So they gave us some medicine and told us to come back in a couple weeks to check. Well nothing had really helped. Took him to the humane society because they had gotten a grant and were footing the bill on anything you needed, even surgeries. They did a lot of tests and found he had a ton of bone fragments in his stomach and colon and that’s why it was so hard for him. Stuff just wouldn’t pass without it being painful. They gave us some medicine and some food that’ll help with passing the bone. They still didn’t really help. He ate the first couple days and was even able to get some shit out but man you could really tell it was hurting him. He stopped eating after a minute. At first I thought it was the medicine I had mixed in with the food turning him off. But even when I gave it to him by itself he wouldn’t eat. And it’s not like he didn’t like the food, hell the first days he would clear the bowl and wait on more. So took him to the vet today and they said it wasn’t really anything else we could do for him and they had to put him down today. 

He was our family’s first dog. Had him for about 6 years now. Gone way too soon. I’ll always miss you Macxy:(

"TIFU by cheating on an online exam So I had an online Statistics exam, and although, I studied a lot, still had a couple fields of theory that I wasn't really sure of. 

It was an oral exam scheduled to 8 am. 
After an hour of waiting I came finally. The teacher told me that I'm required to agree to being recorded, so if any questions occur in my exam, they can revise it, and they will hold the recording for 6 months. I agreed, I don't suppose I had another choice. The teacher then used R (a statistical programming language) to generate a random number to decide which topic I get questions from. It was the 2 out of the 10 topics about Maximum Likelihood estimation. And then I instantly realised that I miss a lot of the topic, and my inner self started panicking. I didn't even know how to start, I had no idea what the first theorem was, even though I knew it, it didn't pop into my mind. 

Then, my connection to the webinar got really weak, even lost connection, so I opened the e-book for the subject which I studied from, and quickly browsed through it to get a point of what to talk about. My connection then was dropping every 30 seconds for about 10 seconds. Then suddenly the teacher asks me to share my screen. I minimize the window of the book, then started sharing my screen. As soon as I hit the Share screen button, all applications pop up that were launched, including the PDF viewer, which was the first application that was shared. I was so surprised and shocked, I started minimizing all the applications. Then the teacher told me that he can see my screen. I'm not sure if he saw the book being open, or what was in the book. I passed the exam though with the second best grade. But I'm still anxious about being caught cheating, and having it recorded. I might even get fired from university if it gets out, lol.

Around this time, I met a woman who became my light in the darkness and who I openly say saved me from the bad place that my ex wife put me. This woman listened to me and offered advice. I was instantly attracted to her as she is absolutely beautiful physically and in her soul. Over the months, I progressed to a point where I was a completely different person; a more positive and confident man. She even said this to me while we were out for one of our frequent walks. She has told me things about her life, and also used me as someone to talk to. During this, she's told me about her boyfriend of the past 5 yrs and I know how she isn't 100% feeling he is someone she wants to spend the rest of her life with. It was around this time I realized that, yes I was attracted to her, but now I actually wanted to be with her. I constantly think about her, and hope for her happiness. The whole time I have known her, she's never posted a picture of her boyfriend...that is till today. Ever since seeing this picture, I have felt down. I know I shouldn't as I have known about this guy. Not because of my feelings about her, but I can see I am taller and better looking. The only thing I am not is in the same financial situation he is. Ugh... She's sent so many mixed signals in the recent weeks, and flirted with me (and I her) but seeing this picture has me wondering why now. I know if it is meant to be, she has to leave this guy, and I don't know how I can compete with him when he is financially successful and I am just now getting back on my feet.

Sigh...

"I think straight men crossdressing is weird For the record, I have high-functioning Aspergers.

I find crossdressing as a whole to be unappealing, but I respect and support those who choose to do it. It’s their right and they are still equal human beings. I just don’t find the act attractive at all. 

My real issue is that I only really understand and see it as normal when it’s done by members of the LGBT community or those with a sexual fetish for it. When it’s done by straight men for non-sexual reasons, I find it weird and confusing (and a bit uncomfortable).

And no, I’m not a closeted crossdresser. I have no desire to do it myself.

I already have self-esteem, so the idea that I’m being prejudiced wracks me with guilt. 

Now, I have recently done a bit of research to try and understand why straight men do it, but I still feel this way. Even if I understand why, I can’t help but see it as odd.

Again, I don’t see straight men who do it as weird, just the act itself. I still see them as equal humans and respect their freedom to dress as they please. If it helps them somehow, that’s fine. More power to them. It’s just weird to me.

I also find the idea of minors doing it (for whatever reason) really uncomfortable.",0,"['think', 'straight', 'men', 'crossdressing', 'is', 'weird', 'for', 'the', 'record', 'have', 'high',

"TIFU by almost getting my self and my friend killed and my dad arrested for murder (TLDR at the bottom) This didn’t happens today but I’m still gonna tell the story;

so when my buddy Lucas (not his real name)and i where around 17-18 we where really into hunting rabbits, at first we hunted with air rifles because I live in a farm which is 20 meters from town and people used to call the cops every time we used a shotgun, but we weren’t catching anything cause pellets aren’t good for hunting (we where broke and hunting with a 200€ rifle and 2€ pellets). 

        We started making traps and in fact they worked great, the thing is that my family has a dairy farm with around 100 cows (at the time), so every bad smell was attributed to us even though they came from the water treatment facility and the local pig slaughterhouse or every person who also has animals here, but people always said it was us even though we have all the permits and a “poop management system”.
basically if you stand 100 meters in front of the barn you won’t smell anything.
We’ve invited the local authorities and sanitary services to our farm to prove the smell wasn’t from our farm and they all seem to say that’s it’s nothing wrong with us and that neighbors are just assholes.
All of ur neighbors live at least 300 meters away from us, and the nearest house is 500 meters away from the barn so there’s no way they get any hint of smell from us.

One day things changed, there’s always been legends about us, the most of them where about my grandpa who was a ww2 German soldier who moved and became the first forestal engineer in my country, when he retired he built his farm.

There where many legends about my grandpa like that he had a contract with the devil because everything that he planted grew (it was because he used fertilizer) or that we had a snake hatchery and that we fed them with calves, that his dogs where a gift of the devil himself etc...

A day like any other my dad received a letter that said that the neighbors of saruca (the street next to our farm) where suing us and and the cause was: (it actually said this)  “they kill old cows and calves to feed their snakes”, my dad was livid, he couldn’t believe how stupid this was, at first he thought it was some kind of joke so he called the town hall to verify that this was legit and it was.

Some rumors started spreading and people started trespassing to search for proof of our ungodly behavior (obviously they didn’t find anything) so they placed cow and calf bones and killed pigs on our land to make it look like it was true (we don’t even have pigs) and when they couldn’t prove anything people decided to start threatening us, because of this my dad had to shoot a few people who trespassed (he made special shotgun cartridges with sea salt so it’s not lethal but it sure burns like hell and leave a easily recognizable mark on the skin) 

One day I was talking to my dad and he told me how much of a pest rabbits are and that I should hunt them, sooo....I did,  I called Lucas and told him what I wanted to do and before I could ask him he said yes.
The thing is that I forgot to tell my dad what we where about to do, Biiiiiiig  mistake, so at 8-9pm we started setting up our traps and we knew we needed to be quick to check them, otherwise stray and our neighbors dogs might get them first, so Lucas stayed at the farm and around 5:30 we took my truck and went to check the traps.

The milkman, who arrives at that time saw a truck wandering the farm and called my dad, he took one of his shotguns and went to check the wandering truck, we were checking the traps we left on the forest and suddenly I notice him because of the rear lights of his truck and called him;

Me: hey dad what are you doing here ? 
 
Dad: what ? Is that you ? WHAT THE FUCK ATE YOU DOING HERE  !?!?!?!?

Me: we are hunting rabbits like you told me 

Dad: ARE YOU NUTSS!?!?!? WHY DIDN’T YOU TOLD ME !?!?!? IF YOU HADN’t CALLED ME I WOUL HAVE SHOT YOU TWO 

Dad: Jesus Christ..., go home AND NEVER PULL SOMETHING LIKE THIS AGAIN, YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME WHAT YOU WHERE DOING !!!!!!

So we went home and I knew I screwed up and that we could have been shot with those salt cartridges, the think is that later That day out of curiosity I checked his shotgun to see how salt cartridges where and I found out that he wasn’t carrying the non lethal ones, they were real cartridges , that’s when I realized that if I hadn’t called him we would probably be dead and my dad in jail for murder

happens today but i’m still gonna tell the story so when my buddy lucas not his real name and where around 17 18 we where really into hunting rabbits at first we hunted with air rifles because live in farm which is 20 meters from town and people used to call the cops every time we used shotgun but we weren’t catching anything cause pellets aren’t good for hunting we where broke and hunting with 200 rifle and pellets we started making traps and in fact they worked great the thing is that my family has dairy farm with around 100 cows at the time so every bad smell was attributed to us even though they came from the water treatment facility and the local pig slaughterhouse or every person who also has animals here but people always said it was us even though we have all the permits and poop management system basically if you stand 100 meters in front of the barn you won’t smell anything we’ve invited the local authorities and sanitary services to our farm to prove the smell wasn’t from our farm and they all seem to say that’s it’s nothing wrong with us and that neighbors are just assholes all of ur neighbors live at least 300 meters away from us and the nearest house is 500 meters away from the barn so there’s no way they get any hint of smell from us one day things changed there’s always been legends about us the most of them where about my grandpa who was ww2 german soldier who moved and became the first forestal engineer in my country when he retired he built his farm there where many legends about my grandpa like that he had contract with the devil because everything that he planted grew it was because he used fertilizer or that we had snake hatchery and that we fed them with calves that his dogs where gift of the devil himself etc day like any other my dad received letter that said that the neighbors of saruca the street next to our farm where suing us and and the cause was it actually said this they kill old cows and calves to feed their snakes my dad was livid he couldn’t believe how stupid this was at first he thought it was some kind of joke so he called the town hall to verify that this was legit and it was some rumors started spreading and people started trespassing to search for proof of our ungodly behavior obviously they didn’t find anything so they placed cow and calf bones and killed pigs on our land to make it look like it was true we don’t even have pigs and when they couldn’t prove anything people decided to start threatening us because of this my dad had to shoot few people who trespassed he made special shotgun cartridges with sea salt so it’s not lethal but it sure burns like hell and leave easily recognizable mark on the skin one day was talking to my dad and he told me how much of pest rabbits are and that should hunt them sooo did called lucas and told him what wanted to do and before could ask him he said yes the thing is that forgot to tell my dad what we where about to do biiiiiiig mistake so at 9pm we started setting up our traps and we knew we needed to be quick to check them otherwise stray and our neighbors dogs might get them first so lucas stayed at the farm and around 30 we took my truck and went to check the traps the milkman who arrives at that time saw truck wandering the farm and called my dad he took one of his shotguns and went to check the wandering truck we were checking the traps we left on the forest and suddenly notice him because of the rear lights of his truck and called him me hey dad what are you doing here dad what is that you what the fuck ate you doing here

"TIFU by not carrying a spare tire So when I bought this car I knew it didn't have a spare tire. I always meant to get one but kept putting it off. I always kept up with rotations and replaced tires. So here it is 5 years later and I've been driving the same stretch of freeway with no problems. As I'm driving at 5 am to work I hear the sound that a large lifted truck with mud tires makes as it passes you. I look over and no truck. Realize its me making the sound. Pull over, inspect, curse. Call co worker and he is already close to work so no luck getting a ride from him. Call my wife and tell her to pick me up with the truck as I have a jack, jack stand, tire iron in it. Everything I should have in this car that I drive 95 miles a day in, I know I'm stupid.. so she pulled up I pulled the tire off my car, put it in the back of the truck and she takes me to work. I get a ride home from the coworker but as we are passing my car on the opposite side of the freeway we see a CHP writing a ticket at my car. I think ok they just found it I have time! Within 1.5 hrs I'm back to the spot the car was parked on the side of the road with a new tire. Car is GONE. Here's my fuck up. I thought I had 72 hrs or 24 hrs to move my car off the road. Call CHP and it's been towed. Call tow company and they want 185 for the tow and 90 to ""open the gates"".$ 275 and that's what I made at work for the day.

"TIFU by playing tag with my cat and almost breaking my finger  

I have to keep this short because I literally have to run out the door. But my cat and I like to play tag, or even hide and seek, where he'll run and hide and I'll find him. Then I run and hide and he finds me. Sometimes he chases me, sometimes he waits for me to hide. It's really up to him which game we're playing, to be honest.

But, about 5 minutes ago, he was chasing me, ran into the room, he tried to cut me off by shortcutting under the bed, so I went over the bed. I made a mad dash out of the door into the kitchen where I tried to go around the kitchen island. He saw what I was doing and, again, tried to cut me off by going the other way around. I tried to stop, spin, and turn and my hands swung widely. My pinkie finger hit the granite counter top right at the knuckle before the tip. It hurt like hell at first, I thought it was broken. Now I can at least move it so I am convinced it's bruised at worst. If it swells up and gets nasty, then I'll post pics.

"TIFU by telling my boyfriend about a dream where I killed him I know this post makes me sound like a psychopath and I probably am. I have some ASPD symptoms and did some truly fucked up things as a child, but I think I have at least some empathy now and enough self-control that I have not done anything like that in years, though I still have violent urges and fantasies.

Yesterday morning I woke up next to my boyfriend (who moved in with me very recently), turned to him and told him in graphic detail about a dream I had where I violently strangled him to death. My brain hadn't started working properly and I didn't even realize what I had said until I saw the horrified expression on his face. I apologized and he said it was ok but he looked scared and very unconformable. I apologized more and tried to explain that I often have violent dreams but that I would never do anything like that or hurt him in any way. It didn't work and he understandably wanted to get away from the person who had just described herself murdering him, so he said he would go for a walk and quickly left. He returned hours later but was still different and seemed unconformable with me for the rest of the day.

I laid awake on the couch all night because he didn't seem to be able to fall asleep with me in bed with him. He is still asleep and I'm still trying to figure out what I should do or say when he wakes up. I wish I could undo what I said and I hate myself for being this way. Maybe I should wish I had told him everything about myself before we moved in together instead. He would probably have left me but he will probably anyway and wouldn't have to be afraid in his own home. I don't know. I don't even know how he is feeling because even though I understand that it's scary to normal people, it wouldn't be scary for me if the roles were reversed so it's difficult to empathize. I know he definitely deserves better than me.

I don't know why I'm posting this rambling. It's not funny or interesting. It's just sad. I think I'm going to try to fall asleep before he wakes up so I can put this off a few more hours and maybe be less sleep deprived.

TL;DR: I told my boyfriend about a dream where I strangled him to death and now he is afraid of me and know what a fucked up person I am.

Update: We talked about it again today and it went much better this time. I asked him to describe how he felt when I talked about the dream and how he feels about me now. I listened and did my best to empathize. He said that he feels like I really listened to him and understands him and that this was the first time he could tell someone about how their actions made him feel bad without getting a defensive response. He hugged me and said that he feels much safer now. I feel incredibly relieved and think we actually grew closer because of this. I will try to open up more to him as well, but I need to do it slowly and in the right way so I don't scare him again.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'telling', 'my', 'boyfriend', 'about', 'dream', 'where',

"TIFU by ignoring a debt collector. This didn't actually happen today, but was over a long period of time. However, the consequences caught up to me today.  About a year and a half ago I had a some financial difficulties, ran up a lot of debt, and was unable to even make minimum payments.  After several failed attempts to reach an agreement a credit card company I stopped taking their calls and it eventually went to a collection agency. Since I couldn't afford any payments I ignored their calls as well.  

Fast forward to today when a member of the Sheriffs department comes to my place with a civil summons from the aforementioned collection agency.  So now I have 30 days to come up with a stupid amount of money in order to settle out of court or take my chances and try to defend myself in court.

"TIFU by breaking up with my gf while asleep Pretty much the title, I often talk while asleep. Last night my (new) gf woke me up around 4am crying and saying I just broke up with her. Me not knowing wtf just happened could not answer her questions which made her even more suspicious. After 1-2 hours of explaining and reassuring her I didnt mean it and I was talking in my sleep we were fine again, but she thinks what I say in my sleep 'has to come from somewhere'. 
Today we looked it up and I showed her the sites that said that people who talk in their sleep often say offensive things, similar to tourettes. This made her more accepting of the incident. So I lost a part of my gf confidence in me and my night sleep because of talking in my sleep.

750 characters minimum is a lot so ill just write a TLDR:

"Male College Gamers Are The Worst Roommates This is gonna be a bit ranty cause I'm super sick of it. I've lived in 2 apartments since I started university, I previously lived in a 2 bedroom place with a single roommate and now I live in a 4 bedroom. The one consistent thing is there is 1 EXTREMELY introverted gamer roommate. I used to play video games, now I don't cause there's a thing called college. And lemme tell you, they are the worst type of people to live with. 
This is strictly towards male gamers idk much about the female gamer living styles.

These guys were the laziest people I've ever met, constantly leaving dishes and utensils all over the kitchen and sink, trash and napkins scattered everywhere. It got so bad that the rest of my roommates had to implement a chore chart to keep him in line. Guess what, he always picks the end of the week for 2 days. And it's usually dishes(thank god) but he would wait till midnight. The worst part is that if he knew the rest of us were heading home for the weekend, he would leave the dishes FOR 3 DAYS and expect us to clean them. 

I don't fucking get it, are you guys seriously okay with being fucking slobs all the time??? Are you not bothered with trash and used dishes in the sink? How fucking hard is it to rinse a dish and throw it in the dishwasher. I'M ASIAN I DON'T EVEN USE A FUCKING DISHWASHER yet I can still keep a clean space. Clean up after yourself ffs, I'm not your parents needing to tell you all the damn time.

So I kept quiet even when her boyfriend asked if he could pee on me and she allowed him to do so. I have never had a man pee on me. My girlfriend has peed on me before and made me drink it but never a man. As they fucked I fapped quietly and got some jizz on the floor 😨. I guess I’m getting the plunger tonight.

"TIFU by overheating the Family Car on Christmas My mom lives by herself so whenever she needs to be driven around she asks some of the kids in the neighborhood to drive. Cuz well she can't drive. Because she barely uses the car she's always paranoid about it. so... whenever we get to a petrol station (Garage (I'm south African)) she asks the employees to check the oil and water levels.

Your told to pop open the trunk and they open the hot coolant container cap and let all that steam leave. Fill the container with water and tell you to get coolant if your low.

Now little did I know. You should never do this with modern cars. Ours is a 2015 Chevrolet Cruze.

So as a result the coolant container was empty. So I bought some like as fast as I could. It was Christmas eve and I knew we had to travel like 2 hours to go see family the next day. 

The next morning everybody is rushing. So I ecide I should quickly put the coolant in. I open the cap fill it to the recommended max then I switch on the car (for the coolant to suck it in) I check again and everything is good.

But just before I finish coolant cap still off mom starts shouting for me. So then like an idiot I quickly close the hood coolant cap still lying on its container. 5 minutes later, we're moving

About a minute or two into the drive we stop at a light. I see steam near the hood. I look at my brother and he doesn't say anything. I can't see properly outside so I think maybe it's one of the 5 taxis (mini bus taxis are not famous for being in good condition) around us. I think they are blowing the steam onto the car not a big deal.

But I'm still panicking and I think did I close it. I don't remember closing it but I close a lot of things without remembering closing them.look them.look ft 0 8
It's at this point I should've told my brother to stop the car. Because as you know, I didn't close the cap.

For 10 whole minutes I tell myself ""it's fine"" over and over again. While I suspiciously check the temp gauge which is normal. 
Then a code warning flashes. Then I realise it's not fine. 

So I start hintingl like ""hey let's go to a garage or something real quick I need to do something.""

But then the engine starts making a knocking sound. Then he says the car can't accelerate as much as it could as he repeatedly floors the Accelerate pedal. 

So he stops the car and low and behold the Coolant Container Cap is ontop of the container and there is absolutely no coolant in the Container again. (how it didn't fall off surprises me. 

An hour later in the beside the freeway. We fill the car up with Coolant and it all starts leaking everywhere.  

My brother thinks that if we can get to a safe place before the leaking is done it would be better. So tries to start the car and nothing. It just wheezes. Eventually the batter dies and now the car is just dead. 

2 hours later on Christmas day that car is towed back home. No food prepped and Christmas ruined. Thanks to me. 

TL;DR
Left the coolant Container Cap off and the engine overheated on our way to the Christmas family lunch. Spent 6 hours on the cold freeway trying to fix it and eventually giving up and waiting for a tow.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'overheating', 'the', 'family', 'car', 'on', 'christmas', 'my', 'mom', 'lives',

I am always trying to fix it and sometimes I get a normal sleep schedule for a little while but inevitably my sleep gets screwed up again. Well this week my sleep schedule has been awful. Last night I knew I was gonna have to be awake early to sign for my package so I tried to go to sleep early but my sleep was too messed up and I ended up staying awake to 6 am. I thought at that point I should just stay up and get my package. I checked where my package was and it showed that it was in another city really close to me. So I thought ""its 6 am now my package will be here at least by 10 am"". I thought I could stay up another 4 hours easy. So I stayed up and took a shower and made breakfast and sat in my favorite chair drinking orange juice watching Youtube on my phone and scrolling reddit. Well at about 8 am my body decided now is the perfect time to shutdown and engage sleep mode. I slept through and missed FedEx and my delivery. I went on the site and it said they tried to deliver my package at 9:47 am. I was gutted. I have to wait another day for my package now. On the bright side I found another strategy to try and fix my sleep schedule.

TL;DR I have a sleep issue and it cost me to miss a delivery I have been waiting for.",1,"['tifu', 'by', 'having', 'sleep', 'problem', 'have', 'sleep', 'issue', 'and', 'my', 'sleep', 'schedule', 'is',

"TIFU by watching an IUD insertion video with my boyfriend TLDR: My boyfriend and I were planning on having sexy times tonight. I screw it up by watching a graphic medical video with him next to me.

So I've been doing research on birth control methods (22F) and I've been curious about IUDs. I've heard both horror stories and harmless stories about the insertion process, so I wanted to see what it was like. I kept seeing animations, and I, for some reason, wanted to see it on a real body. I looked for medical videos and found [this one](https://brooksidepress.org/brooksidepress/?page_id=209&amp;cn-reloaded=1) (Warning: NSFW, shows the vagina, cervix, blood, and all).

My boyfriend (22M) is sitting on the couch a seat cushion away from me not really paying attention to what I'm watching while he plays some game on his phone. So this video is loading (it's only 5 minutes but my internet is hella slow). So it starts, and this pleasant music starts playing and my boyfriend moves closer, puts his head on my shoulder, and asks what's that? He starts watching.

I was not sure what this video contained. But it goes in LIVE DETAIL. It starts out harmless enough, but then we get to the speculum being inserted and he bolts up right. Turns to me and says, ""The fuck? Doesn't that hurt??"" I assure him it's routine, can hurt sometimes, but is generally NBD. It...continues. The cervical sound gets inserted and he looks like he's going to faint and throw up at the same time. It doesn't help that there's blood after it gets removed; he's a little squeamish. I am not in any way, shape, or form a squeamish person. I don't fear blood. I do want to stress again that I did not know what to expect from this video and I did not want to purposely make my boyfriend feel horrified.   I pause the video and move to get up and he's like, ""No, this is life."" I am adamant that I am not about to clean up his vomit and this is not a way that he has to show some prideful masculinity or something. He tells me to stay and finish it because we might as well follow through. I tell him he doesn't have to follow through on anything because it would be happening to me. He says, ""I know. That shit looks like it's so painful. That metal thing goes INSIDE of you!"" And now I'm all freaked out. So he reaches over and presses play, and we watch the rest.

After the video he and I look at each other and I just nod and he is still speechless, still looks nauseated. I'm back on my search for a good birth control method for me.  A few hours later we're about to go to bed, and I'm still ready for sexy times because...PMS. The video didn't bother me too much. Dear boyfriend on the other hand stops me from touching him right away, looks me dead in the eye, and says, ""I literally cannot get that image out of my head. I'm sorry babe. It's not happening tonight.""

Reddit, I think I've traumatized him. I'm going to talk to him, of course. But I had no idea that it would affect him that much.

ETA: I used a throwaway not because he's on here (he isn't) but because I have family members that know my reddit account and I, um, would rather not share this particular story with them.

"TIFU by not getting a guy's number after getting hit on by him So today I was getting coffee and I was making light conversation with this cute barista. He seemed really into me. Anyway, I was wearinbg a huge belt covered in shiny jewels and he says ""I like your belt it's really shiny"" and I said ""thanks"" and he followed up with ""I wish I could pull it off"". I sort of blushed, I'd never been hit on with a smooth chat up line like that before and I thought this guy was cute, but I was so shy and staggered that this guy was hitting on me that I just smiled, mumbled ""thanks"" and awkwardly shuffled off with my coffee without saying anything.

I thought about it for the rest of the day, but the moment has passed. As someone famous said, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

"When I was 19, I flirted with a 17y/o online. Am I a creep/groomer? Title says it all, but basically when I was 19 I met someone online who was 17, and we talked a lot and slowly over a year or so our conversations got more and more sexual ish. I should mention that no nudes were sent, only the conversation had sexual tones. 
It was consensual from both ends, so neither of us forced stuff on anyone.

We eventually stopped talking due to taking different paths in life (work/education), and we're not fully on the best of terms either due to some arguments unrelated to this (politics argument)

The reason i'm asking is because every time I think about the things I said, I feel horrible now that I am much older. I feel like I was too stupid talking to someone with that age gap, and I feel like I should be put in jail or something. I regret even talking to them about that stuff because it was wrong.

This is a thought that's on my mind 24/7, that i'm a horrible person, a creep/pedo, and that I don't deserve to be 'existing'. 

Every time I see a post on twitter calling out some person who talked to minors inappropriately, I think back to the things I said, and can't focus on anything for the rest of the day because I feel shame and disgust at what i've done in the past. It's also partly the fear of being 'cancelled' in the future, but for me it's 90% the fact that i've done something I shouldn't have done that causes me to lock up.

This has been an issue for me for the better part of a year and I realized I need to deal with this because it's affecting my life negatively. I know asking random internet strangers isn't the best idea, but i'm hoping hearing other's thoughts will help me make the right decision for what I should do to ""fix"" myself.

Are my fears justified?

"TIFU by tossing a package So this happened last week, you know in the midst of all the Christmas chaos. I work for one of those delivery companies that's rather well known world wide. I should also point out that It was my coworkers fault and not mine. 

Anyway I had just finished unloading my truck and was depositing my ""ground packages"" into it's proper bin and taking care of my paper work when there's a commotion coming from the front of the station. 

In comes marching the paramedics and fire department looking for an injured man with the name (for anonymity we will call him ""Jon Snow."" I know not very original or cool anymore, but with my newfound time I've invested in audiobooks. I'm already on book 4. ) 

Anyway I tell them ""oh hang on, there's no injury I know of. Let me go ask my station supervisor."" (I know good lil worker bee me. But seeing as I've been back at the station for a total of 5 minutes, I don't know wtf is going on) 

So I go back out to the loading dock shouting for my boss 

""JIM! HEY JIM, THE PARAMEDICS ARE HERE LOOKING FOR AN INJURED JON SNOW. DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT?"" 

Jim "" What? No, there's been no accident here. Well the shop just closed up, let's make sure there's no one in the customer area."" So he leads the paramedics around the station looking for Mr. Snow. 

Jim proceeds to come back into the loading dock as we are in the middle of our evening sort and have 10 or so minutes to get the truck out to the ramp. 

""Well there's no Mr. Snow here."" 

That's when another coworker chimes in and says 

""Oh you're looking for Mr. Jon Snow? I had a package for him I put over here."" 

Leads the paramedics to the ground bin 

""See right here, here's a package for Mr. Jon Snow."" 

*Paramedics open the package* 

It's a fricken life alert that was pressed, triggered or sounded when it was tossed into the bin. 

Paramedics ""huh well, first time for everything I suppose. Glad no one's hurt and my supervisor is not going to believe this story.

"Does anyone else feel insecure during sex like this? Hi guys, I \[21F\] have always been self-conscious of my lower stomach. Ever since middle school I've tried hard to always suck it in. In high school, I'd always take multiple laxatives to be my flattest for my high school boyfriend. Then I realized years later this was considered bulimic. I still do it sometimes before a hook-up or even drink prune juice to expel (I def felt gassy last time I had sex lol). Sometimes I'll pass up a hook-up because I had eaten a lot earlier that day and don't want to be looked at as ""fat"" or even sending nudes can be awful when I feel ""fat"".

When I'm doing cowgirl, I try not to lean forward as much and I'll admit it sucks when I'm on top and I'd love to be kissing at the same time but I really don't want to lean and hunch my back because then my rolls will just jumble together. Therefore, sometimes I'll ask to have sex in the complete darkness BUT who doesn't like eye contact and seeing their partner's face? The last time I had sex, I was riding and spontaneously changed positions to do reverse cowgirl just so I could rock my hips as much w/o the rolls appearing but I'd much rather be looking at my partner. I'll admit that facing forward and not grinding to full potential reduces the amount of pleasure I can derive. Also, I purposely don't ride anyone's face because I can't image my belly pooch being the first thing they see, sounds like an awful view. My friends def think I'm crazy for being so hyperaware when I'm supposed to be relaxed and completely enjoying sex instead.

The funny thing is that I'm 5'1"", \~100lbs, 24 waist. The pooch isn't awful but it's still apparent. But whenever I see girls of similar size, they have skinnier arms/toned stomachs and a real defined jawline, it just doesn't make sense to me why I can't be like them since I'm pretty petite so I beat myself up for it. I was actually 93lbs a few years ago and while I had the stomach I wanted, I lost boob. It's like I can't win.

Has anyone else felt like this before? Is this insecurity something any of y'all have grown out of? I'm not sure what to do anymore because it's been since middle school. Plus, I would want to completely lose myself during sex but I think this is one of the obstacles stopping me.",0,"['does', 'anyone', 'else', 'feel', 'insecure', 'during', 'sex', 'like', 'this', 'hi',

suck it in in high school i'd always take multiple laxatives to be my flattest for my high school boyfriend then realized years later this was considered bulimic still do it sometimes before hook up or even drink prune juice to expel def felt gassy last time had sex lol sometimes i'll pass up hook up because had eaten lot earlier that day and don't want to be looked at as fat or even sending nudes can be awful when feel fat when i'm doing cowgirl try not to lean forward as much and i'll admit it sucks when i'm on top and i'd love to be kissing at the same time but really don't want to lean and hunch my back because then my rolls will just jumble together therefore sometimes i'll ask to have sex in the complete darkness but who doesn't like eye contact and seeing their partner's face the last time had sex was riding and spontaneously changed positions to do reverse cowgirl just so could rock my hips as much the rolls appearing but i'd much rather be looking at my partner i'll admit that facing forward and not grinding to full potential reduces the amount of pleasure can derive also purposely don't ride anyone's face because can't image my belly pooch being the first thing they see sounds like an awful view my friends def think i'm crazy for being so hyperaware when i'm supposed to be relaxed and completely enjoying sex instead the funny thing is that i'm 5'1 100lbs 24 waist the pooch isn't awful but it's still apparent but whenever see girls of similar size they have skinnier arms toned stomachs and real defined jawline it just doesn't make sense to me why can't be like them since i'm pretty petite so beat myself up for it was actually 93lbs few years ago and while had the stomach wanted lost boob it's like can't win has anyone else felt like this before is this insecurity something any of y'all have grown out of i'm not sure what to do anymore because it's been since middle school plus would want to completely lose myself during sex but think this is one of

"I was a terrible person in high school and did some really shitty things, now I am overwhelmed by guilt I don't remember much of high school which scares the hell out of me because the stuff I do remember is pretty bad. I was a bit of a lunatic, incredibly socially awkward, attention-seeking, and most of all had a very poor perception of what lines I could cross. Im a bit older now and am a truly different person and consider myself to be in a very good place, academically, socially, and physically. Nonetheless, I've done a lot of reflecting this break (mainly because there isn't much else to do while under lockdown), and Im just now realizing how much of a piece of shit I was. I routinely made racist, sexist, gruesome ""jokes"", just for the attention of it. I suppose many edgy teenage boys made the same ones behind closed doors, but I would make them to people at school. Im honestly shocked I was never kicked out or at least suspended, but no one ever reported me luckily, otherwise I genuinely would have killed myself. Worse than this though I routinely made my female ""friends"" and acquaintances incredibly uncomfortable to the point it would surely be considered sexual harassment by some. I never raped anyone or anything, but I certainly made awful comments to people, sexually charged remarks to girls, and behind their backs participated in sharing creepshots and""joked"" about raping people. Overall I pushed boundaries that shouldn't have pushed and I didn't even realize what I was doing was wrong at the time. I think a part of it was the fact I was never told off, most of the time it was an eye roll and an uncomfortable laugh, which I didn't pick up on as negative. Looking back it is starting to make more sense why girls I considered my friends would suddenly began avoiding me, I remember one even refused to work together on projects, and why certain people would stop inviting me to parties. I feel so guilty about all the stuff I can remember, and even worse about all the stuff I cant. Im also nervous some of this stuff will come back to bite me and fuck up my current life, which I am actually doing really good things with. I never did anything bad enough to put me into legal trouble, but there are certainly things that could become a huge hurdle in terms of grad school and employment. I have considered trying to apologize to these people, but I also want to leave the past in the past and not stir up any trouble. Not a day goes by that I don't suddenly remember some interaction and spend the rest of the day embarrassed and guilty over it, and its starting to really fuck me up.",0,"['was', 'terrible', 'person',

"TIFU by waxing my lady bits while drinking scotch So, it’s the holiday season and my usual shop is closed. I’m feeling a bit unkempt and decide this is as good a time as any to tidy the garden. I should have a drink while I heat up the wax, Glenlivet neat. 
So, wax is hot but I’m having trouble seeing my target because I’m a big girl and when I look straight down I see...well, I don’t see *that* so I’m kind of on tippy toes looking into the bathroom mirror. I gently slide the OH GOD DAMN THAT’S HOT wax across my halibut white skin, taking care to just get a small area. Then it dripped off the end of the popsicle stick onto the forbidden zone. Ok, I can cut that out with a scissor, no worry. I slap the paper on there, brace myself with another drink and *riiiiiiiip* the paper off with no wax whatsoever. Is it too cool? I don’t know but let’s add more HOT HOT wax and paper right away. And then another drink and tear that sumbitch off in one yank. So now I’m bleeding in about 5 spots, sticky in 5 more and still mostly hairy. Plus I’m sweating profusely. I should get ice for my scotch so I duck waddle down a flight of stairs to the kitchen for ice and more scotch. 
Back in the bathroom to survey the damage. I look like I have lady mange. At the very least I need to even up the damage. Wax on the other side and PUUUUULLLLLLL. And now I’m crying, and I remember why I tip my esthetician so handsomely.
It’s still stinging like I’ve got underpants full of fire ants and it happened an hour ago. Pro tip folks, leave this intimate grooming to the professionals. 
TL;DR attempted to tidy the hedges while drinking. 0/10, do not recommend

"I’m a 30 year old woman and I’m in a casual relationship with a 20 year old guy It started as a random Tinder date. I downloaded the app again because I was really lonely and needed someone to meet and just to hang out with. I didn’t change the age setting so it was basically 18 and up and I started swiping.

He was an attractive guy with funny pictures and a nice smile so I swiped right. Then I realized he’s 20. He texted me, we started talking and he asked me if I want to meet up. We both get tested for covid regularly so that wasn’t an issue. 


 Since then we’ve had like 8 dates and we ended up being in an FWB situation. I only slept with him after the 4th date or so, he’s not as experienced as me so I thought it’s best to take things slower than with an older guy. 

The age gap is too big for a relationship, I made that very clear and he’s fine with that. 

I like to talk to him, I like to listen to him, he is a great person and we have the kind of chemistry I’ve been missing for years. The sex is absolutely amazing. 

There’s only one person, my roommate who met him and knows about this. She’s not judging at all. 
But I made a post back then on Reddit, asking people for advice on this and I got terrible comments and messages, people telling me that I’m a creep and a predator. I felt like shit even though I know I’m not doing anything wrong. 

That’s it. It feels good to get it out because I started questioning my own judgement and my morals which is something I’ve never done before. I promised myself not to care, I’m gonna enjoy this while it lasts and communicate as openly as before so no one gets hurt. 

I wish a happy 2021 to everyone!",0,"['i’m', '30', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'and', 'i’m', 'in', 'casual', 'relationship', 'with', '20', 'year', 'old', 'guy', 'it', 'started', 'as', 'random', 'tinder',

"Loads of guys out there in the world and in the US are using my Gmail address to register for stuff. They have registered their banks, their place of employment and employment emails, they even registered Mortgage.

One from Singapore uses his utility billing for my email address all because he thinks he owns the mailbox lol.  

Another in Morocco uses his bank which lucky for him encrypts the pdf statements it sends to my email address.

Another one just registered with Allegis Group.  I contacted Allegis to let them know that mailbox is mine and not his and he merely just has same name as me.

Another one in Ohio shockingly had his mortgage closing stuff on a home purchase come to my mailbox.

The list goes on and on and on. I originally in 2006 registered firstname.lastname@gmail.com where firstname.lastname is placeholder for my real name.  And I wonder if I am the only one going through this. 

All the guys using it are Muslim as I have a Muslim name.  But I wonder how Mohamed.Mohamed or Ahmed.Ahmed or Ali.Ali@ are all doing, are they getting similar stuff done to them as I am?

I also get loads of attempts to recover my Gmail, and Google even tells me so.  I had to enable dual factor authentication because of this.  A guy in Sudan was like trying for a whole day to get in and Google constantly popping up a message on my phone ""is this you trying to login"".

What surprises me is how grown men who are IT professionals, or can buy a home, actually end up thinking they own my Gmail mailbox which they never registered for?  Singapore being full of smart working professionals that make high incomes also doing same thing to me surprises me. I know the locations they are doing this thing out of because the emails they register my mailbox to are showing as .sg domain with ""Utility billing"" or banking etc etc.  

Crazy world  The funniest one was of a guy in my own state with same first and last name as me, and I see an email saying he got fired from the job he was at and to call the Staffing agency.  I kindly replied to let them know I am not him.

"TIFU by eating too much fish So, yesterday me and my girlfriend decided we wanted to eat some japanese food and we ordered tons of dogfish sashimi (don't know if this is common in other parts of the world, but here there usually is three main fishes used in japanese food: salmon, tuna and dogfish and I REALLY, REALLY, enjoy the dogfish). We ate and everything was normal.

Went to sleep and woke up today normally. Went to the bathroom to take a shit and noticed there were tiny drops of oil in the toilet just there, floating with my shit, it was a very scary moment and I thought I was very sick. I noticed my underwear was dirty with some kind of oil, as well as my bed sheets.

Did some research and apparently what happened is that dogfish is so freaking oily that your body just cannot process all that oil and just gets rid of it through your ass, where the oil slowly leaks out of you. There is no way for you to notice this is happening, since the oil has the same temperature of your body and apparently your asshole is not tight enough to retain the oil, so it's kinda of an unnoticeable, unretainable diarrhea 

Also, there is nothing you can do to ger rid of it, except waiting...

"I broke all my airplane related toys and lost my interest in aviation after I read about BOAC Flight 911 I was lied to by pilots that turbulence can't cause a plane to crash and ''it's harmless''..

it CAN bring down an airliner - including modern-day aircraft. The  most infamous example is BOAC Flight 911 - a Boeing 707. It was  literally ripped apart in flight at 16,000 feet.

Light to moderate turbulence is harmless to most airliners, however  severe to extreme turbulence can literally rip the wings right off of a  plane.

Don't be fooled by Hurricane Hunter aircraft - those are specially  designed to withstand the worst turbulence mother nature can throw at  them. Airliners aren't built this way because it'd cost money and the aviation industry values money over safety. (737 MAX, anyone?)

Take storms for instance..

The turbulence in those storms can easily exceed the (oh so mighty!) 56 fps design  gust limit of today's commercial airliners.. (Look up FAR gust criteria  for Transport-Category aircraft). 56 feet per second is...38 miles per  hour. This is not operational limits - it's the structural limit -  meaning if there's a vertical or lateral gust exceeding 56 feet per  second and the plane encounters it, it could lose a wing or tail fin.  Happened not once but three times with the B-52. (Elephant Mountain  crash and Savage Mountain crash. All 3 involved Clear Air Turbulence -  invisible to radar...the third B-52 landed safely and did not crash -  however there are photos of the B-52 missing 80% of its vertical  stabilizer)

Airliners (still) are not designed to be able to withstand the worst  turbulence out there, unfortunately... A 707 still has the same G rating  as a brand new 787.

BOAC Flight 911. Braniff Flight 250, Wien Consolidated Airlines  Flight 55, Widerøe Flight 933, NLM CityHopper Flight 431, BOAC Flight  783..

All of these were solely caused by the plane suddenly hitting  turbulence and disintegrating mid-flight..the list is also not  exhaustive, and only includes airliners.

When BOAC 911 (a packed Boeing 707) encountered turbulence while  flying over Mt Fuji, it was like it hit an invisible brick wall. There  was no time to turn back or make a Mayday call..it broke into pieces  pretty much instantaneously. In turbulence invisible to radar..it  spiralled out of control at 16,000 feet after the tail fin, elevators,  wing and all 4 engines broke off. The forward fuselage also broke off  during the dive.

The FAA did not alter airliner design after these accidents, by the  way. The 707 and 777 still have the same G limit they were stressed to  before breaking. The gust criteria has also not changed or experienced  any significant changes since these crashes.

&amp;#x200B;

When I first found out about this when I was like 11 or 12, I broke all my airplane related stuff and threw away all my airplane related games. I had a mini breakdown. I completely lost faith in the aviation industry and just the sight of a plane now still gets me pissed off. Now it looks like the 737 that just crashed in Jakarta broke up in flight due to turbulence.. the Wikipedia article said that the plane might've encountered turbulence and a witness reported something coming off the plane before it dove into the ocean..FFS not again.

&amp;#x200B;

How the fuck is this acceptable. ANY airliner that cannot withstand the worst turbulence is unsafe and shouldn't be flying. Cruise ships can withstand the roughest of waves but a plane falls apart in a bit of bumpy air.. we're not even talking about sustained G forces here but momentary ones that feel like bumps in a road.

"TIFU by accidently showing a colleague a dick pic I had more or less surpressed this embarrassing moment, until I read another FU today with a guy showing his family a video of him and his girlfriend... as you might have guessed, this happened years ago but its still painful to think about!

So when I was younger I liked to take photos/videos of me and my girlfriend during sexy times, unfortunately around the same time we were days away from moving in together. We had recently visited the house and took plenty of pictures - you can probably see where this is going...
I was on a late shift at work with ""Bob"", we had worked together for a few years and got on well, occasionally going out for drinks etc on the weekend. This day was like any other, we were chatting about random things when I mentioned the house. I pulled my phone out to show him some pictures, I had them on fullscreen, slowly swiping through them ""Here's the garden, the garage is full of old junk, front room is decent.."" Awkward silence ""I... umm.. shit"". I swiped across to a picture of my girlfriend with her mouth full of.. well, me..

We both sort of froze for a few seconds while we processed what we were looking at, he just said ""are you fucking serious?!"" and walked off! As I said, we got along well but I was terrified of him reporting me. He came back a few minutes later and just said ""I can't believe you just did that"", I said how sorry I was but the damage was done.
After that night there was always a bit of awkwardness between us, we didn't go out on the weekends again but he didn't report me or mention it to anyone (that I know of). He left the company for another job about a year later.

I haven't seen him since but I wonder what he would say if we bumped into each other now...

"I think I have a crush on a livestreamer and I know it's dumb I began watching this livestreamer about a couple months back honestly because I simply thought she was cute. It was just like that in the beginning, very minor, but I feel that it's grown into something much worse. When she starts her streams, I alternate between watching for a few moments and my video games. When it gets late, around midnight, I usually stop playing my games, then give her stream my full, undivided attention. I'll keep shooting messages in chat hoping she reads them, and when she does I admittedly get happy for a few moments then it just goes back to shooting more messages hoping for another response. I actually stay up pretty late watching her, hoping for some sort of interaction. She's on my mind half the time, I often fantasize about her and think of ways I could get her to notice me, I have a couple of photos she's posted on social media saved on my phone that I just like to look at sometimes... I hate myself for it. I'm not sure if it's a crush or an obsession at this point. I know this whole thing is stupid as there are probably hundreds of guys out there just like me, and I want it to stop, but I like her so much. I honestly feel like the lockdown is partly to blame as well, since the only interaction I've had with a woman regularly has been my mother. I just wanted to tell this anonymously to a bunch of people rather than a one friend or parent. I'm not sure if I should go cold turkey and forget about her entirely, or keep watching her but maybe restrain myself. It's just gotten so bad that whenever I want to do something to get some sort of online presence, I have her in the back of my head, and I want to make something where I hope she notices me.

"TIFU drove the car into an electric fence gate. This actually happened yesterday as one of my few driving lessons. I am in my early teenage years, so I am still trying to get a hang of the car. I had taken driving lessons so I was feeling really confident to start doing chores for my parents. My parents drove first to leave my grandmother at her house and then I took the wheel.

I was a bit nervous cause we had to drive through a route I didnt know much about. Driving up the hill, a car is parked really close to my lane and I proceed to hit its rear view mirror. The guy followed us and as we parked we ended up owing him about 20$

We went to do the chore and I was given the car again to take us back home. I was more familiar with this route and so I got us home with no issues. Fast forward a couple of hours, my dad wants me to take the car again to do the last chore of the day, picking up a shirt.

Drove all the way there with no problems, and then we had to go through some security to get to the neighborhood. My dad already seemed like he was in a bad mood, so I was nervous to say the least. They made us wait for a couple more minutes, which just made his mood even worse.

After a good 15 min, they let me through and this is were it all went downhill. I was pretty sure I was hitting the breaks but the car kept moving and my dad screamed at me to stop the car since the electrical fence gate was still opening up. I panicked, confused at why the car wasn't coming to a stop I changed my foot from the break, to the pedal. 

This went as bad as you can imagine, the huge door that was opening infront of us, had yet to be openend completely and so I drove right into it and basically slammed it open. My heart was racing and I was basically in shock. I managed to stop the car but the damage had already been done.

We're still waiting for the total cost of the fence gate, but its safe to say I wont be driving again any time soon. Due to this little accident, I will also be missing my senior trip due to the costs of repairing the fence gate and repairing the damage done to the front of the car. Living in a 3rd world country, the price of those motorized gates will be quite high.

"I had a psychosis ok for a couple of months i’ve been avoiding this because I didn’t know what it was, I honestly thought it was some type of strong panic attack that I get every time I do drugs but really after doing research today and in the past. it was a psychosis. and which I would honestly say it was the most live changing and WORSTTTT event ever to happen in my life.

so this was the other day when me my friends took caps and smoked Durban Thai later which not to mention is so strong and sooo smelly like it was unbelievable, i left it my draw when I got home and it stunk out my room. anyways having caps and smoking late at night, I had put myself on a break from weed so smoking this while on caps and being the light weight that I am 
IT PUT ME ON ANOTHER DIMENSION AND I FEEEL extremely sorry for my friends putting up with me. I dont remember what I did exactly, because in my reality then, nothing was real.

it is the and was the most scariest period of time and lasted all night. 
if i had to put what a psychosis feel likes into words, it’d be that you feel trapped, and you feel like you know so much that your in trouble and that everything worry’s you because you don’t want to worry anyone. and you don’t how to respond because your mind feels like it’s racing thoughts 1000 thoughts per second so all you can comprehend is fear
nothing but fear

everything said that night was in my head, I couldn’t specifically hear anything except my thoughts, so i’d thought about something. I would hear it. BUT IT WAS SO HARD TI FOCUS
and the most scariest feeling you could ever get.

I’ve now been so careful ever since because I have depersonalisation and mad anxiety towards trying to avoid psychosis’s  from this night. like if i was to speak about this whole thing. I would have to write a book.
and I’ve already written so much on here already

anyways just thought i’d confess because nobody actually cares in real life enough. so for those whoses had a psychosis or wants to know  partially about experiencing a psychosis, here u  go ig

I will never ever wish this on someone.
and while being high it made everything 100x worse
I cant remember anything real from this night
I didn’t explain everything I wanted to on here but if anybody wants to know more pls msg me :3 or even if u could relate or help with anything because i’ve had persistent short psychosis feelings ever since and I absolutely hate it smmmm",0,"['had', 'psychosis', 'ok', 'for', 'couple', 'of', 'months', 'i’ve', 'been', 'avoiding', 'this', 'because', 'didn’t', 'know', 'what', 'it', 'was',

"I don’t like leaving my back to people whilst I’m doing something at a counter because when I was 15 a man at work grabbed my waist whilst I was folding napkins at a counter. It only just hit me that that’s why I hate standing in that specific position. Whenever someone comes up behind me I always flinch my whole body and brace myself to be touched before quickly spinning behind. I don’t know why it’s taken me this long to connect to two but I think realising the reason will help me.
