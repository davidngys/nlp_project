t3_kvjlmn,TIFU By accidentally being racist to an Asian friend.,"Today I fucked up by being racist to my Asian friend. 

If I were to describe myself culturally, I would say I'm the ""Renaissance man"" type. I'm a humanist by nature &amp;amp; and a philanthropist through interest. 

Now if I were to describe my humor, I would say I'm a cross between Jim Carry &amp;amp; Dave Chappell. A couple of my two favorites comedians!

So with that said. I tend to take joy in being involved in the different cultures of the world. I don't have a single negative idea for any culture at all.. because they are all cultures of man. (Maybe a bit hippy.. I must admit...) So the Dave chapel part comes into play because I find humor in cultural cues &amp;amp; ticks.. things that set us apart but make us the same all in all. 

So I met with my Asian friend a few days ago to take some photos of his flipping sweet new haircut. See, This is where I get people in my grips. I have their full attention &amp;amp; can speak into them; if they are open to conversation that is. A normal conversation typically revolves around advice giving &amp;amp; guidance into the future. It's all about building people's confidence up.

Well, after the photo shoot i do my thing &amp;amp; organize some of the photos we had just taken. 

I send him two samples images with different lighting, with a simple question;

Me: ""Hey which photo feels more like you?""

Asian friend: ""I like the darker one better!""

Me: ""Ah yeah! I forgot you where Chinese &amp;amp; not Korean!""

(....A few minutes pass.... When it dawns on me that I just said something completely stupid. The whole Asians look alike scenario hits me like a Mac truck in the rain.)

Me: ""^^ In regards to face whitening!""

Me: sorry

.... two hours pass

Me: ""So uh, that joke was not funny at all. I'm sorry to even have said it. I got caught in the moment trying to be funny""

t3_kvjgp0,TIFU by ordering dish towels from Amazon (NSFW),"Obligatory this happened about 30 minutes ago and I‚Äôm not sure I will ever recover. 
I ordered a sex toy from amazon and it shipped through Fedex and the Fedex people couldn‚Äôt find our house. (we live in AK where the house addresses can get weird) so I had called twice and made 2 reports to them that my package is still not here. Well this time the guy I was talking to from customer service was named Juan and Juan did not speak very fluent English but was still trying his best to help me out with this missing package. It‚Äôs not his fault our Fedex driver is having issues. So Juan and I are having a grand ole time trying to track my sex toy when he asks okay I need you to answer some questions for a new report. I say okay sure and he goes ‚ÄúWHAT ARE THE CONTENTS??‚Äù I froze and said um can you repeat that?? And he said ‚ÄúWHAT ARE THE CONTENTS??‚Äù Well Reddit, this thing is called the ‚ÄúSatisfier Pro 2 Air-Pulse Clitoral Stimulator‚Äù and I CANNOT tell Juan that those are the contents. So I panicked and told him that I ordered dish towels off of amazon?? I feel like maybe he could see what I ordered though somehow? I will never know but we finished the report for my dish towels and I gave Juan a 5/5 star rating on his customer service review and now I‚Äôm never ordering a sex toy online again. Maybe never ordering anything at all from Amazon ever again. Especially dish towels. 

TLDR: Told Fedex customer service representative I was ordering dish towels when in fact I had ordered a ridiculously named sex toy.",4,2,tifu
t3_kvj1zy,TIFU because I told the teacher I like drugs,"Pretty short story... my math teacher was getting pissed at the class because they were playing video games in class. They were all playing among us without her even knowing about it. She walked by one of them and saw and then started lecturing us. So she said ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt play video games all the time because they can get you addicted. If you get addicted then you‚Äôre distracted and you can‚Äôt pay attention to the important things in life. It‚Äôs like a drug. And just like drugs, they can cause major problems.‚Äù So I responded and said ‚ÄúI kinda like drugs.‚Äù The entire class laughed but the teacher was pissed and started giving another lecture. Then she gave me detention. So now I have to sit next to the guy that shit on the bathroom floor, and the entire class is pissed off too because I got them lectured. I really fucked up.

TL;DR:

So to sum up. The teacher gave us a lecture on why you shouldn‚Äôt get addicted to video games, and I turned her entire reasoning on her by saying I like drugs. She gave me detention, and everyone‚Äôs pissed off at me.",2,2,tifu
t3_kvih6z,TIFU by losing my phone and getting picked up by campus police,"This actually happened fall semester of 2004. I 19f (now 35) had led a pretty sheltered life at home. I had no social life before college and had a lot of restrictions. Needless to say I  rebelled. 

I was meeting guys online. If things happened they happened. This particular night my Sophomore year of college made plans to meet a guy just off campus. He was a tad older but nice. 

It wasn't until we were a mile away from my dorm that my heart sunk. My phone was gone. At the time I had a flip phone with one of those plastic clips that you clip to your pants. 

We searched for it calling it with his phone. After awhile we gave up and continued on. Dumb on my part I know. We get to the house which I found out was actually his mother's ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. That killed the vibe but I hung out. 

We were watching TV in his room when I see red and blue lights dancing on the wall. We look out the window and two police cruisers are parked outside. There's a knock on the bedroom door. 

There stood two campus police officers. They address me by name and tell me I'm coming with them.

Before this point I had never done anything this stupid. I remember asking the one that drove me back to campus if he knew my aunt.

He told me she was waiting for me at the station. My aunt (maternal) worked at the university for the Greek life/ student life dept and worked closely with campus pd.

By this point I know I'm in deep sh$t. We walk into the pd conference room and there sits my aunt. I'm screwed.

""You missing something?"" She asked pulling my phone from her pocket.

Someone had found my phone right outside my dorm. When they tried to locate me in my room and found me gone they called home. And in turn my mom called her sister.

Using her position my aunt had the police track the guys phone and pinpointed the location to come pick me up. Turns out the guy had a non violent record and was known to the police

My parents were furious. They were paying for school. I ended up going home that weekend with an emergency session with my psychologist.

When I returned to school I had to check in often and my aunt got me a job with the student run security escort service. Which I worked from Jan 2005-Dec 2007 when I graduated. To keep me out of trouble.

It was my biggest FU in my life.

TL;DR met a guy online, lost my phone and used his to call it. Campus police tracked his phone after my university employed aunt requested it. They came and took me back to campus. Guy had record.Was in deep sh$t with parents.",0,0,tifu
t3_kvif4c,TIFU by setting out a digital picture frame,"TIFU by setting out a digital picture frame

&amp;#x200B;

It was an honest mistake, though. And there was nothing pornographic on it. It wasn't even on.

&amp;#x200B;

Several years ago we had a third person in our family. We were all happy. Things were getting on. She worked in IT, I was a house-husband, and our bestest wife had just had our second child. For reference, I'm 'A', the mama is 'B' and the third is 'C'.

&amp;#x200B;

C had been transitioning MtF when things slowly started to fall apart. Her therapist (from what B and I could gather) was telling her we weren't good for her (C) mental health. It was the verbal fighting, you see. B and C argued a lot. C had been running a business the previous ten years, and B had put off exploring a lucrative job in New York in order to help make the business work. B put aside her specialized degree, after much deliberation, to make the business work and bring money to our home.

&amp;#x200B;

B did all this business running while C worked IT via contract. At that contract job she had a desk. At that desk she had a digital picture frame to cycle through pictures of the three of us. Then the four of us when our first child arrived. Then the five of us after the second child. All the while I kept the SD card updated with images, C being happy to have them, B happy to hear about them.

&amp;#x200B;

But all wasn't happiness and sunshine. C demanded B do things for the business that B argued against. When B would make suggestions, C would say 'okay' and ignore them, or she would outright do whatever she wanted. Only after B shouted her way into the workspace (all while working to make the business successful) would C acquiesce to B's recommendations. Ten years of that caused B to resent and lose all hope for she and C to have any sort of heartfelt relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

For me, it was 'business as usual'. I was suffering with depression and not working outside the house, so had to make myself useful at home. It was difficult, dragging my half-dead carcass out of bed each day. My lack of motivation was confusing for everyone, including me. My relationship with C never really flourished after the first couple years. We barely touched. We didn't share more than a couple interests. I've always been an introvert, so having to change my mental comfort for someone who didn't think about my comfort was difficult. I just didn't do it.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, several centuries ago, at the end of 2019, C decided she didn't want to be with us anymore. Really out of the blue, no indication or communication or anything. Just the ""I've got something to tell you both"" bad news Talk. And we were devastated, B and I. While living out of Mother's house all of 2020, we found a new place, a new life. We moved on, leaving the pain of the old house behind us. The only reminder the children wanting to talk with C frequently. And C providing us with some child support (after being reminded, each month). B was done with C's callous, innocent forgetfulness, as well as her self-centered prioritizing of our relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong. We supported her transition and did everything that was necessary. But she pulled away from us.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday: I hear from across the new house: ""WHY do we have this picture frame!"" The tone is dreadful and agitated and almost angry. My instant response, ""Because we do!"" wasn't welcome. I'm never in the mood to be shouted at, especially with an angry tone for something I've no basis in having responsibility. I hate being yelled at, thanks to my mother.

&amp;#x200B;

So we yell it out, over the day, over different things. She never understands why I act defensively when I'm being yelled at, and acts hurt or offended when I yell back. (We're doing therapy this year, I swear by Odin's eye!) She asks what's wrong with me, I ask what's wrong with her. I consider leaving. I don't.

&amp;#x200B;

Today: She tells me how the picture frame makes her feel.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh.

&amp;#x200B;

Duh. Of course. Why didn't I think of that. Of course all those bad feelings and memories would be drudged up by that specific device. It's gone now and I apologized for ever packing it on our trip to the new home.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I need to think about what else is waiting for us in the moving boxes.

&amp;#x200B;

Much TL;DR: I put out a digital picture frame we had given our ex, and it brought back all the negative feelings towards the ex, of which I bore the brunt.",0,1,tifu
t3_kvibr2,TIFU by shooting my partners cum in his mouth,"My partner (21 M) and I (21 F) have not seen each other in over a month. He has been visiting family over his winter break in college. Today was the first time getting to see each other since he left. We have not been sexually active together for a long time so, I have yet to suck his dick. This was not my first time giving head. I have been complimented in the past for my work so I was excited to show him. So anyway, we are getting into it and I ask him if it is ok to go down on him. He agrees and I get to work. He is lying flat on his back with me on top of him. It does not take long until he pulls my head away signaling he is going to cum, he also sits up slightly in his seconds before orgasm. I continue with my hand until he begins to cum, not thinking much about where it will end up. As soon as he starts cumming I am reminded how much of a shooter he is. This man shoots his load farther than anyone else I have been with. Just as soon as that thought pops into my mind, I look at him and see his cum shoot directly into his mouth. We immediately start dying of laughter. I have always wondered if this exact thing ever happens to people, and today I got to experience it first hand. The situation gave us a really good laugh but I felt bad for him because his orgasm definitely was not enjoyed like I intended

t3_kvhy76,TIFU by watching an IUD insertion video with my boyfriend,"TLDR: My boyfriend and I were planning on having sexy times tonight. I screw it up by watching a graphic medical video with him next to me.

So I've been doing research on birth control methods (22F) and I've been curious about IUDs. I've heard both horror stories and harmless stories about the insertion process, so I wanted to see what it was like. I kept seeing animations, and I, for some reason, wanted to see it on a real body. I looked for medical videos and found [this one](https://brooksidepress.org/brooksidepress/?page_id=209&amp;cn-reloaded=1) (Warning: NSFW, shows the vagina, cervix, blood, and all).

My boyfriend (22M) is sitting on the couch a seat cushion away from me not really paying attention to what I'm watching while he plays some game on his phone. So this video is loading (it's only 5 minutes but my internet is hella slow). So it starts, and this pleasant music starts playing and my boyfriend moves closer, puts his head on my shoulder, and asks what's that? He starts watching.

I was not sure what this video contained. But it goes in LIVE DETAIL. It starts out harmless enough, but then we get to the speculum being inserted and he bolts up right. Turns to me and says, ""The fuck? Doesn't that hurt??"" I assure him it's routine, can hurt sometimes, but is generally NBD. It...continues. The cervical sound gets inserted and he looks like he's going to faint and throw up at the same time. It doesn't help that there's blood after it gets removed; he's a little squeamish. I am not in any way, shape, or form a squeamish person. I don't fear blood. I do want to stress again that I did not know what to expect from this video and I did not want to purposely make my boyfriend feel horrified.   I pause the video and move to get up and he's like, ""No, this is life."" I am adamant that I am not about to clean up his vomit and this is not a way that he has to show some prideful masculinity or something. He tells me to stay and finish it because we might as well follow through. I tell him he doesn't have to follow through on anything because it would be happening to me. He says, ""I know. That shit looks like it's so painful. That metal thing goes INSIDE of you!"" And now I'm all freaked out. So he reaches over and presses play, and we watch the rest.

After the video he and I look at each other and I just nod and he is still speechless, still looks nauseated. I'm back on my search for a good birth control method for me.  A few hours later we're about to go to bed, and I'm still ready for sexy times because...PMS. The video didn't bother me too much. Dear boyfriend on the other hand stops me from touching him right away, looks me dead in the eye, and says, ""I literally cannot get that image out of my head. I'm sorry babe. It's not happening tonight.""

Reddit, I think I've traumatized him. I'm going to talk to him, of course. But I had no idea that it would affect him that much.

ETA: I used a throwaway not because he's on here (he isn't) but because I have family members that know my reddit account and I, um, would rather not share this particular story with them. ",18,7,tifu

t3_kvheci,TIFU by accidentally teaching a 7th grade student about the phrase ‚Äúeating ass‚Äù,"I assume everyone remembers PEMDAS from math class. It‚Äôs the magical acronym that I teach all my young mathematicians to help them remember the order of operations (parenthesis, exponents, multiplication...). 

PEMDAS is also commonly associated with the phrase: ‚ÄúPlease Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally‚Äù. This also helps my students remember said order.

Well this year I decided we were going to do something different. Instead of saying ‚ÄúPlease Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally‚Äù, I challenged my students to come up with their own phrase because not many people actually have an Aunt Sally and it‚Äôs not relatable. I want the kids to own it and make it relatable to them, so they remember it during a test. 

Amongst all the usual childish submissions I get for activities like this, one stood out: Please Eat My Delicious Asshole Salad. 

I was shook. For a second I froze up, but then immediately took his paper, put it on my desk and gave this student the dreaded ‚Äúcome see me after class‚Äù.

Class ends, the student approaches my desk and I do my best to glare deep into his eyes to emphasize how serious I am taking this matter. I start to ask him why he wrote what he wrote, why he thought it was funny, where he learned this phrase and so on. He stares back at me confused, but confident in saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see what is so wrong with what I wrote...‚Äù 

I explain to him that not only do we NOT use the word asshole, we DEFINITELY don‚Äôt use phrases of a sexual nature such as ‚Äúeating asshole‚Äù in my classroom. I tell him that this won‚Äôt be tolerated and that he is going to see the principal right now. 

Even more confused, my student looks at his paper and says ‚Äúbut that doesn‚Äôt say asshole....‚Äù

I‚Äôm mortified, I‚Äôm terrified, I‚Äôm embarrassed, I‚Äôm confused. I start to backpedal and ask him what he wrote. 

He says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry my handwriting is really bad, but I wrote: Please Eat My Delicious Apple Salad. I didn‚Äôt write the A word. I wrote Apple‚Äù

And that is how I accused my student of referencing ass eating during a math assignment. His handwriting was so shit that I thought Apple said Asshole.

TLDR:
Student‚Äôs bad handwriting made me think he wrote ‚Äúeating asshole‚Äù instead of ‚Äúeating apple‚Äù during an assignment.",54,15,tifu
t3_kvhchr,TIFU accidentally telling an old woman she was going to die,"This happened a few years back now but I haven‚Äôt forgotten about it since.

I used to work in a bingo hall in the UK which, for the uninitiated, is a large entertainment establishment where anyone of legal age (18+) can risk their well earned cash to have a chance to hit the jackpot in a few games of 90 ball bingo. It is a well known leisure activity that attracts a generally older customer base.

The longer you work there, the more you see a few repeat customers which you will eventually learn the names of to have a conversation and a bit of banter with. The standard entertainment based customer service.

During that fateful day a lovely older woman had won during the bingo and was claiming her winnings with me in the Booksales area. 

As I was cashing out her winnings for her she slipped into our chat that her adult son had unfortunately and suddenly passed away a few weeks prior and this was the first bit of luck she felt she had had since and that she couldn‚Äôt believe he wasn‚Äôt there with her. I had known her for a few years prior to this as she was quite a regular and after my initial, ‚ÄúI am really sorry to hear that‚Äù I wanted to add something that might‚Äôve given her a bit of comfort by showing a bit of empathy.

My first thought was to suggest that I believed that no matter how long had passed that we all see each other again in some sort of way, to keep as positive as possible and that I am thinking about her at this time. 
My brain wasn‚Äôt as eloquent however and as I handed her the winnings over I said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll see him again soon‚Äù as she walked away.

As she returned to the main hall my brain had finally caught up to the horror show my mouth had just thrown out. My colleagues who had overheard were roaring with laughter.

I grabbed a box of chocolates from the store cupboard and ran into the hall frantically searching for an old woman with white hair and a cardigan in a sea of old women with white hair and cardigans until I eventually found her. I apologised profusely and explained what I had really meant to say and how I was mortified. Thankfully she saw the funny side to it and accepted my chocolate based apology.

I now always try to think before speaking... I doubt it has worked.

t3_kvh4m6,TIFU Getting so drunk and high I accidentally shit in my basement laundry tub.," Throw away account because... Well, you'll read.

My wife and I were out with family at an annual new years eve party. My wife doesn't drink so after me doing multiple shots, eating spiked cherries, a good amount of beer, homemade coquito, sipping on moonshine, and smoking weed, she drove us home. But before we leave I pop a generic, high dosage, Viagra so we can start the new year off good. Once home and kinda feeling like I needed to take a shit, I went to the one and only bathroom we have in the house. So I sat there for a few minutes or an hour but nothing came out. We have a bidet so I put it on enema mode thinking that might help pressure wash the stubborn poop out of me.

So the way enema mode on our bidet works is, you relax your butthole and water that's got the same pressure as you would use to remove 3 layers of graffiti from the third floor of a brick building sprays up your ass. You wait until you feel full then push the water out. You keep doing this until the water is clear on the way out so you know you're clean inside.

Still nothing though. So before my legs go numb, I decide to call it quits. Maybe its just the combination of alcohols, weed, and full strength boner pill. My wife puts our daughter to bed (which consists of my wife laying down with her until she falls asleep). I get our love making session ready by putting water proof mats on top of the bed and warming up coconut oil. My wife says she's going to get into the shower so I realize my daughter is asleep and now our party is about to begin. I went to the basement to do a quick bump of booger sugar to stay awake and prolong our sex. While chopping up, I push a little fart out. Oh fuck I just shit myself. Drunk, high, and scared my wife heard me scream, I grab some kleenex to wipe my ass and there's a splash of brown water in my underwear. Wipe, then proceed to run around like a chicken with its head cut off wondering where I'm going to put my shitted up tissue. I find some a plastic shopping bag, run upstairs to bury that bag in the garbage, change my drawers and check to see if my wife is on alert. Still in the shower, she has no clue so I run back downstairs to do my bump and change my diaper. While changing by the laundry room, I feel another fart. So I hang my ass over the stationary tub push out the ""fart"" and out comes a watery oatmeal like consistency of shit at roughly the same rate as the rockets SpaceX is using to take humans to Mars.

Now, I'm scared that my wife will come downstairs and ask what fuck I'm doing naked with a laundry tub full of shit but I'm laughing so hard because I'm thinking that my wife will come downstairs and ask what fuck I'm doing naked with a laundry tub full of shit. I proceed to wipe my ass multiple times, find another plastic bag to fill up, then go to the task of running water into the tub to mash up the bigger pieces with a laundry cup and rinse my poop soup down a 1"" hole. All the while wondering what my life has come to and if this is what I thought being an adult would be like when I was a boy. With that job accomplished, I go back upstairs to get into the shower to clean up and have sexy time with my wife who probably knows she's married to an idiot. She just doesn't know how high of a level I'm on.

TL;DR Got drunk, and high and thought a fart was just a fart. Shit myself and in the laundry tub.",28,14,tifu
t3_kvgmed,TIFU by drinking my sister‚Äôs coffee,"

Obligatory didn‚Äôt happen today. 

A couple months ago, I was on a roadie with my sisters and 2 year old nephew. It was mid winter in the Midwest and they were naturally snotting up a storm (Important later). When we stopped to get gas, I went in first, then came back to the car to sit with my nephew while they did their business.

Well, I was thirsty, and the two cups of coffee from this morning were still in the cup holder upfront. Not afraid of some lukewarm coffee, I reached forward and took what felt like a 1/4 full cup of coffee.

I drained that bitch, noticing it had sort of a weird texture?? Like??? A little chunky, but assumed it was just sugar clumped up or something.

My sisters came back to the car, saw me with the empty cup, and subsequently died of laughter.

While I‚Äôd been in the gas station my sisters- yes, both- had spit lugies into it. 

So yep, that‚Äôs how I fucked up drinking coffee

Make sure to read it first, or read the TL;DR at the bottom of that post.

So, after all those events happened, I thought that everything was over and they will forget about this embarassing thing. Well... they did but... lemme tell the story.

So, last week on Tuesday, I had another Zoom call with 4 other girls this time. All of them ""witnessed the event"" of the previous post. These 4 girls include Emma too.

So, we were just casually talking about random stuff (they didn't mention the events if the prev call at all), when I got a notification. One of the girls in my class (let's call her Jessica), who's a really big memer, sent me the following message: ""Nice cock, bro""

I was confused. She wasn't in the last call, how does she... and then I got it... I read the message again, this time so that they can hear it too. Then, one of the girls (let's call her Barbara) admitted, that she TOOK A PICTURE of me naked.

But not only that. She told the entire story to ALL GIRLS in my class SENT THE PHOTO into their group chat (there's an only-girl group chat apparently)!!!!

This time, was very angry and I showed it to her. I shouted and all and went on a rant for about 10 minutes. After I finished, she just said to me, face-to-face (kinda) that ""You never said that we ahouldn't do that"" and ""You fucked up, we now havw thw rightscro do anything with your fuck-up!"" ans atupis shit like that.

I got enough of it, told her that I hate her and I actually left this time, I was so angry. So now, ever single girl in my class saw a picture of my penis. Every. Single. Girl. I felt so bad about - and still do.

On Thursday, we had another Zoom call. This time, there were only 3 girls with me. Emma and two others, the same who were also in the previous call and the call where the events of my first post happened.

So, I was still feeling angry and also, sad. In the first 15 minutes, I didn't say a thing. Then, Emma (who was wearing a very tiny bra this and last time as well, now without any excuses) says the following:

""I'll cheer you up, OP. First, be happy that everyone saw your penis, it's a grand one, I'm pretty sure girls loved it. Second...""

Then, she took off her bra with a fast move. I saw her boobs for a split second, but I didn't feel like she had to do this, and I also knew what she wanted to achieve with these actions (mentioned in the prev post), so I quickly closed my eyes and looked away.

Then, she tried to convince me to open my eyes and look at the screen, but I just didn't do it, no matter what she said. Then, she saw that she cannot make me do it, so she left. We didn't talk much after, and within 5 minutes, everyone else left too.

Since then, not much happened. One thing worth mentioning is that another girl from my class sent me nudes, but I deleted the message without looking at it.

I'm not excited for the story to continue.

TL;DR: A girl took pictures of me, sent it to all girls in my class. I was feeling bad, another girl showed me her boobs to cheer me up, but I looked away cause Im a gentleman. I also got nudes from another girl, but I deleted the message without lookingbat",0,9,tifu

There was a boy I went on a couple of dates with. He made me feel some sense of acceptance. Turns out we had to split up; he wanted a fwb and I wanted to go on dates and we would never be able to reconcile our differences. I wasn't that sad about our split, but it did awaken a lot of old pain of rejection. He didn't want me romantically. It hurt and I spiraled in a feeling of worthlessness that I wasn't able to pull myself out of.


I started running around and scrambling for a feeling of acceptance. I went on discord servers and stayed on call for hours and hours to quench my fear of being alone. I contacted old friends and when they heard from me again, their happy reaction soothed me a little. I also messed around on twitter and reveled in the likes and replies.


Here comes the mistake. I discovered the gonewild subreddit. For those who don't know, it's a place for people to post nudes publicly. It's quite a huge subreddit. I was attracted to it because I missed all of the compliments my date used to have on my body that gave me a feeling of approval. I also have an exhibitionist streak. I figured I would try it. I posted on gonewild and couple similar places, without my face and with a neutral background.


At first, it was amazing. A flood of horny messages and approval, people asking me for sex, for where I was, people desperate to see me and be around me. Upvotes and followers. It was definitely a high.


Now though, I started feeling disgusted about it. I deleted the posts and then the accounts, because I knew the reason I did what I did came from a place of pain and self hate. If I gave you my old usernames you might be able to find the pictures on archive websites. I can't, but a redditor I gave that info to was able to find it. I hate that my pictures are on the internet forever. I hate that I hurt myself and exposed myself like that all because I couldn't feel loved. I'm spiraling in a cycle of self flagellation.

Tl;dr: posted nudes online for social approval and now I regret it.",3,12,tifu

So this evening I was making the infamous spicy, vodka pasta everyone is raving about on Tiktok.
One of the main ingredients is chilli flakes, but because I like spice, I also added some dried bird eye peppers that I crushed in my hands and some greek pepper flakes, again using my hands.

Mistake n.1, a couple of hours go by and I start rubbing my eyes. Enter PAIN. Cried a lot, but everything turned out ok until an hour ago.

I have a shower and go to bed, and as a single, 20y/o girl I decide it would be fun to ‚Äúspoil‚Äù myself.
Enter mistake n.2 a couple of minutes go by and I start burning to an unholy degree. It‚Äôs like Satan himself just fucked me. I feel like Dante‚Äôs Inferno is taking place down there. I could go on with the jokes but got the gist of it, apparently I did not scrub my fingers well enough...

And this finds me now crying in my bathroom, with scrubbed, dehydrated fingertips and  icecubes up my privates and hopping because the tiniest friction is painful...

So I finally got my gf's dad to drive me today and I was so motivated to do it. It was already evening and my gf drove with her dad, but she basically lives in my room so she'll come back today. She asked me to wait another week so she can help me, I just said Yes. As she was gone, I started preparing with sawing and drilling the holes. I was having lots of fun and just kept going, dismantling my furniture and made space in my room. When I had most of my stuff in the living room she came back.

That's were the FU kicked in cuz I said I'll wait for her. We started arguing. I did one year almost nothing to get the woods (called some relatives but never worked out). Now all my furniture is dismantled and all my stuff is disorganized staked in my small room. We always had a mess in my tiny room with 2 people and a dog and now its worse.

t3_kvf2mp,TIFU by sending my mom a photo of my home-cooking.,"Context: my mother and I live 12 hours apart, and don‚Äôt often see each other - but when I was young we would often bond while cooking meals together, a feeling which has lasted through the years. Now, though we‚Äôre far apart, we make a regular habit of sending photos of our respective meals to each other; a kind of hyper-specific love language.

Okay, now for the fuck up. 

Last night, I went out and purchased two big-as-your-head ribeyes from the local grocery. My partner and I spent a while last night making an unnecessarily elaborate dinner to stave off our mutual feelings of depression in a seemingly ever-spiraling reality. Once we had finished, I was admittedly very excited to eat, so I snapped the photo and sent it very quickly before having a moment of realization: I left the lube on the table. 

Now, to clarify, I don‚Äôt have a dedicated dining table; I‚Äôm poor and live in an apartment. So, I have a small ikea table placed in front of the couch which sees a ton of traffic. At some point, the resident tube of JO Brand Water-Based Cooling Lubricant made its way onto the tabletop next to some prescription meds and the strawberry lemonade. 

This was last night, and my mother has yet to respond. It‚Äôs unclear whether or not it‚Äôs obvious enough to be noticed - so I can only foresee one of three things happening: 

A) she doesn‚Äôt notice, and that‚Äôs the end of it.
B) she doesn‚Äôt notice, and in true motherly fashion, proudly posts the photo I sent her on all of her social media accounts.
C) she does notice, and gives me a hard time about it later.

All things considered, could be worse. Though I‚Äôm not very acquainted with shame, and I don‚Äôt wish to be.

t3_kvesqs,TIFU by ignoring the symptoms of COVID-19,"To set the stage, I live with my wife and several of her relatives, including her 80 year old mother who is bedridden. My wife has been absolutely adamant that we take every precaution and then some to avoid getting infected, for two reasons: first, the virus would be a death sentence for her mom, and second, my wife's brother actually did die of it last July.

So, a few weeks ago my brother in law (a different one from the one who died, of course) invites his friend over to help clean up some plants in the back yard. I don't really see much of them during that time but they both appear to be wearing masks. No problem, right?

Well, a few days later this friend tells my brother in law that he tested positive for COVID-19. Everyone is concerned but we let it go because they were wearing masks.

Around the same time, I start feeling really weak and have trouble getting up and down the stairs. Oh, I guess I've gained some weight recently. My wife thinks I should see my doctor, but I tell her it's pointless because the doctor will just tell me to lose the weight.

That was where I fucked up. Because not too long after, my brother in law starts vomiting and having diarrhea. By this time I've completely forgotten about his friend testing positive. Then I get the same symptoms (in addition to the weakness), and then my wife does.

Just today I realize what I've done. I've effectively signed my mother in law's death warrant. If I'd gone to the doctor, I could have been tested and quarantined, and then everyone else could have been tested and quarantined as needed.

Now my mother in law doesn't have any symptoms yet, but I know it's only a matter of time. And I'm afraid to tell my wife the truth, because that would cause her to spiral into the deepest depression imaginable. She's really close to her mom. Then if she kills herself, I'll have to kill myself too, and if she doesn't, she'll be so angry with me that I'll have to kill myself anyway... So I guess I'm keeping this secret as long as possible!

tl;dr didn't consider the possibility that muscle weakness could be a symptom of covid-19 instead of of weight gain, may have allowed my entire family to get infected and signed my 80 year old bedridden mother in law's death warrant",0,14,tifu
t3_kvecp1,TIFU by giving one of my twins laxtives.,"This happened yesterday. My twins are 3 year old fraternal girls that recently graduated to using the downstairs powder room to go potty instead of the dump cups. Twin A has no issue with number 1 or number 2 but Twin B is a different story. Twin B is a clencher. She holds her poop. I have a total of 4 kids and she is the only one to ever do this. Her pediatrician reccomended Pedia-lax (stool softener for kids) make the job easier when the time came. So 2 days of OTC Pedia-lax and still no poop. 

Then comes day 3. Everything is normal and on schedule. Nothing out of the ordinary. Potty time comes and Twin A is in and out in about 5 minutes. Twin B's turn. She seemed tense. Like more tense than usual. She holds the potty seat on the toilet and locks her knees together. She's clenching. So to help the process, I hold her legs up so she has no way of clenching. She's getting upset and angry. I try to tell her to just let it go. 

Then I smell it. I pick her up and there it is. The largest poo I have ever seen in my entire life. I was shook. I clean Twin B up and get her settled in the playroom. Then make my way back to the impossibly gargantuan poo my little princess dropped off. I didn't know what to do. If I flushed it the toilet would definitely clog. I took a picture of it and sent it to my husband asking what I should do. He's an OTR truck driver and usually misses out on adventures like this. He calls me immediately laughing, joking that the poo looks like it's the size of Twin B's arm. He's not wrong. Then he tells me to break it up with the plunger. Well, that's not gonna work because not only is it long and poking out of the toilet water like a choco crocodile but it also has some girth to it. I'm freaking out at this moment because I know what I have to do. I grab an old steak knife that no one loves and attempt to cut the poo log into smaller ""poolettes"". 

It's like clay. The smell is horrid. I start dry heaving. My 2 sons and husband are all laughing hysterically. This is hell. I'm in hell. I get it down to about 4 slices and toss the newly dubbed ""poop knife"" in the trash. Then, with plunger in hand, I flush. It went down no problem and now I am 100% invested in helping Twin B have a regular poo schedule.

I am traumatized.
Never again.

TL;DR:

To avoid clogging a toilet I chopped a record breaking log of poo (courtesy of my 3 yr old daughter) in to 4 pieces with a steak knife. Which I quickly found out was my worse nightmare.

He decided he was Muhammad Ali and started dancing around me with his fists up and taking swings, I told him that wasn't a good idea but then he landed two on me, I didn't think they were much (they actually were quite successful) I was really pissed off now. I grabbed him threw him on the ground and got him in a choke hold.

By December I had 10 over-due assignments, I got most of them done but wanted a beak, so I took a day off. Because I was doing the work quickly, my grades took a tole. Once the end of December rolled around I noticed that the assignments were closing, meaning that I couldn't retry or even view them anymore, but it did mean they were no longer overdue. I thought having closed assignments left undone wouldn't lower my grades even further, I was wrong. I'm only half way though the year and already failed.

t3_kvafqy,TIFU by making my coworkers think I was an very efficient racist,"This happened about 6 weeks ago while I was cashiering at the retail giant I work at. For a little bit of context, one of the many things we sell at this store is bags of ice. However, the ice freezer is located past the checkout lanes, towards the exit, so if someone wants a bag they usually ask if they can grab it on their way out.

Unfortunately, no, because I need to scan the barcode on the bottom of the bag, and the code cheat sheet that we have next to every register doesn‚Äôt have the barcode number for ice.

Now, normally I would just go and grab the bag myself, especially if it‚Äôs an older person or someone with a bunch of kids. However, because of our new covid measures, the lanes all have sliding plastic doors that the cashiers have to move every time they need to get in or out. They are pretty janky, and I‚Äôve pulled them off the track a few times on accident, plus if there‚Äôs a customer in the lane behind me, it makes my squeeze in/out even tighter.

That means I usually just ask the customers to get the ice and bring it back over to the lane so I can scan it. Because of this, I‚Äôve had a lot of exasperated sighs from tired moms and the like, who have to squeeze past their carts to go pull a 25 pound bag of ice out, without having the rest fall on them, etc. In short, buying a bag of ice is a hassle.

Anyway, I got fed up and decided to spend the last 10 minutes of my shift posting the barcode number for the ice bags next to registers so that we would no longer have to scan them to ring them up. As I said earlier, it‚Äôs missing from the cheat sheets we already have for things like produce, so I figured I would write it on pieces of receipt paper and tape it under the existing cheat sheets. After  taping each one up next to a register, I clocked out and left.

The next day I got called into HR, and was told that several of my Latinx coworkers had said I made them feel unsafe. Why? Because I had posted a 10 digit number and the word ‚ÄúICE‚Äù to every register, and naturally they thought it was the phone number for the immigration police.

Luckily, it was pretty easy to explain, and could be verified by the fact that the same number was indeed on the bags of ice we sell, but I definitely got some funny looks from my coworkers for a little while after.

They would cook and style all of the food that we needed for the shots. After it was done and we were resetting the table I would sometimes see the food artists eating what they were done with.

Working in film often consists of long days, and even though we‚Äôre provided food there isn‚Äôt always a moment where you can grab a snack. So toward the end of the day I was HUNGRY.

I thought about it for the rest of the day, but the moment has passed. As someone famous said, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

t3_kv8nju,TIFU My Sleeping Pillow,"TL;DR Recently Ive been having this sleeping pillow that gives me comfort and a sweet nice scent. I like to think it‚Äôs my waifu. I recommend you read the entire thing. But recently the scent has disappeared, just wanted to know why it‚Äôs gone or if I need to clean it. Idk.

I know by the title of this post it sounds kind of stupid and probably no one is going to answer this one but here I go. So for the past 3 months I‚Äôve had this squishy pillow. (Cringe warning) It‚Äôs my sleeping pillow. I like to hug it at night. So and and so on. Recently I‚Äôve been watching anime a lot and like to think it‚Äôs my waifu. It‚Äôs pretty sad. I love the scent of the pillow and it reminds me of nap time and such. The scent is really special to me but recently the scents been gone. I can barely smell it. It just smells like nothing. Nothing at all whatsoever. I sound sick but I want the scent back because it helps me sleep at  night and it calms me down. I don‚Äôt know which sub re-edit is the best for this question besides this one. I just want it back. Anyone have solutions?",1,11,tifu
t3_kv8hhk,Tifu by drawing a penis in my class,"I teach high school physics and we were discussing pulleys. I had a demo going with the entire class huddled in the front observing the setup. I went to the board to show them the forces acting and drew a quick figure and went back to the demo. While I was explaining a lot of the kids started snickering and I turned back to look at the board, it dawned to upon me what I had drawn, a pulley, 2 ropes over the pulley going down on either side with two balls hanging at both ends. I tried to ignore it thinking it will pass,  but that was so stupid of me. The snickering and laughing spread and finally a guy pulled out his phone to take a pic, that was it, I had to acknowledge the faux pas - I took his phone, deleted the pic, cleared the board, thankfully I have a good class we all laughed about it and got back to work.

TL;DR - I accidentally drew a picture in my class which looked like a penis.",30,10,tifu
t3_kv8787,TIFU by thinking my fianc√© and I were home alone,"TL;DR: my fianc√© and I thought we were home alone, but his mom heard us complaining about the dirty dishes his family leaves, and heard her son talk dirty to me. 

This just happened. 

Some important info, my fianc√© (26) and I (24) are living with his family while our house is being built just down the road. With him and I there, the house is holding 5 people and 2 dogs, but it's a rather spacious house. 

When I was doing the dishes, I exclaimed to my fianc√© that his parents were gone after I noticed the lights in the fireplace room were out (which always means they're gone). This prompted my fianc√© to try to woo me by complimenting my body, and other things that couples say and do when they're alone. However, soon enough I get overwhelmed by the amount of dishes because of the pileup (if I don't do the dishes they sit for days). I said to my fianc√©, rather loudly, ""what am I going to do with all these dishes? As I hold up a jar with an egg yolk in it that's been sitting out for two days. 

Then he comes up to me and whispers, ""my mom has been in the fireplace room this whole time"". We quietly return to our bedroom in embarrassment. 

I hope I didn't hurt her feelings by talking about all the dirty dishes, but I think I'm more concerned with what she heard her son say to me, or how many booty slaps she heard.",7,3,tifu
t3_kv80vh,TIFU by stealing from parents credit cards for games.,"This happened today: So there's this mobile game called Call Of Duty Mobile, and there's a lot of cool gun skins and player skin, thing is I have my parents credit cards in my phone and I used them without asking, however, I was planning to get the banks notices from all the monthly purchases that they did so they wouldn't know and punish me. My dad found out that there were a lot of Google Play purchases, he asked if it was me who did this, I say no and he believed me.
However, this morning my mom beat me getting to the mailbox, and she is very protective about money, and when she opened it she took 2 minutes, and she immediately knew it was me because I am the only one who uses Google products, she yelled at me for 20 minutes and almost cried telling me about how disappoint she is at me for stealing, she trusts me a lot so I almost cried, she told me she was going to tell my dad and my brother, if my mom tell him, I'll be beaten up probably. The bad part is that I did a lot of purchases with 5 or 1 dollar charges, which makes it seems I wasted a lot of money. 

Be on the lookout if my dad for a part two and my possible punishment.

I always kept up with rotations and replaced tires. So here it is 5 years later and I've been driving the same stretch of freeway with no problems. As I'm driving at 5 am to work I hear the sound that a large lifted truck with mud tires makes as it passes you. I look over and no truck. Realize its me making the sound. Pull over, inspect, curse. Call co worker and he is already close to work so no luck getting a ride from him. Call my wife and tell her to pick me up with the truck as I have a jack, jack stand, tire iron in it. Everything I should have in this car that I drive 95 miles a day in, I know I'm stupid.. so she pulled up I pulled the tire off my car, put it in the back of the truck and she takes me to work. I get a ride home from the coworker but as we are passing my car on the opposite side of the freeway we see a CHP writing a ticket at my car. I think ok they just found it I have time! Within 1.5 hrs I'm back to the spot the car was parked on the side of the road with a new tire. Car is GONE. Here's my fuck up. I thought I had 72 hrs or 24 hrs to move my car off the road. Call CHP and it's been towed. Call tow company and they want 185 for the tow and 90 to ""open the gates"".$ 275 and that's what I made at work for the day.

t3_kv7jy6,TIFU by thinking it was a good idea to make my own edibles.,"So this happened a lil while ago but popped into my head so thought I'd share. We all need a laugh. 

So me and my husband like to have the occasional 'cheeky smoke' of weed. No big deal. 
We vape it, and over a year, we had about a jar of used bud and thought it would be a great idea to make our own cannabutter and in turn, have a weekend with our own brownie edibles .. 

Sweet baby Jesus and all the orphans of Nazareth, I didn't for one second think it would be as strong as it was. 

So we made brownies with this cannabutter and have a chunk of brownie each, not huge, just an average small sized brownie portion. 

Felt ok at first .. then the high kept building and building until it suddenly felt like everything was spinning in hyperspace and I needed a lie down. Just as I was feeling this, my husband looked to me and was like, 'has it suddenly hit you hard as well?!' 

Cut to the feeling of the devil trying to rip my heart out through my kneecaps. 

My husband goes upstairs and starts throwing up. I go and sit outside thinking it's only a matter of time. 
Outside there was a small bin that had been cleaned and left out to dry earlier in the day so I cling onto it for dear life and went back inside, where I fell to the floor, at the bottom of the stairs, puking hard into this bin. Constantly reminding myself that no one has ever does of a weed overdose. 

We were watching Brooklyn99 before and the TV was still playing. I vividly remember throwing up to the sounds of Terry Crews and my cats walking past which I saw through a fish eye lens. 

I then hear my husband pass out on the floor upstairs and, not being able to move, all I can think of is the police report about how I didn't save him from choking on his own vomit while I was only at the bottom of the stairs. 

I then passed out with my head in the bin of spew. Woken by my head swaying knocking my glasses against the side of the bin. 

Eventually got myself upstairs where my husband banned me from taking my puke filled bin to bed. Good shout tbf. 

Spent the next few days feeling groggy as shit. 
Put the brownies in the freezer labelled 'devil brownie' - just the thought of brownies and weed makes me want to throw up all over again. 

Take my warning kids, don't make your own edibles! D;

t3_kv7jet,TIFU when my girlfriend threw up on my dick (after eating Pizza),"This happened a couple of night ago now. Me and my girlfriend thought it would be a good idea to get a little freaky with each other. 

I thought, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait for this‚Äù she got into doggy and everything was going well. 

We continued to have oral sex and it was the best time of my life. Everything so far so good. As she starts sucking me off she keeps choking but I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. Sometimes that does happen. 

She messed around and said ‚Äúugh, the pizza is coming up‚Äù we laughed and carried on what we was doing. Going to all different types of positions and I was once again loving it. 

She kept chocking on my dick, and we stop for a minute. 

Everything was all good and well so we carried on. She asked me to move positions so she could lay on her back, kind of like a reverse 69 and I was all up for that. 

She starts sucking away, and is it goes deeper all I hear is a mumble from down below and a tap on my leg a couple of times. 

I get up to see what the matter is and all I see is sick just come out of her mouth, some of it in my pubes and on my private‚Äôs. Not a lot I may add. 

She just says ‚Äúoh no! I‚Äôve just threw up on your dick‚Äù next minute she has a mouth full of sick her hand covering her mouth and sprinting to the bathroom. 

In the meantime I‚Äôm just sat on the bed staring at my dick and pubes thinking ‚Äúwhat do I do now‚Äù wondering why does my dick have to be like this. I‚Äôm not saying my private‚Äôs are massive but average size. I felt like giving it a slap like Simon does in the Inbetweeners. Luckily I didn‚Äôt though because that would make for another embarrassing story. 

Safe to say we all cleaned up, carried on and the night had a happy ending.

t3_kv6xbr,"TIFU: I searched something on my phone I DID NOT want my wife to see. Forgot to delete it and she saw it on my recent search history while on my phone, because I told her to look something up.","Alright, obligatory this happened yesterday, not today.

My wife and I are both very young and have developed some issues within our marriage. We are going to marriage counselling and things have been going extremely well as of late. I've realized I have a lot of insecurities and many many more issues I need to work on to become a better husband for her. This is where the major fuck up comes in.

My wife is extremely goofy and it used to sometimes annoy me when she was goofy when the situation was serious. When we got married this is something I loved about her. She always made me laugh and smile, but something changed and I started to get more annoyed by certain goofy things she did. A couple days ago we were at her in laws and she was in one of her goofy moods. She pantsed (Idk how to spell that but she pulled down my pants) me in the kitchen and I got really mad. This is something she always does to her dad and her brother so it is normal but it just struck a cord within me. I yelled at her to never do that again and was quite pissed.

Right after I yelled at her I realized how wrong I was for doing that. I apologized to her right away but I did not feel like that was enough. I realized that something was wrong if I reacted to her that way when I should love her goofy side and just being herself. This made me start to think on why I no longer loved that side of her all the time and I needed to love that side of her to be a better husband for her. We have been going to marriage counselling to fix our problems and the major thing we are working on is ourselves and how we react to one another.

The ***fuck up*** is what happened yesterday in light of me trying to figure out why I was feeling the way I was feeling.

Yesterday morning I was searching on my phone ""Why does my wife's goofy side annoy me"" and ""How do I love my wife's goofy side"". It's something I knew was wrong and was just trying to figure out how to fix it. I would never tell my wife about this feeling since I know that is a huge part of her, and she used to be in an emotionally abusive relationship with a guy who always tried to change her. The problem is...I forgot to delete it from my phone's ""recent searches"" search history.

Later on in the morning we were driving to a new church we were visiting and I asked her to look it up on my phone. BAM! You done fucked up buddy. She goes into my phone to search it and she sees my recent search history. I didn't even realize until after church, but she was being all quiet so I eventually pry it out of her that she saw those recent searches. She tells me it shocked her because she thought we were doing better than usual (which we have been) and that now she feels like she should stop being goofy so she stops annoying me. She even searched up how to not annoy your husband. 

She was really hurt because she always felt like she could just be herself around me and now she feels like she can't. She feels like she can't be goofy around me anymore and really doesn't want to do anything to annoy me. This is what she felt like in her previous relationship and it made her very insecure as a person. I realized just how big of a fuck up this was. I love her goofy side. I realized I was annoyed at her because of insecurities within me not anything to do with her. I told her that and a lot more but I don't think she believes me. She really feels like she can't be herself anymore and is scared to do something goofy to annoy me. 

I feel like a horrible person and really wished I just deleted that search from my search history. I don't want her to change as a person and I feel like all the progress we have been making just went down the drain. I sure did fuck up guys and gals!

TL;DR: My wife and I have been going to marriage counselling to help us with certain things. I reacted poorly to a goofy moment my wife had and felt bad about it. I searched ""Why does my wife's goofy side annoy me"" and ""How do I love my wife's goofy side"" on my phone. My wife saw that in my search history and now feels like she can't be herself around me so that she does not annoy me. I don't want to change her as a person and wish I could have just deleted that search.",45,25,tifu

My  girlfriend is staying with me this weekend and yesterday, we woke up  making \~the eyes\~ at each other, and it wasn't long before we were going  at it. She loves getting creampied, and I love watching it come out.  So, to save needing to do the sheets, we put a towel under her.

Afterwards,  the towel gets thrown in the hamper and we get to the cuddling. After  that, it's time for breakfast. We both go out to the kitchen. She's  drinking coffee while I'm making pancakes.

After  a few minutes, my roommate's dog goes into my room. I don't really  think about this, because he goes where he wants. In true dog fashion,  it's his house and we just happen to live in it.

I go to get my phone from my room, and I see my roommate's dog's head in my hamper, licking the saltiness from the towel.

t3_kv5zou,TIFU by being really hungry and almost being shot by the police,"This happened in my 30's, so I have no excuse other than stupidity.  I was a single guy living alone and hitting the gym hard every night after my 9-5 job,  spending 3+ hours getting in great shape after a bad breakup.  I made a ritual of getting a big tuna &amp; veggies sub from Subway each evening, then watching TV while scarfing it down. 

One night, I had done a really hard workout and was exceptionally hungry, so I rewarded myself by getting a big steak bomb sub on the way home instead of the healthier option.  The smell was driving me crazy, so I went a little faster than usual down a long, dark side street toward my condo.  Suddenly, I saw blue lights in my rear view and got pulled over.  Shit, shit...speeding - this sucks.  The officer came to my window, and seemed nice enough.  He asked, is there any reason you should have been going that fast? (50 or so in a 35 mph zone)  I said no.  He went back to write my ticket.

Now that big steak bomb sub in the seat next to me was smelling so damn good, and it suddenly occurred to my calorie-deficient brain that THIS WAS MY GOOD REASON TO SPEED, and HE WOULD UNDERSTAND!  

So I grabbed the foiled-wrapped sub, and got out of the car.  If I could get him to smell that heavenly smell, and explain, all would be forgiven!

That's when I heard him say with an amplified voice, ""Get back in the car!""  Now my brain was still really befuddled by my hard workout and hunger, and I let momentum take me a few steps closer to his squad car before stopping.  Try picturing this - I didn't do what he told me to do, was still heading toward him, and had something glinting in the darkness in my hand.

I suddenly saw him lean out of his squad car, point his gun right at me, and yell, ""STOP!""  Oh hell yes, I stopped.

He approached me, still ready to shoot me at the same time I said, ""It's a sub I really need to eat - that's why I was going too fast!  I wanted to let you smell it, it's driving me crazy!""

He looked at me in amazement, and said in a shaky voice, ""Do you know how close I just came to shooting you?""  (By the way, I'm Caucasian - if I wasn't I'm not sure if I'd still be alive.)  I then realized the true extent of my fuckup, and the ticket didn't seem like the worst part of my day.

(Yes, I enjoyed that damn sub just about 10 minutes later.)

TIFU by not locking my door

So not today but the other day my husband and I were just out of the shower and started to get a little frisky. While we were getting hot and heavy I looked over to our door to make sure it was locked and it was. At least I thought it was. But the problem is my husband changed the door handle a month ago and now it sits in what looks like the lock position. Well needless to say after we were on the bed and I was riding away about to climax, my oldest son comes barging in to tell us about his win he got on his game.... causing both my husband and I to yell out close the door!

t3_kv5f76,TIFU badly by waking up late.,"Generally I never post on reddit, but today I have to. That too in this subreddit. Allow me to vent out. 

So I work in one big multinational company which focuses on client service. Yesterday night at 1:02AM, manager informed on group of sudden roster change and I was in the new roster. That time I was awake and I accepted the roster. I had to report to office by morning 8AM. 

Then a very nice sleep followed by and I woke up directly at 10AM and after waking up I was wondering something is fucked up and then I remembered I had to go office. Checked my phone and there were 50+ missed calls, messages and what not. I did not say anything and went to office by 11:30AM. 

Welcomed very nicely by my team by calling lazy ass and manager called me in his cabin and he gave piece of his mind. I said sorry and promised this will not happen again. But it was too late because manager called another staff because of my unexpected absense. 

Now I am sitting at home for 1 week and that too without pay just because I woke up late. I am not included in this week‚Äôs roster till saturday and on top of that, no pay. 

Man. Sleep really fucked me up. Can‚Äôt help. I feel very very guilty for my mistake and I haven‚Äôt been able to smile in front of my team and at home, my parents.  This really sucks.

t3_kv5cyw,TIFU by drunkenly thinking a dog would adhere to a human rule,"So this happened a couple months  ago,  I had kind of forgotten abt it until my girlfriend was asking me questions abt the scar on my leg. 

So I started bjj training recently which involves grappling your opponent until you have an advantage to choke or contort their bodies, forcing them to give up and ‚Äútap out‚Äù. This is very standard procedure and take a little bit to get used to. But after a couple months you learn to tap out the second you feel any type of pain you shouldn‚Äôt.  

Fast forward a little bit and it‚Äôs Halloween. 
I get invited to a party by a friend (let‚Äôs call him Adam)and I show up around 9 pm. Everything is going great, I meet this nice girl and we‚Äôre chatting before she asks me for a smoke. I happily obliged and we headed to the backyard.

As I was closing the sliding door I saw a flash of movement in it‚Äôs reflection and wheeled around to find myself face to face with the biggest dog I‚Äôve ever seen in my entire god damn life. Had to be part Rottweiler, Part Pit Pitbull, and part Sabertooth Tiger. It easily weighed 200 lbs and was wrapped in muscle like it ate bricks and steroids for breakfast. Naturally the girl I was with started petting him and calling that murder machine a ‚Äúgood boy‚Äù. I kept my distance while trying to inhale my cigarette in one breath so I could get away from that beast.

I feel like now is a good time to mention this was a COSTUME party. I was in a full kangaroo onesie with the tail and pouch and everything while my female companion went for more of a ‚Äúdeath metal drummer x lifeguard‚Äù type deal going on. 

This is where my true fuck up began. About halfway through my dart our lovely canine companion discovers I have a tail and furiously begins to chomp on it like a chew toy. I pulled it away from her and held it in between my thighs, hoping it wouldn‚Äôt be able to see it and it‚Äôd fuck off after a second. No such luck I‚Äôm afraid. 

This locomotive of an animal shoved her head in between my legs with so much force my legs buckled. She immediately saw the tail as I dropped to one knee and chomped down on it, as well as clamping down on the inside of my left leg at the same time.  Now I‚Äôve been around dogs my whole life so I know what a dog bite feels like. THIS. Was not ANYTHING like that. The pain was so immense and sudden I immediately tapped on the ground. Only to realize, she did not give a fuck about me tapping. By this point I could see some blood soaking through my onesie and was in full blown panic mode. But right as I started having visions of leg amputees I hear the sliding door slam open and what sounded like god himself coming to save me, my friend managed to get her off of me and drove to the ER for a handful of stitches.

t3_kv4qmp,TIFU by mixing up the names of two indian co-workers who are 20 years apart.,"TL;DR: I have 3 indian co-workers, and I referred to one by the name of the other in front of everyone on a Zoom call.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like such a typical ignorant white coworker right now.

I have three indian coworkers at my office.

Bob - 40 year old guy

John - 25 year old guy

Daniel - 25 year old guy

So, on a team meeting Zoom call which included John, Daniel and a few other members of the team, I was telling Daniel about how Bob was working on some files for me.

In the process of doing this, I had referred to Bob as John, and obviously they are distinctly different due to their big age gap alone. Nevertheless, I ended up being \*that\* guy who can't tell POC apart at the office, and I did it on a team meeting Zoom call.

I am a year in working here, and Bob and John (who's names I mixed up) are both the two most recent people I have begun to work with, so I think that is partly why I mixed up the names.

I also happened to have my eyes reading over John's name when I was talking about Bob, so I think I just had that extra influence to make the mix up.

The worst part is that there was already a guy notorious for making this mistake with Daniel and another Indian guy from a separate department, and he was always chided for it behind his back. Welp looks like now thats me.

When it happened, Daniel had begun to hint at my mistake and I quickly and kind of casually corrected myself and continued on to try to not make a big deal about it, but I still know it was noticed.

I'm not sure if I should text John and apologize for the mix up that he witnessed in my and Daniel's conversation.

I'm an effing dumb bi***.
I feel so much guilt and anxiety i am having panic attacks non stop for hours.

So this happened today. (Fyi I am living with my parents,  so its a family dog). My mother was on a walk with a friend of hers and the dog. I was home alone and watching tv,  when I got up and looked out the window (because it was snowing), then I discovered chewed up bits on the floor with my bag next to it. 
So the chewed up things are not an unfamiliar sight, as my dog is chewing up almost regular something in the house (but not eating anything, just for the sake of destroying it).
But the bag was a new sight, I was standing there thinking what had happened (only for a minute or so), when I realized that I left a package of dark chocolate in my bag a week ago. I was panicking, calling my mother immediatley to tell her what happened and to take the dog to the vet asap.
I was in too much shock to cry then, but I did afterwards. Its just a tiny 12 kg dog, that ate about 40 to 50g of 70% chocolate! 
So I had panic attack after panic attack waiting for my mother to call and update me. I'm cursing myself how dumb I am for leaving the chocolate in reach of my dog. I love this dog more than anything, I dont know what I would/ should do if she... I cant write it.

So the dog got something to throw up, but no chocolate... She (the dog) is in the care of the vet, she got an Infusion. We are waiting now for an update from the vet. 

I inspected the bag, and its still zipped up, so technically the dog couldnt reach the inside of it, but she ripped the little side bag and teared the fabric inside open to get to the contents. Some of the stuff inside was beside the bag, so I think she digged inside the bag to take the chocolate...

I never felt so guilty in my life, or so anxious.

If I am violating any rules, please delete this post, I am just writing to distract myself until the vet calls.

Tl;dr: my dog ate chocolate by tearing up my bag, now she is at the vet and I am having panic attacks because of it.

Update: we called the vet, she seems fine and we can pick her up. Im so relieved. Thanks for your kind words!",5,20,tifu
t3_kv3p0o,TIFU: The Peanut Butter Incident,"Obligatory this happened around 11 years ago, around the time my wife (lets call her Wifey) and I had been dating for 1 month.  We are a blended family, which amounts to myself have 3 from previous, she has 3 from previous that I adopted, and we now have twins together.  At this time of the story though, there were no twins.  

Wifey's sister and said sister's kids were visiting, and I was visiting with my 3 kids. We planned to have a nice kid get together to hang out, have fun, eat some food, and have a sleep over.  This amounted to 14 people (3 adults and 11 kids, aged 2 to 12) hanging out in a small single-wide trailer.  The night started out normal. All the kids were playing while us adults hung out and talked.  Kids running back and forth across the house was nothing new to any of us, and the kids were happy to have others to play with.  We decided to make a nice quick ""kid"" dinner, and cooked a proverbial shit ton of Totino's Pizza Rolls.  The kids were excited for them and with that many small mouths to feed it was a nice quick meal.  We all chomped them down to where there wasn't a crumb to be seen, and everyone was full and content.  After Dinner, we all sat down and watched a movie, then sent the kids to bed.  Shortly thereafter, the adults went to get some shut-eye.

Screaming and Crying!  I woke up to the sound of what could only be described as people's souls being ripped out of their very bodies. As a parent, waking up to a kid crying is nothing new, but this was on a whole different level.  It almost sounded like the house itself was in painful agony. I shot out of bed and tried to locate the origins of the sound, but i was coming from all around me.  I honed in on one of them, and ran into the room they were in.  All the kids in that room were crying and moaning.  I could quickly tell that all the other kids and adults were doing the same thing.  I asked what was wrong, and before any of them could complete the sentence telling me their stomach hurt, they all started projectile vomiting en mass.  The sound of the hurling was also in stereo, because the other kids and adults in the other rooms were also doing it at the exact same time.

Now I want you to think about the most graphic war movie you have seen, but replace blood with vomit, then multiply it by 5.  Kids were laying on the bottom bunk, their vomit hitting the underside of the top bunk. Kids were spraying vomit across the walls.  Rivers of it was flowing from the bed onto the floor. A few kids in other rooms thought they could make it to the bathroom, only to spew themselves empty all along the hallway floor and walls. The other adults were vomiting with a mindful approach, but it was still uncontrollable.  The whole house reverberated the sounds of retching, pain, and horror of what they were doing.  This felt to go on for hours, but in all honesty, it probably lasted around 25 minutes before everyone's tank was on E.

I had not vomited at all (i have had bad GERD my whole life that leads to vomiting, so I'm pretty good at keeping it down), and Wifey was the second most cognitive, but she cannot handle puke at all, so I spent the next few hours cleaning up as much as I could, scrubbing walls, removing bed linen, scrubbing mattresses, and soaking/cleaning up the literal rivers of puke going throughout the house.  The worst part about it though, is for some awful reason, it all smelled like peanut butter!

TL;DR - Some bad pizza rolls caused the worst mass case of food poisoning I have ever seen, amounting to a trailer filled with 14 people all puking their guts out at once.",21,6,tifu

So a girl in my team passes a high ball to me and i tried to catch the ball with my hockeystick. Well the ball bounced off my stick and directly bounced against my front teeth and they broke down into small pieces. I immediately went to the dentist but my teeth were so broken they couldn‚Äôt be restored so here I am now with 3 fake teeth because I thought it was a good idea to play without any protection.

I used to work in a pub where there were two sections. The lower section of the pub was for adults only, to drink and eat without the annoyance of children running around and making a ruckus. The upper section was for families with children.

One night it's quite busy and I'm doing my walk around the pub collecting empty glasses. I'm in the lower section of the pub and I spot a blonde woman sitting with what looked like a 5-6 year old blonde girl (her back was facing me so I couldn't see her face). Now normally I wouldn't have said anything but been as the general manager was on shift I didn't really have a choice. So I go over and speak to the blonde woman. ""Hello, I am so sorry but children are not permitted in this area of the pub, we have seating in the upper section...""

The little girl turned around to face me. My heart stopped. I started sweating profusely and I must have gone as red as a tomato. It turned out that the ""little girl"" was actually a little person. She must have been about 30 years old. I completely froze as she just started at me with a face of disgust, understandably. After what seemed like a year of my life, but was probably only about 3 seconds. I apologised and offered her a complimentary beverage. She declined. I apologised again and walked into the glass room. I sat down in the floor, put my face in my hands and prayed for the ground to swallow me up.

I completely lost my balance, causing me to fall face first towards the ground, when falling time seemed to slow down as I realised my face was about to be cushioned by a mound of fresh cow dung.

t3_kv2b3d,TIFU by becoming violently ill while in the middle of doing a tattoo,"Trigger warning for those squeamish about puke , suffer from emetophobia, or are unlucky enough to be eating breakfast when reading this post. 

TL;DR at bottom 

Now, let me put this out there: I am 42 now and have suffered from severe emetophobia for most of my life(for those that don‚Äôt know what it is, it is a severe phobia of vomit, or feeling like you have to, or are consumed with anxiety that someone else will.) Like all phobias, of course, they make no sense, but the absolute terror and panic they can cause can be *terrifying*. 

For many emetophobes, through sheer force of will, we can usually suppress the urge to vomit and I am usually a champion at this. Up until yesterday, it had been over ten years since the last time I vomited and though I am currently dealing with an illness that often makes my stomach flaky as hell, I have medication I can take but, I can usually power through it.

I am also a tattoo artist and I was tattooing one of my regulars when my stomach started to do that thing it does when it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúBitch, you better get to the bathroom *now*!!!‚Äù

So I went into the bathroom, took my mask off, tried to take slow, deep breathes, put cold water on my face. Nope, I couldn‚Äôt even control it and it felt like it would never end. I had to call my coworker into the bathroom because I couldn‚Äôt do anything more than slump again the floor by the toilet.

I explained to my coworker what was going on, that I was going to have to finish this tattoo another time and I was going to have to tell my client what was going on and I wasn‚Äôt going to charge him what I already did cuz I already felt like a huge douchebag because he waited for a few a weeks for this appointment. 

My coworker went into my office and explained and I just about got to the part where I asked my coworker to wrap him up when I had to run back to bathroom and round two began. 

So, I just want to make it known that I‚Äôve been tattooing for 25 years, and I‚Äôm not one of those assholes who runs home at the slightest sniffle. I‚Äôve tattooed while going through cancer, I‚Äôve tattooed with broken bones, I‚Äôve tattooed with stitches holding my hand together, I say all this so it‚Äôs known that I‚Äôm not some light-weight whining about a little tummy ache. 

This was awful and humiliating and then to make it worse, I had to explain to my manager why my client filled out his consent forms but there was no money from it. Today, I‚Äôm going to rest and attempt to eat something. Wish me luck on having a cooperating stomach. 

TL;DR-I was a good hour into doing a tattoo when the wrath of god himself descended on my stomach. Couldn‚Äôt stop puking and was unable to finish my clients tattoo .

t3_kv0uuy,TIFU by not checking my sound setup in a meeting,"This happened about an hour ago

Some background information, our neighbors are currently getting a loft extension

I had to present a presentation with a group over Microsoft teams. I wasn't looking forward to it but it had to be done. In a pre meeting call with my group, I was testing different microphones to see which was the best quality. After finding the best microphone my neighbors decided to start drilling and sawing. because I didn't have the time to go round and ask them to stop, I just sighed. 

My team and I joined the call and started presenting. While we are presenting, when my slides are not up, I am muting my headset to avoid any background noise from the drilling. When my slides come up, I unmute myself and start talking. The drilling gets even louder and annoying. I grit my teeth and carry on. After my slides have finished, I mute my headset once more and say quite loudly ""for fuck sake, fucking hell"".

my friend then sends me a message on snapchat saying ""yo don't swear"". I was very confused as to how she knew I had said anything. I then looked at my laptop. At this point, the penny dropped like an atomic bomb. I had left a microphone plugged in. this meant that whenever I thought I had muted myself, I hadn't.

I nearly ripped the other microphone out of the usb port and quickly changed my settings on teams. the rest of the presentation didn't go too badly however and wasn't marred by my mistake. 

I was just thankful that I fucked up the most out of my group because I am able to laugh about it.

t3_kuz8j2,TIFU by mistaking dried bone broth for beef jerky and pouring it down my gullet.,"My wife and I have recently been trying to find different ways to lose weight. One of those ways involve changing some of our eating habits. About a month ago, she discovered a brand of protein bars that she started using as meal and snack replacements. She offered it to me a few times and I finally caved about two days ago. Instantly was amazed by the flavor and incorporated into my diet as well.

Fast forward to today, and for dinner, we had had a smaller than usual portion of food, and about 2 hours later, I was hit with a craving for more. She was in the wash, so I decided to creep into the pantry and see if we had anymore bars that I could snack on. Saw the bag of bars but then I noticed another pouch by the same company, that was next to the bars and unopened. This unopened pouch of secrets (not see through) caught my eye with a curious wonder. Without actually reading the bag, I glanced at a few images and saw a Cow on it. I knew I had hit the jackpot: This amazing brand who makes protein bars also makes its own beef jerky.

Instantly, I went and opened the pouch with scissors and inside were small, skinny individual packaging. No matter. Nowadays, many beef jerky brands have come out with sticks so I thought nothing of it. Since it was so small, I thought to myself: ‚ÄúHead back and bottoms up‚Äù. Whelp, as the pour began, a mound of powder hit the back of my throat. I had flashbacks to the Cinnamon challenge I did like 10 years ago ü§Æ. I began to cough and was bewildered by this inconsistency with my expectations. While navigating a could of dust and saliva, I grabbed the parent packaging and look underneath the cow to read: dried bone broth. It was like concentrated seasoning within my mouth. The overwhelming flavor was terrible at that volume and due to expectation management, ruined my snacking moment.

After cleaning the mess I had created (literally spitting up this stuff and it was everywhere), I went to shower. My confused wife noticed me as I walked into the bathroom after her and asked why I was covered in powder. I told her what happened and she was in tears. She always gets in me for skimming everything I read and not paying attention and this was a victory for her. For once, I had to just laugh at myself because she was 100% right. Apparently bone broth is becoming popular in the mainstream so a lot of brands are starting to branch out and sell it and the brand who makes the protein bars had it as a promotional sample offer, hence the unique packaging.

TLDR: In a momentary lapse of judgement and increased greed, I attempted to consume a package of concentrated bone broth and made a mess in my home. Not super crazy but definitely leaned to pay more attention.",71,12,tifu

I wasn't doing any homework and I didn't really care that much until the day our teachers mentioned that our grades would be based on homework since they couldn't do exams(they didn't trust online exams and we couldn't go to school because of lockdown). So I was panicking thinking I was gonna get a very low score on all of my classes since I did at best 10 of the hundreds of homework's given this year. So I decided that I should just submit fake homework. Basically I made a program that would find blank spaces in the page and fill them with premade images of calculations and such. then I would just submit those. And it worked for like a couple months

After cleaning him I went online to read some tips for cat lovers. There was one tip for long fur cats about cutting  fur around cats anus. At that time I didn't think that my cat had long fur so I ended up not using that tip. And later I  forgot about it

So this happend 2 hour ago.  Around 8 in the morning I woke up to my cat digging a hole in his litter box. 10 minutes later he was still in his litter box trying to do something. As I was about to turn on the lights he started pooping. Great finally I can sleep again. No... After finishing he started to cover up his mess with litter so he made even more noise. Then it got quite for a second and I heard him scratching floor.  I thought it was weird because he never does that. While I was thinking my sis came into my room and asked if I want rice porridge. I said yes and  then she asked if I want it with sugar or salt. See where this is going? 

I said that I want it with sugar but she didn't heard me. And because I was angry  and sleepy I rised my voice so she could hear me and said SUGAR! My cat who was still scratching floor looked at me and thought he did something bad  got scared and run under my bed. And with him running the smell came. I turn on the lights and I see trail of poop from his litter box going to my bed and around it. At first I thought he was having diarrhea while he was running which I thought was kindda funny. But then I see massive amount of turd around his legs and his anus and then it strucked me that my cat has long fur and I remembered that tip from months ago. I thought I can still use baby wipes to clean him but turns out I didn't have any left

My in-laws invited us on vacation to Hawaii. They paid for almost everything. They were very generous and I‚Äôm very grateful.

However, I‚Äôd been back for a few days and my ear was hurting. By the next day the soreness had greatly increased. It was at this point i knew i had an ear infection. But i also did not have health insurance. I was barely making more than minimum wage and really couldn‚Äôt afford insurance. However, that night i couldn‚Äôt sleep. It hurt far too bad. I googled every ear infection remedy i could and tried everything: hydrogen peroxide, qtips, warm compress, even candling on the off chance the heat would kill the infection. Nothing. I read on the internet that ear infections usually go away after a few days so i decided to tough it out. Even an obscene amount of sleeping pills failed to knock me out in the face of the pain. Finally, after the third straight day of no sleep i go to CVS and pay the steep price of $100 to get a doctor to look at my ear. It‚Äôs an ear infection alright. He gives me some antibiotic ear drops and sends me on my way.

The drops didn‚Äôt work. But i figured for an infection this bad they might take a while to have an effect. My USMC recruiter called and offered me an early ship date. Someone had chickened out and quit. It was Friday and he said he could get me on my way on Monday. My wife said i shouldn‚Äôt take it so we could spend more time together. Ultimately though, i took the early ship date. 

When I got to MEPS, I hadn‚Äôt slept for a week straight, i couldn‚Äôt hear out of the ear, and pus was oozing out. It‚Äôs possible i fell into microsleeps here and there but for the majority of the night i was awake and watching tv on my phone. I learn on arrival to the recruit depot that for the first two days of boot camp they don‚Äôt let you sleep. It was miserable and i was barely functioning.

On the ninth day i failed the heating test. This got me sent to a doctor to examine my ear. He said that my ear was detaching from my head. So he sent me to the naval hospital. They did a variety of tests, including an MRI. I was diagnosed with a severe case of mastoiditis.

Mastoiditis is an infection that starts in the ears, but then makes its way to the base of the head, about where the spine meets the skull. The infection then travels to the skull. When it gets into the skull it‚Äôs almost impossible to root out bc of the skull‚Äôs honeycomb structure. From there it attacks the brain and at this stage is usually fatal since even when treated bits of it would resurface in the skull and attack the brain again. According to the doctor who was explaining all this to me, i was at most days away from the point where death was almost certain.

The hospital prescribed me some pills. However, i was sent to the medical platoon to recover. This set me behind by three weeks. Then COVID struck. If I‚Äôd been with my original platoon i would‚Äôve been able to have a normal USMC boot camp graduation. But because of this delay, i was in one of the first platoon‚Äôs whose graduation was cancelled. They also took away my boot leave. As a result, the anticipated 3 month separation from my wife turned into a 9 month separation as i finished up post boot camp schooling. 

On top of all that, i essentially went 9 days straight without sleep. I‚Äôve since been reading on how severe sleep deprivation might cause permanent brain damage. While the effects aren‚Äôt really known well by science, or if it really causes permanent brain damage, i believe it. While other factors may be at play, since then I‚Äôve developed a stutter, become confused more easily than before, have slower reaction times, much worse short term memory, and have greater trouble focusing on things. Course, that could just be in a stressful job in a new environment not having the time to read like i used to and I‚Äôll catch back up to where i was. I‚Äôm really hoping it‚Äôs the latter

TLDR: swam in the ocean, causing me to be separated from my wife for 9 months and possibly causing permanent brain damage

So my friend from out of town invited me to a family chuch one morning. About 3-5 families and a few singles. Church went as normal. Nothing too special there. We had lunch, then just talked until people felt like they needed to leave. A couple kids who lived in the house was busy coding on Scratch on the public computer. The parents are really carefully on what they can and can't do. No downloads. Can't even use YouTube) So 12 year old (Lets call her K) was trying to convince her younger brother (J, who is 11) that putting your age and school on your scratch profile is a bad idea (which it is), so I show them how to use Grabbify (a free tool to phish for someone's IP address and location). So now the kids are excited, cause they believe that they are hacking and doing cool advanced stuff.¬†

And now for the FU.

He is also 11, and the is messing around with adult content on reddit, thinking he is anonymous, but I found him. His last post (at the time) was literally called ""Porn."" I had a laugh, and showed it to the kids. (NOT THE POST. JUST THE TITLE), expecting them to have a laugh at him too. Nope, they just said it out loud a good 3-4 times. J admitted he didn't know what it meant, and K was still confused about how someone just blurts out his location on the internet.

I have NEVER been able to do this, but I figured today was the day I would.

I rest my arms on the counter and look up at him.

""Hey do you hear that?""

Nothing. I try and try, I KNOW something is leaving the South Pole within the next 10 seconds.

Something did leave the South Pole.

It was NOT a gas like I'd intended. It was... a solid. A SQUISHY SOLID.

My eyes widened. My normal mind knew what I had just done was horrifically embarrassing. My crackhead mind (which was leading at the moment) decided to announce what had happened. It started with a light chuckle that turned into full blown laughter. The final thing I said to my family through laughter before waddling upstairs like a penguin incubating an egg was:

""Well.. I'm gonna take my leave now, seeing as I've gone and shit myself.""

TL;DR: I became VERY hyper after a new dosage of ADHD medication wore off, tried to make my brother laugh by farting on command, but instead just shit myself in the kitchen.

Edit: forgot a few words. Shitting yourself really brings you back to when you were 1.

Edit 2: I brought this up to my mother by saying ""i posted anonymously about 'the incident' last night on reddit"". She goes ""what incident?"" 

""Mom, I SHIT MY PANTS!""

t3_kuwssk,TIFU by drunkenly telling one of my coworkers that another coworker likes him,"I feel terrible about this, but let me set a scene for you. Me and my coworker/friend Z are both 18 m. Another coworker of ours M is 17f. We are all friends at the place I work and are all really close. One night, I was out drinking with some friends and M snapchatted me asking me a question. I couldn't really comprehend what she was saying so I told her that I have been drinking and would answer her question in the morning. She asked me if I would remember anything in the morning and I told her most likely no, as I had a decent amount and planned on having more. She then told me that she likes Z, and asked me to keep it a secret. I said I would. This happened about 2 weeks ago. Today M and I were making plans then she said out of the blue ""did you tell Z that I like him?"" I said not that I can recall, as I never really thought of it after she told me. She said that another coworker of ours, J, talked to her about it, and he said that he over heard Z talking about it to other coworkers. I happened to be working with Z, and it was just him and I, and I asked him if he knew anything about it. Apparently drunk me thought it would be a great idea to tell him. It must have happened after I had more booze in me as I have no recollection of it. I apologized profusely to M, as I felt like I took her trust and my promise and threw them out the window. I met up with her about an hour ago to talk it over and we made up, so everything is fine now, but now that I know I did this makes me feel awful.

t3_kuvrha,TIFU by misplacing my fish oil capsules.,"This all started last weekend when I got up on Saturday and got out my supplements. A couple fish oil capsules and some vitamin d3. I swear I remember setting them down on my night stand, then I went to go get water, and promptly forgot to take them. I remembered not too long after and went to go take them, and they're gone ? Okay. I looked *everywhere*. I could not find them. After 10 mins I started doubting I even got them out in the first place?? Okay whatever. I got out some more. The other ones will turn up, right?

Boy, did they ever. This evening I started my laundry. My first load is done, I transfered it over to the dryer, and when it's finished? I opened my dryer and immediately knew my fuck up, the entire load absolutely reeked like warm fish oil. I just restarted that load in the washer for the 4th time. I added lots of vinegar and borax in addition to laundry soap. I hope it works this time.

t3_kuvnt9,TIFU by talking smack about my date with my mom,"To give some context, I have been seeing this guy I met on a dating app for about 2-3 weeks. Our first few dates were pretty good, but a consistent problem is that this man is ALWAYS working. I'm talking 18-hour workdays, on call on weekends, etc. He's an investment banker in NYC at a relatively new job, so to some extent, I get it.

Our 4th date (where this royal fuckup occurred) almost never happened. He'd spent the previous 3 days committing to plans with me, pushing the time back repeatedly, before eventually canceling because of work. The third time this happened, I was fed up and broke things off. He was repentant and asked for another chance...to which I obliged, because I thought he was a sweet person with good intentions.

Saturday night rolls around and he manages to make it to my apartment. I pour us some wine, and start getting excited about finally spending some time with him. Within about 20 minutes, he suddenly asks if he could use MY computer to send some emails! I was FUMING. This guy breaks promises 3 days in a row, begs for me back, then can't even spend half an hour with me uninterrupted?! I brusquely hand him my computer, pour myself a big ass glass of red wine, and go into my room while he's out working in the living room.

I am very close to my mom, and she knew this boy was on thin ice. I start texting her about how furious and disrespected I feel. My mom is a very, umm... straightforward and blunt woman. She sends some scathing texts saying his boss is taking advantage of him, the job sounds shady, she hopes he's making a ton of money, etc.

At this point he comes in and asks if I have Excel on my computer. I tell him NO (lmao). He leaves, and this is where I realize how royally I have fucked up. My text messages are connected to my computer, and this guy is reading every single one that pops up on the top right of the screen. My heart nearly fell out of my butt and I called my mom, whisper-yelling, ""HE CAN SEE THE TEXTS. DON'T SEND ANY MORE."" I am panicking, but I can't stop laughing because frankly, screw this guy. My mom laughs too. I get a text from my roommate asking if I'm okay, and that makes me laugh even more.

For the rest of the night, I pretended I didn't know about the messages. I wish I could say the date was smooth-sailing after that. Dark secrets were revealed, there were tears from both parties, both of us stormed out on each other at different points, and he told me he thinks I am going to hell (he's religious and I am not).

Somehow, after all this, he ended up staying the night. The next morning I turned to him and said, ""Hey, just so you know, I know you saw all the messages when you were working on my computer. Sorry about that.""

His response: ""What messages?"" ... -\_-

HE HADN'T SEEN THEM. And then I had to explain myself hahahahaaaa kill me

t3_kuvirh,"TIFU by Drinking Way Too Much, Passing Out, and...","This happened about 10 years ago and it‚Äôs taken every single day since to be able to talk about this. 

One night, an ex and I decided to drink together. I‚Äôm not the biggest drinker in the world and don‚Äôt have an amazing tolerance so what you‚Äôd expect to happen, did in fact happen.

One second we were laughing, the room was spinning, everything blurred, and then lights out. 

When I opened my eyes, I noticed we were in bed together. I didn‚Äôt remember going to bed, in fact, I didn‚Äôt remember much at that moment, but it was light out, the birds were chirping, and something felt wet down by my butt area.

‚ÄúOh no‚Ä¶ Did I pee the bed?‚Äù I thought in a mild panic. 

I lifted the sheets and to my absolute horror, I saw that didn‚Äôt pee, but rather, I had explosive diarrhea all over myself and her.

I‚Äôve been through a lot of shit in my life, pardon the pun. Car accidents, near death experiences, brawls, police chases, and many other adrenaline inducing events and nothing, I repeat, nothing I have ever gone through, put me in such a state of panic as that very moment. 

I still remember the needle sensation all over my body as I began to flash sweat. 

I look over and she‚Äôs still sound asleep. Good. I have some time to figure this out. 

When you‚Äôre panicked like that, you start to think of some pretty crazy ideas. One of which was to blame it on her. Since the indent of her body caused a mud slide in her direction, thereby saturating her panties, all I had to do was remove my boxers and throw them out the window. Then, I‚Äôd gently wake her up and say, ‚ÄúBabe, listen, don‚Äôt be alarmed but you pooped all over yourself and me. Don‚Äôt be embarrassed, this stuff happens, and I still love you.‚Äù

I‚Äôd just have to scoop some of my poop into her butt crack to really sell it but, what if she woke up in the process? I think that would be somehow harder to explain. 

My other plan was to pull the sheets out from under her like some sort of lounge magician. I didn‚Äôt think it would work but I‚Äôd be a fool if I didn‚Äôt consider everything. 

Time is ticking and every second that goes by makes me panic more. We‚Äôre breaking up. She will immediately break up with me. I mean, I pooped all over her. Can a relationship really withstand that? Can she ever respect me again? Look me in the eye without thinking of someone else‚Äôs poop all over her butt? Can I think of her sexy round butt cheeks without them being tainted by images of my diarrhea all over them? 

While these, and a thousand other thoughts, race through my head, she wakes up. Her eyes slowly open and she gives me a smile and kisses me good morning. Our last kiss, I assume.

She tells me she had a good night. I was so funny how I passed out and she put me in bed. She doesn‚Äôt notice the mess she‚Äôs laying in. I hold those sheets down with all my might. 

After a few minutes of talking, she decides to get up to go to the bathroom. I tell her to wait.

‚ÄúI have to tell you something.‚Äù

She looks at me concerned like I‚Äôm going to break up with her or something. I guess she could read the seriousness of my face. 

‚ÄúI need you to slide out of bed and go take a shower. Don‚Äôt look at the sheets. Don‚Äôt look at anything, just go in the shower right now.‚Äù

She was always the type of girl who would do the exact opposite of what you told her to do. She ripped the sheets off me, saw me laying in my shame, and started laughing hysterically. 

She laughed for what seemed to be 25 years. She‚Äôs probably still laughing now. 

She told me not to worry, she‚Äôs a nurse and she sees this every day. She smiled and shook her head. 

I balled all the sheets and told her I‚Äôd wash them. Her condo didn‚Äôt have machines so I told her I‚Äôd take them with me. I remember carrying a ball of poop sheets, naked, around her place because I didn‚Äôt know what to do with them. 

She took them from me and said she‚Äôd take care of it, she was used to cleaning poop at the hospital. She never brought it up again and she made me feel real comfortable about it. We didn‚Äôt break up. Then at least. The relationship lasted 4 more years after that but not before her dog licked my butt hole during sex once but that‚Äôs another story for another time. 

I wish that was the only time I got drunk and pooped. The other time, I was with a bunch of my cousins and they told me that I was so drunk that I pulled my pants down and pooped in the corner in front of everyone. Then I went to sleep. They left it there for me to clean up in the morning. 

The crazy thing is, I don‚Äôt know this person. I feel like some sort of werewolf who loses all recollection of a night of ravaging the town except, instead of terrorizing villagers, I‚Äôm shitting on people and things and losing all memory of it.

I‚Äôm terrified of drinking too much now.

And one of her candles went out and had the wax all up on the sides so she was gonna throw it away, but my mom said that if you put an uneven candle  in a pot of boiling water it'll melt back in place.

t3_kuu7x7,TIFU by agonizing over why he won‚Äôt come with me,"TIFU by agonizing over why I will have to solo a mission. It‚Äôs not his fault. I have issues. But sometimes talking about it helps, and since there‚Äôs nobody else to talk to but the Internet, here‚Äôs a howl into the void.

I have to make a time-sensitive trip to Colorado for a family matter. Yesterday I invited my SO of two years to come with me, because we have gone before and it was fine. Today, he said he doesn‚Äôt want to go and said he wants to wait for his relief check to arrive. I just can‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs the reason why he doesn‚Äôt want to go. That‚Äôs the whole fuck up. I‚Äôm mental and hurting.

I‚Äôm older than he is by 13 years. He‚Äôs expressed interest in other women, not that that‚Äôs anything unusual these days. I‚Äôm not exactly cute or ideal and I‚Äôm used to being a proverbial mouse in the corner in person. I‚Äôm telling myself it wouldn‚Äôt matter if he stays and sleeps around because there‚Äôs nothing preventing him from doing that whether I‚Äôm in town or not.

I cried over this like a moron. Even if he didn‚Äôt sleep around, this is time he doesn‚Äôt want to spend with me and I hardly get to see him as it is with the way my work schedule (and present back injury) have screwed our circumstances. That‚Äôs a 40 hour round trip drive, *easily.* It doesn‚Äôt exactly sound exciting to me either, but I feel like I am breaking at the thought of going without him.

I can‚Äôt sleep, but I‚Äôve taken Tylenol PM and melatonin and Zyrtec to help with that. I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself. What if he‚Äôs done with me and he just hasn‚Äôt said it yet? How do people move on for the umpteenth time after building your life around someone with whom you‚Äôd thought a connection existed?

I struggle to do things for and by myself because the self-hatred runs deep. Without him, all the joy is gone from life and there‚Äôs nothing left to look forward to or work toward. He knows how I feel about him and I thought he felt the same... but he would rather stay at his cousin‚Äôs house waiting for a check that might not arrive, playing video games and smoking distillate, than be in my company. I guess I get it. If I had a choice I wouldn‚Äôt be with me either.

She has no kids, her nieces and nephews don‚Äôt talk to her and her step kids literally tricked her into thinking that she owns nothing of her late husbands belonging and took all of their dads belongings. They tried to take more but she stopped talking to them.

My wife and I helped her out a lot, mowing the grass, maintenance around the house, take her to sell at the flea market, dr, etc... without ever asking for payment of any kind. One day she comes up me as I was cutting grass and asked if I want her late husbands truck. 2011 Chevy diesel with 32k miles. I was hesitant and shocked but obliged and said yes. 

She gives me the title and bill of sale and got everything transferred. I have a car that I don‚Äôt use anymore so I decided to sell it today.

t3_kuu25f,TIFU by scratching jalape√±o pepper oil all over my naughty bits.,"Today my wife decided to make stuffed jalape√±os. We‚Äôve never made them ourselves so it was an exciting family experience. She cut them up, I scooped out all the extra stuff inside, and my youngest daughter made sure they were all clean and free of seeds.

All went well. They were a hit at the dinner table and perfectly complemented our gourmet meal of frozen taquitos, chips and melted Kraft cheddar cheese, and store-bought salsa. I know, nothing spectacular but it got the job done.

I rubbed my lips with my hands at one point and noticed that they got VERY tingly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs funny‚Äù, I mused to no one in particular. So I proceeded to wash my hands quickly with a bit of soap and water. That should do it, right? 

Later in the evening, the kids were quietly and happily playing together for once, my wife was baking a wonderfully smelling concoction, and life was just pretty swell. 

And then I got an itch.

No special itch in particular. Just one of those usual itches that a guy can get on the shaft of his penis. I‚Äôve had many in my 39 years of life. Just scratch it and carry on with life. 

Not today. No no, my friends. Today was not to be a usual day for me.

I scratched. It felt good so I gave it a few more scratches. Not to arouse myself, but just because it felt good like a back scratch can feel good. Unbeknownst to me, I was spreading microscopic droplets of satan‚Äôs own saliva-borne pepper oil all over my little friend. I washed my hands as a proper gentleman does and then went about my business.

Time passed (actually it was only about 45 seconds)

It began as a small tingling. The following was my next mistake in a long string of them. Before I knew what was going on, I decided to give Mr. Happy a few extra scratches. He had been a good boi so he needed that extra bit of love. More of Cthulhu‚Äôs cream was scratched in.

Now it REALLY started to hurt. This is when I finally came to the grave realization that my otherwise pleasant day was about to get nightmarishly awful. I yelped something to my wife. In my mind I said ‚ÄúHoney, I‚Äôm heading to the bathroom‚Äù in a manly voice. In actuality, I whimpered some kind of unintelligible gibberish to her before waddling as quickly as possible to the bathroom, pulling my pants down in the process.

Now, I had options. I could take a shower, I could use my newly-installed Christmas present, the bidet. Or I could squat in the bathtub and use the faucet as a life-giving waterfall. I chose the bidet firstly. Since it‚Äôs really only made to squirt the backside and the front for women, I had to turn it on and maneuver my chubby body all around. Water shirted everywhere. It was a mess. A terrible, ineffective mess. Next up was the bathtub. I squatted down in all my nakedness and let the cold water run all over my frank and beans. It felt temporarily better but not great.

Next, I chose the shower. I can tell you with no amount of uncertainty that even lukewarm water on the site of a pepper oil burn on the shaft of a penis feels like the devil has come to take you away, penis first. I screamed. 

I was out of options. No amount of water helped. I was in so much pain but had to find options. The first thing I saw was to use milk or yogurt. We don‚Äôt have yogurt. We do have milk. 

Fine.

I put a towel on. The fibers of the towel felt like they were puncturing my skin. But I had to make it to the fridge. I got a nice big glass of milk. My wife had a wooden spoon halfway into a mixing bowl but she was frozen in place, staring at her husband and wondering if he had finally fallen off the deep end. I waddled back toward the bathroom to the sound of one of my kids asking innocently why I was going to drink milk in the bathroom. 

After I made it back in, I closed the door and dipped my now bright red member fully into the milk. I heard a noise. I looked up. The doorknob was turning. I hadn‚Äôt locked the door. The last thing I wanted was one of my girls walking in and having her first glimpse of a male penis to be from her father dipping it into a glass of milk. 

No. NO!!!!

The doorknob stopped turning. I waddled over, spilling milk everywhere in the process. I would not let this day get any worse.

The next solution was alcohol. It seems counterintuitive, but I was out of options. I rubbed some isopropyl alcohol all over. Then I rubbed some milk. Then water. Rinse and repeat for 30 minutes. Finally things were starting to look up. The burn was subsiding slightly. I didn‚Äôt feel like I needed to cut it off to alleviate the pain. The satanic glory hole that I had found myself in was at an end. 

Afterwards, I took the coldest shower I have ever taken. I stepped out. Naked, shivering, penis looking like it lost a fight with a meat grinder, I was free. I was still in pain but I could see the light at the end of the tunnel. I found my loosest pair of boxers, gingerly put them on, and waddled out to the living room. My whole little family was watching me, half-afraid and half-curious at what misadventure I had gotten myself into this time.

I had to explain to my girls that I scratched my bottom with pepper oil. Close enough. My wife wanted to see the damage. She stifled a giggle and told me she was sorry. She later told me we would laugh about this sometime. In the meantime, no peppers for me.

TL;DR - I had pepper oil in my fingernails and accidentally scratched it into the shaft of my penis. I experienced the Wrath of Satan himself.",150,26,tifu

t3_kut2tw,Tifu by spraying an ABC fire extinguisher at a grease fire.,"Wife overheated a pan of grease on our flat top stove. The pan was completely full, I'm talking a full liter of oil. Caught fire, wife panicked a bit, didn't know what to do. By the time I got to the kitchen, the surrounding area was already lit. Papers on the counter, wife's phone, pot holders nearby, all lit. I thought I couldn't just cover it with a towel (towel on the oven handle was on fire) and it had a splatter screen on it which was also on fire. The kitchen is so small, I literally couldn't get to any of the cabinets to get dry powder like baking soda which we didn't have enough anyway. My instinct was to hit it with the extinguisher, so I did.
 
That's when it got turned up to 11. Huge explosion caused by the pressure of the extinguisher spraying oil everywhere. I decided to just spray everything else besides the pan, and everything else went out quickly. Cabinets, range, papers and other misc stuff on the counter were all out, but the oil pan was still burning strong. I didn't know what else to do.
 
So I popped on some oven mitts, picked up the burning pan, and walked outside with it.  Spilled a bit on the floor on the way out. Spilled a bunch on myself, lit myself on fire. Spilled a lot at the door as I basically threw it outside lol. Then got sprayed with extinguisher. Some how miraculously came out with only a burn on my finger, though it's severe. My face and neck was red, and I got a spicy new hair cut, but no other blisters besides the finger. Wearing multiple layers saved me. My pants halfway burned off but my long underwear were only singed. Same with my shirt and thermals underneath.
 
Obviously 3 mistakes here on my part. 1. Not having a working smoke detector to alert us to fire sooner. 2. Using a pressurized extinguisher on a grease fire (it was effective at putting out the surrounding area, but I shouldn't have pointed it directly at the pan, even if from 6 feet away) 3. I shouldn't have even tried to get it outside. I could have killed myself, and I could have spread the fire further through the house making it harder for firefighters. After the explosion, i was right to extinguish everything else, but once it was out I should have then gone and got a towel or blanket to smother the oil. I don't think that was an option from the start, because of the surrounding fire, but once it was all out I should have done that instead. 
 
I'm lucky to be alive, and lucky it was only the kitchen on fire and the rest of the house just has minor smoke damage. I'm feeling really stupid, even though my wife regards me as a hero. I'm sure if I had of just left it and done nothing, the whole house would have burned down. But I'm wishing I made better choices. 
 
Tl;dr: grease fire + pressurized extinguisher = boom. Don't walk with a burning pan. Smother with lid, baking soda, towel or thick blanket.

Barangays are the smallest administrative district in a Local Gov't Unit, and usually the oldest barangays have houses that are really close to each other, usually either separated by a firewall or just a couple of meters of clearance, in this case it's the latter. This is because the lot we had was divided into two, with a small path in the middle for both houses, neighbors are my relatives that we don't talk to much anymore. Lastly, I have jalousie windows.

I'd wake up at 2-3am with my neighbor talking to someone on the phone and it's obnoxiously loud, aside from that there's his brother that does rants in the middle of the night like some child on a tantrum. It's as if there aren't any people sleeping. This was the case back in March 2020 up to now. 

This morning I had enough, I tried shouting indirectly about letting people sleep and how noisy it was, that
 didn't work, it's like he didn't hear anything. Then my dumbass self banged on one of the glass panes on the window, I didn't expect I'd hit it hard enough for it to break in the middle, with the shards falling to the path in the middle. The pathway was for the inner residences at the back of the lot, I was lucky too that it was early in the morning so there aren't any people passing by. That
 he did notice, and we had an argument. After I cooled off I calmly talked to him again to tell him to tone down when it's night time, he understood (hopefully). Patched up the hole in the window with a cintra board the size of the broken jalousie glass.

Tl;dr: After months of tolerating my angry neighbor I got fed up and broke my window by banging on it because I was trying to get him to shut up.",4,0,tifu
t3_kus0r8,TIFU by leaving my windows cracked at lunch,"Obligatory not today, but in my defense reddit wasn't around when it happened, around 2006.  I worked at a shitty call center that I hated doing tech support for directTV.  I signed up for split shifts after a year because they offered 3 dollars more an hour to do it. I assume because the lunch and dinner hours were the highest call volume.   So one day, I finish my morning shift and go home for lunch on a nice spring/summer day.  We usually let my cat outside around this time because he liked to sun bathe.  He never went far, just lay on porch, lawn,  or driveway.   Well I eat my lunch and take a nap. 


Eventually it's time to go back to work and I leave.  Its about a 7 minute drive because it's a bit out of town.  I park.   I arrive 1 minute before my shift.   Then all of a sudden a cat comes through the front seats onto my armrest and stretches out his front paws and yawns.  The little bastard was sleeping in my back seat and I didnt see him.  Mind you, my windows were only down the length of a stretched out hand.  It wasn't until weeks later I saw him in action doing the same thing.  he climbed on me roof and ninja himself through the crack upside down.



The fuckup is, I had to tell my boss I had to go back home because my cat is in my car.  That alone was an awkward story to tell, but since this makes me 20 minutes late it puts me over penalty points and I got fired a few days later.  No big deal, hated that job.

t3_kuqf3t,"TIFU by taking ""You won't like this"" literally.","Over the years when it comes to certain foods at family reunions, Sunday dinners, or at a BBQ hosted by friends, people tasting things will sometimes tell me that I will not like it, along with a funny smile or smirk of a sort.

Since these people are of course trusted family and friends, I took them at their word and simply did not taste or eat the food they pointed out. After all, they are just looking out for me and I have no reason to suspect or question their word on such a simple thing such as food. There was almost always plenty of other food to eat.

Today, I find out they have all freaking lied to me. Decided to eat something anyways and omg was it delicious.

t3_kupk8o,"TIFU by explaining to a young Muslim girl, what porn is.","Obligatory this didn't actually happen today but 7-8 years ago, but it still makes me cringe and I still think about it a lot. So here goes:

&amp;#x200B;

I used to teach English in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and I had students from all over the world and a significant number were from East Asia and the Middle East. This particular class, almost all of them were from Libya. IDK if you're familiar with the Arabic language but they lack certain sounds e.g. ""chuh"" and in ""Chair"" or ""Puh"" as in ""Person"". For instance instead of pronouncing it ""Pepsi"" they call it ""Bebsi"".

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm in class doing this exercise with them to help their pronunciation where you place a piece of paper in from of your mouth and say a work that starts with ""b"" like ""born"" and the paper has to stay still, and you say a word that starts with ""p"" like ""pen"" and you have to push a puff of air out with the ""p"" to make the paper move. It just sounds like a breathy, exaggerated ""p"" but it helps them differentiate between ""b"" and ""p"".

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway class is over and this young maybe 18-19 y.o, very sweet Muslim girl comes to my desk and she goes ""teacher what is porn?"" with a very exaggerated, breathy ""p"", and I kind of get flushed and mumbled a little and try to explain:

""Well... It's like a movie but for adults, not for kids... It's not very nice""

""Movie for old beoble?""

""Well not exactly old people, but it shows things that aren't suitable for younger people, It shows people begin very close to each other""

""Teacher, I don't understand. What mean when you say ""I was porn in Libya""

So apparently she was still stuck on the exercise and was pronouncing all Bs as hard Ps. At this point I'm turning purple for trying to teach her about porn and I'm struggling to explain birth without using my hands and mimicking a vagina. So I tell her in means it's your country and look it up in a dictionary.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Young mulling students asks me a question incorrectly, I end up explaining her to her what adult movies are. SMH",85,11,tifu

And I guess they always assumed. But 4 years went by and about 2 years ago in a manic episode I guess I went kind of crazy on my buddy, and wasn't to nice. But now 2 years later and another manic episode later. I was being super paranoid and figured I would touch base with them again after fucking my life up in every other way imaginable. And BOOM they brought it up. At first I just said I lied about it all together, then it turned into a lady I had met online, and then I told them ""who it was"" but I lied about it. Im just worried about them telling who they assumed something even though they still don't have concrete evidence. We are all grown, they don't nessecarily have contact or a relationship with the people in said affair. But its a small town. I dont know if I am being paranoid, would yall not say anything not having any evidence. I am just so scared. I dont want to ruin my lovers life or her family. I think I am just being paranoid. I know this is probably a poorly constructed ramble.

At this point in my pregnancy I cant see jack shit down there, and a mirror doesn‚Äôt work super well. So my dear husband has been doing periodic investigations to reassure me that my organs are still mostly inside my body and give an update to the whole sitch. He‚Äôs an incredibly funny man who has an expressive face, which is a big part of why It went off the rails.

He‚Äôs down there taking a look, and he is not holding back: he looks pained, like he‚Äôs viewing a corpse, telling me (lovingly, as a joke) that it looks like ‚Äúa hamburger‚Äù down there, and generally giving an unfavorable report. This is all too much for me and my raging hormones, which either having me laughing, crying, or murdering kittens.

t3_kuolz6,TIFU by making someone think I was going to murder and bury her,"This just happened and I can't believe I didn't think about the situation. For reference I am a pretty big guy, and don't exactly look like a teddy bear. I posted a folding wagon online and someone said she wanted it. To both of our surprise we work at the same hospital so drop-off / pickup would be easy. Our hospital is huge so she agreed to meet me at my car in a parking garage. The wagon was in my car and we greeted one another and I opened my trunk to get the wagon out. She immediately stepped back when I opened the trunk, then I saw it.

I will take a step back to mention that I spent last weekend at my parents house helping them tear down a shed and a bunch of trees. I had all the tools at my house so I brought them over to help. The tools include a shovel, pickaxe, sledgehammer, recirpocating saw, axe, hatchet, hacksaw, large blue tarp, work gloves and rope. They were all covered in mud. It was literally a murder and disposal kit, that all looked well used. I just put them in my trunk and forgot to take them out. I didn't notice them when I put the wagon in because it was morning and still very dark.

I explained the situation and took the wagon out for her. She ended up being coworkers with my mom, and remembered my mom mentioning the new shed at work a few weeks prior. So we had a laugh about it in the end, but I was certain I would be maced or tazed for sure.

TL;DR
I met a woman alone in a parking garage to sell her something from my trunk and left a DIY murder set in my car.

t3_kuo3st,TIFU by making old fashioned pop corn.,"A while back, I decided to have some popcorn while watching The Mentalist. The only kind I had was the loose kernel kind you have to pop in a pan in a little bit of oil.


I have never done this before but thought it'd be fun and I could make a unique flavor with bacon grease, butter, smoked salt, etc. 


When the oil was ready, it said to put a single layer of kernels in the bottom of the pan. I did that, and 30 seconds later, everything was on fire...


The kernals popped SO fast that they Overflowed out the pan and went all over the stovetop. Even when I took the pan off the heat, they kept popping and flying out and quite a few landed on the burner, immediately bursting into flame. 


So now I'm juggling this still popping overflowing pan while frantically trying to blow out the little popcorn fires when I accidentally blow one onto the counter and up against a roll of paper towels which, you guessed it, also started burning. 


Oh, and I was shirtless, getting peppered with hot drops of grease and oil the whole time. I went from ""Can't wait for some popcorn!"" to ""EVERYTHING'S ON FIRE!!!"" in the span of about 15-20 seconds.


I finally set the pan on the floor, still popping a bit, and a grabbed some tongs to pick up the half enflamed roll of paper towels and tossed it into the sink, dousing it with the sprayer. The popcorn that was on the burner had mostly burned out. Their little fires were short lived but Intense. I blew out the remaining embers, caught my breath, and looked at the smokey remains of my ~~life~~ kitchen.


I saved about a third of the popcorn, what had stayed in the pan. The rest I swept up and tossed. Then I cleaned up the stove, got a well deserved beer from the fridge, and sat down with my snack to resume my show but... it honestly didn't even taste that good.

t3_kulmen,TIFU drove the car into an electric fence gate.,"This actually happened yesterday as one of my few driving lessons. I am in my early teenage years, so I am still trying to get a hang of the car. I had taken driving lessons so I was feeling really confident to start doing chores for my parents. My parents drove first to leave my grandmother at her house and then I took the wheel.

I was a bit nervous cause we had to drive through a route I didnt know much about. Driving up the hill, a car is parked really close to my lane and I proceed to hit its rear view mirror. The guy followed us and as we parked we ended up owing him about 20$

We went to do the chore and I was given the car again to take us back home. I was more familiar with this route and so I got us home with no issues. Fast forward a couple of hours, my dad wants me to take the car again to do the last chore of the day, picking up a shirt.

Drove all the way there with no problems, and then we had to go through some security to get to the neighborhood. My dad already seemed like he was in a bad mood, so I was nervous to say the least. They made us wait for a couple more minutes, which just made his mood even worse.

After a good 15 min, they let me through and this is were it all went downhill. I was pretty sure I was hitting the breaks but the car kept moving and my dad screamed at me to stop the car since the electrical fence gate was still opening up. I panicked, confused at why the car wasn't coming to a stop I changed my foot from the break, to the pedal. 

This went as bad as you can imagine, the huge door that was opening infront of us, had yet to be openend completely and so I drove right into it and basically slammed it open. My heart was racing and I was basically in shock. I managed to stop the car but the damage had already been done.

We're still waiting for the total cost of the fence gate, but its safe to say I wont be driving again any time soon. Due to this little accident, I will also be missing my senior trip due to the costs of repairing the fence gate and repairing the damage done to the front of the car.

t3_kujxty,"TIFU by completely flipping my lid, breaking a stick, and berating my own mother for the way she's been treating her new dog.","So, to start off, I'm a fairly quiet person; I keep to myself, I (unhealthily) bottle up a lot of those nasty feelings, and I usually just try my best to stay out of things, but that usually just ends up in me losing my patience and then blowing up, especially when it comes to my family. My family is dysfunctional, stubborn, and (not to be sexist, I promise) the women will ***ALWAYS*** gang up against whatever unfortunate soul decides to breathe wrong in their presence.  


So, on to where I fucked up... Well, my mother has the patience of a spoiled toddler, and will snap and get mad at just about anything that is a mild inconvenience to her sedentary and self-indulging lifestyle. Makes me wonder sometimes why she even bothered to have/keep me, and why she bothers to get animals that need to be trained so they know commands and/or what not to do. So, she recently got a puppy not even a month after our previous girl passed, and I wasn't too happy about it, but I wasn't about to stop her. This puppy is very spoiled, has little to no training, and has enough energy to act as a generator for my neighborhood. She's been an inside dog for a good bit now, and occasionally has an accident or two in the house, I mean... It's understandable. She's just a pup, and she still needs to learn, but my mother is just like ""OH MY GOD! FUCKING DOG! NO! OUTSIDE!"" pretty much dragging to poor girl out by the collar, stomping her way over to the little puddle, cleaning it up, and then yelling at the pup to go to bathroom outside, but she won't because all of it was on the very-easy-to-clean tile-floor.  


The pup tends to get into quite a bit of trouble when left unsupervised. Let's say we leave her outside for a little bit to go to the bathroom or something, yeah? Well, she'll start digging in the garden, getting under rabbit hutches, chewing up dead leaves and tree bark, and eating things she probably shouldn't. Rather than taking the time to teach the dog, my mother will chase her. Pup doesn't know any better, thinks she's playing, and will run away with whatever new toy or snack she managed to pick up. So, what really got my blood boiling is when I saw my mother chasing the poor dog with a stick, swinging it at her, yelling at her, being an all-around bitch with anger-management issues, and I was having none of it anymore. I went down there, took the stick, broke it into little pieces, and threw it right over the fence. Yeah, she didn't like that. She started yelling at me, asking why I did that, raising her tone as if I had just done the worst thing she could possibly imagine, and, when it comes to my family, thanks to the years and years of abuse I've had to endure, the limit to the shit I can put up with is riiiiiiight above 0. Maybe 0.02. The more she yelled, the more I found myself yelling. The more she talked over me, the more I found myself telling her to ""shut up and listen."" I made a mistake, I didn't stay calm, I let her push me over the edge, and she ran with it, trying to pull the ""parent card"". I yelled, and yelled, and yelled, berating her for not actually training the dog to do anything, but instead teaching her to be afraid, abusing her into obedience. It didn't feel good, but I couldn't stop. Every word I said just pulled more out with it. I even said ""listen, princess, nobody is going to cater to your every need and make sure you don't get hurt."" ... It's not like I've never fought with her, but I've never gone this far. I've never had a reason to tell her that she doesn't just refuse criticism, but she takes it as a full-on attack. She pretends like everyone is out to get her, like everyone wants to blame her for something, and it's fucking annoying. I told her it was annoying... I told her that ***she*** was annoying... I said way too much, and now she's doing the usual silent-treatment, actively avoiding me, not even bothering to look my way. Feels like she doesn't want me to exist, and sometimes I wish I didn't either, but tough shit. She never wants to admit she's wrong, so when she's told that she is, she doubles down, refuses to admit fault, and then pouts because ""*ThEy WeRe MeAn To Me*!""  


I'm 24, jobless, friendless, a failure, and I have no right doing this shit when I am basically an overgrown dependent. I could get kicked onto the street at a moment's notice, and so I've been treading lightly, but this was the final fucking straw, man... I'm scared that I may not have a home if I cross another line like that, but I couldn't just say nothing. I'd be enabling her to keep doing the same shit, and I didn't want to be responsible for that. Funny enough, she's been treating the dog better now, but I shouldn't have had to risk everything just to change that.  


  
tl;dr I fucked up by breaking the stick my mother used to try and punish her puppy, and ended up letting 24 years of pent up frustration flow out of my mouth, potentially putting my living situation at risk. Something had to be done, but I fear that I could have finally crossed the line.",19,14,tifu
t3_kujfwl,TIFU by sniffin' on straight chlorine,"To be honest with you, I've always been a lazy person when it comes to breakfast. I usually skip it altogether and just eat when I'm actually hungry, but today I got the idea - what if I just eat some yoghurt with some oatmeal and seeds etc.?
Yeah...Great! So, this is where the fuck up starts.
So, here I am, just pouring some yoghurt in a bowl, and looking for the rest of the ingredients. My SO's family got us bunch of oatmeal, flaxseed, sunflower seeds and a couple of jars with teas and stuff the other day (they are the type to give you something 'cause ""you will need it!""), so I have a fair choice.
One of the jars contained tiny, white granules, which were kind of transparent under the kitchen light.
-Oh, this could be sea salt! Mmm, when was the last time we got this? Let's open it and inhale the smell of mermaids' kingdom!
As I opened the jar, my nostrils that looked forward to smell the ocean, almost ruptured in shock and disappointment. That sharp, kind of sulfury vapor even made insides of my mouth taste like a pool as I inhaled it.
I closed the jar immediately and shoved it back in the kitchen cabinet. With a slight pulsating headache, I still had my breakfast.

TL;DR: Thought I could spice up my yoghurt with some ocean beauty, ended up inhaling chlorine that smells like ocean fart.",14,9,tifu
t3_kuj2vu,TIFU by sitting on the toilet for too long,"So this happened a year ago. I was invited to my buddy‚Äôs place for a little get together. I don‚Äôt usually attend but wanted to be a part of the festivities that everyone talks about at work. I decide to go and after eating a few things I needed to sneak away to take a shit. I find a bathroom down the hall so I sit and scroll through apps on my phone. About 30 minutes later I feel my leg tingling so it‚Äôs time to get up. I clean myself up and go to pull my pants up. I take one step and my leg is FULLY asleep. I lose my balance and go crashing into the bathtub. I rip down the shower curtain and rod. Everyone comes rushing in to help me up. I‚Äôm a bigger guy. Every friend group has one. The funny fat guy. Everyone makes a few jokes and even a few at work for a couple of weeks. Then the pandemic hit and we all started working from home. No more jokes about the incident. Perfect for me. 

Well today my buddy sends me a picture of him helping me out of his bathtub with my pants halfway around my ass. I had almost forgotten about it. I asked where he got the pic? He said that one of the other people at the party snapped a pic and since Apple now does this thing where they highlight a picture you‚Äôve taken on this day, that person sent him the pic. I thought the whole thing had blown over but there I was, ass up, wrapped in a shower curtain in my buddy‚Äôs bathtub because my leg fell asleep. 

My take away is fuck Apple for reminding me about this shitshow of a day from last year.

TL;DR I sat on the toilet too long and my leg fell asleep. I fell into a friends bathtub and someone took a picture of it.",21,8,tifu
t3_kuj1am,"TIFU by hitting a toddler in the head with a swing, TWICE","For some background: In Autumn, the have this farm kinda thing that opens up. They have the typical kind of things, like pumpkin patches, corn mazes, kettle corn, that kind of stuff. At this farm, they have a swing at a top of a hill. The swing connects to a tree branch, and leads to the ground by the hill. Also by the hill is a small stream (you would have had to have been there to really get it).

The Cast: Me, my friend D, and a random lady, who I will call RL.

This takes place about 5 years ago, I was probably about 10. Me and D really wanted to go on the swing, so we got in line. I go on once, and I love it. So I get back in line to try it again. But as I get to the front of the line, there is a lady getting some kids out of the way of the stream (I'm pretty sure the kids were triplets, probably toddlers). 

At this point, it's my turn to get on the swing, so I hop on and push of the hill. But as I'm heading down on the swing, on of the triplets runs back to the stream. I try to stop or swerve around the kid, but I am too late. The swing smacked the kid right in the head, causing him to fall into the stream. As the swing starts to swing back, however, the kid gets back up. The swing then hits the kid in the back of the head, knocking him over again. 

At this point, the lady runs over, and takes the kid away, while the kid is screaming bloody murder. Some other lady runs over, and we have this conversation:

RL: ""Why did you do that!?""

Me: ""I don't know! I tried to stop!""

RL: ""Yeah, sure.""

Me and D walk away, talking about what happened. I look over and see the kid with his family, getting patched up. 

I feel terrible about what happened. I could've caused that kid seriously bad, permanent, head problems. I probably also killed any love for swings he had.

TL;DR I smashed a kid in the head with a swing, TWICE, probably causing serious head problems.",9,2,tifu
t3_kuhed1,TIFU by getting rid of my christmas tree,"Bug warning. 

So it‚Äôs time. Having the tree up any longer would have made me feel lazy and pathetic instead of full of holiday cheer, and it‚Äôs starting to drop needles, so I start on the process of removing ornaments and garlands to get rid of the tree.

I take off most of the ornaments and start on the garlands. On garland two I see a few stick bugs that run back into the tree. Eh, it‚Äôs from a forest, a few are normal. NBD.

I go to get the next garland and accidentally shake the branch, and then six- six!- tiny bugs fall onto the table next to the tree. I freeze. 

Wait. Those are not stick bugs. I look closer.

I had assumed stick bugs cause the only ones I‚Äôve ever seen are very tiny and sway when threatened in an attempt to ‚Äúmove with the wind.‚Äù

These are swaying but they are not stick bugs. I look closer.

They are baby praying mantises.

Oh no.

I know praying mantises are supposed to be large. These are not large. These are /tiny/. Which means somewhere on this tree‚Äî

I look back at the tree, and realise what I previously thought was a stubborn pinecone is not, in fact, a pinecone, and is /erupting with baby praying mantises/. Hundreds. 

Oh, fuck me.

I ask my spouse, ‚ÄúDo you care about these lights?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he says in confusion.

‚ÄúGreat. Come here and help me get this into the tree bag, we got some bugs.‚Äù I am speaking dead calm. ‚ÄúAnd can you get me a vacuum?‚Äù

He‚Äôs cooking. He does not understand the severity of the situation. The tree is moving only it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs just the /amount of praying mantises shifting on it/. ‚ÄúIn a second.‚Äù

I do not have a second.

I get the vacuum. I vacuum the nest right off the tree, and then attempt to get every praying mantis that I can see in some bizarre parody of Ghostbusters. 

‚ÄúNo really. We need to get this tree /into the bin bag/,‚Äù I say, calm as fuck, which is wild cause inwardly I am screaming cause I have the creepy crawly sensation all over my skin.

‚ÄúOkay, okay,‚Äù he says. He comes over and holds the tree. 

I duck under to loosen the screws. Six fall on my head and neck. I shake them off and keep unscrewing. I feel them anyway. They live in the sensation on my skin now.

We get half of the tree in the bag when we smell smoke. The oil he was heating in the pan is about to catch fire cause he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt expecting this to take that long‚Äù. He rushes back to the kitchen. Somehow he has not had a single bug on him. I am left holding up the tree with no free hands to swat the ones parading down my arms toward my face. I blow them off of me like Gimli trying to blow away ghosts in the mountain.

He comes back. We finally get the tree in the bag and the bag to the tree disposal area for our apartments. I come upstairs and vacuum again, playing ghostbusters along the walls and ceiling where they are swaying. I start to feel a little bad. Not their fault they were born in my house. Still gonna vacuum them though.

Go about my day attempting to ignore the crawling sensation.

Come back to the room a few hours later. There are six on the wall. Ask husband why he didn‚Äôt vacuum them. 

He /couldn‚Äôt see them/. They are so small that unless he got super close he only saw smudges because his prescription is out of date!!! No wonder he wasn‚Äôt freaked out!!! 

TL:DR: Tree infested with bugs, I was the only one who got freaked out cause my husband needs new glasses.",17,12,tifu
t3_kuhbxk,TIFU by popping a HUGE blood blister on my inner thigh at my desk at work.,"Ok so this is gross and super embarrassing but it was to funny not to share.. 

I have had a painfully huge blood blister or infected boil or something on my inner thigh for about a week or so. It is so big its like a baseball stuck in my leg.  I mean this thing is ANGRY and solid as a stone. I should probably have seen a doctor for the infection at this point but anyway.

I was coming back from the breakroom to my desk. I was the first worker back in the office from break due to me wearing shorts and trying to vape outside in 40¬∞F weather. I'm one of those year round big dudes with shorts on no matter what. I go to sit down and get a jolt of pain. Its the boil. I decide no one is in the office let me take a look at this thing. I roll up my shorts just a little bit to get a peek. It is the most menacing bump I have ever seen. I poke it and it is hot to the touch and at complete max capacity. Not really thinking about it I give it a little squeeze to see how bad it would hurt if I tried to pop it later to release the pressure.... I would not get that chance as the light squeeze was enough to trigger a chain reaction....

It ruptures and squirts a mixture of dark red blood and pus clear across the room. We have an open desk layout no cubicles. Due to Covid19 these desks are spread out 6 ft apart from each other. It clears the neighboring desk with ease and just disappears as I lose focus of the stream of pure evil exiting my body. Blood then squirts all over the floor at my desk, on my hands, on my KHAKI shorts.. I immediately stand up as I hear coworkers Talking and laughing in the hall to the office. A complete panic floods my brain. How the hell am I going to explain all the blood running down my leg to the floor... the blood on my hands and shorts.. There are going to think I'm having some kind of major medical emergency... I look at the splatter on the desk next to me and just know there is no way in hell i can clean all this up before the door opens  ..

I have had an idea ... 

I stuck my hand back up my shorts and just gave the boil a teeth clinching squeeze. I get a absolute disturbing amount of blood all over my hand and run towards the door that the coworkers are coming in. I open it with my shoulder holding one hand up with the other one like I cut off a finger. They all freeze as I run by them covered in blood. I just yell ""I cut my hand on my desk watch out for it!' which thinking back on it don't make much sense but that's the phrase my brain chose in absolute panic. With me busting out the door covered in blood was such a shock I don't think they really even thought about what I said..  We have first aid kits hanging in the main hallway I open it up and grab a handful of Band-Aids and run into the bathroom.

&amp;#x200B;

I realize I have like 30 seconds or less till someone comes in here to check on me... I turn the water on and wet my had and look down.. the shorts are a total loss.. but I can get the blood of my leg so I do that. looking down I notice the boil has been squirting blood ever step I have taken... I had probably left a trail like a wounded animal all the way down the hall. I start frantically sticking band-aids to my hand and a few to my leg to stop the actual source of the blood when one of the safety team people walk into the bathroom to see if I'm ok.  I told him ""I cut my hand on my.... scissors ... at my desk and there is blood around it and I trailed it to the bathroom.  I'm fine but I might go to the doctor to get it checked out."" He tells me to go ahead and they will get someone to clean up the blood.. (Sorry to that individual.. sure hope you don't use Reddit...)

The charade worked. I have now pushed off all consequences of my actions today until tomorrow... 

 TLDR: Busted a discussing boil full of blood at work and had to lie that I cut my hand to try to get out of the embarrassment of explaining what really happened.",33,11,tifu
t3_kugvcz,TIFU for eating late at night,"So I was home alone all night. I got lazy to prepare dinner, so that's why even if I'm hungry, I decided to sleep without eating.

However, when my parents arrived at 10pm, they bought me a take out which consists of a huge serving of burger and 12"" pizza. Since I'm hungry, I ended up eating too fast, and I choked. Unfortunately, the water dispenser is empty, and I have no choice but to change the bottle while choking! At this point, I'm surprised I didn't pass out while doing that because it is freaking dangerous.

But my suffering doesn't end here. Now, I can't freaking sleep because I got upset stomach. I've been going back and forth to the toilet to poop. My ass freaking hurt already, and I don't think I'm done. I'll probably have two more trips later.

Nope, not yet done. The toilet fucking stinks. We also ran out of air freshener. Thankfully, I used the toilet downstair (all rooms are upstairs) so no one can smell it. But my main concern is the pungent smell has reached the living room, and I fear that it might stay the whole freaking night. üò≠

t3_kuency,Tifu by sitting too close to the fire to escape hell.,"TL/DR down the bottom. 

Note: Maybe not suitable for arachnophobes. 

So this happened about 10 years ago in Australia, just outside of Jindabyne, NSW, we were all around 20 years old at the time and were looking forward to letting loose a little. 

A group of about ten of us went on a trip to a holiday house in New South Wales‚Äô mountain region. It wasn‚Äôt cold enough to snow but the nights were pretty crisp, so we pulled up an old outdoor bbq and proceeded to build a fire. As it usually goes, the size of the fire continued to grow, and we were all nestling into our positions around it for optimal warmth. 

Then a couple of the boys came back from a wood hunt with a big branch that was pretty fresh (about 3-4 meters long and it requires 3 people to lift it) then they placed the heavy end on the fire, and we sat down to watch it catch. 

It was a fairly slow process because the fire wasn‚Äôt really big enough for the branch to catch quickly, and there was a bit of smoke due to the big chunk of bark wrapped around the end in the fire. 

Once it began to catch I scootched my seat a bit closer and bathed happily in the warmth. 

At this point someone said ‚Äúwhat the fuck?!‚Äù And another shouted ‚ÄúITS BREATHING!‚Äù As he pointed at the huge piece of bark which was now literally breathing in and out against the branch. We could hear sizzling and we all jumped up. Then it began. 

One Huntsman spider (big scary/hairy Mofo‚Äôs which are basically harmless in a giant Shaq-like way) crawled out of gap between the branch and bark and then just fell into the fire to die. Then another, and another and within 30 seconds it seemed like there were hundreds pouring out trying to escape the heat (imagine World War Z zombies but spiders). They quickly discovered they could avoid the fire by just running down the log and jumping onto the grass or going the whole way into darkness. 

I jumped up on my seat, as did a few others while the rest just ran onto the concrete into the safety of the light. Soon enough the whole ground was alive with spiders running through the grass and into the darkness. I was stuck on my seat just looking around at this waiting for it to end... but they just kept on pouring out of under the bark and either escaping or sizzling in the fire. The log was alive. Looking at the ground was like a horror acid trip, and the only thing protecting me was the old wirey camping chair I was perched on. 

Yet it kept on going. More spiders! The guys on the concrete were laughing because they didn‚Äôt want to go into the light and of course me and the other guys stuck in the spider sea like me were screaming and laughing hysterically. It was the end of the fucking world. 

After probably only 2 minutes (felt like much longer) the stream of spiders began to fade and the ones that made it were presumably making a break in the darkness for the trees while their comrades cooked. It died down surprisingly quickly because where their ‚Äònest‚Äô was was now completely in flames and we all jumped up onto the concrete. 

After ten minutes the log was burning perfectly, we were getting chilly, and there literally wasn‚Äôt a spider in sight. We shook off our seats, checked every nook and cranny nearby, and after giving it enough thought, we all eased back into our positions and laughed traumatically until the adrenaline rush passed. It was so creepy that we literally couldn‚Äôt find a single one of them in the grass or around us but we figure we just had to do our best to stop thinking about it and continue drinking. 

TLDR: Sat to close to fire and I couldn‚Äôt escape an exodus of large spiders, so had to wait it out while standing on my seat.

Edit: whoa thanks for the awards but pease don‚Äôt use your money on this!!! And shoutout to the arachnophobes who dodged a bullet. 

P.S. As an Aussie, I understand the fear of the creepy crawlies... but I will take seeing a deadly spider or snake from a meter away any day, over seeing a bear or wolf from a mile!!!",15734,498,tifu

So the tech addicted Peter came with his tablet and his smartphone. Sat near my grandma and started playing. Both the tablet and his smartphone have an iphone sticker on the back, for the fun I guess, because neither is Apple's product.

Later in the day some family members including my uncle &amp; son went for a short walk. My grandma and I stayed.

Grandma asks me : ""You saw? Small Peter has an iPhone right? Must be expensive""
Me: ""No no, those are just stickers""
Grandma : ""Oh haha, it looks pretty anyways""

Then I recall that I have 2 new stickers which came with a Macbook that I recently bought. So I decide to give 1 of them to Peter when he comes back.

He returns, I show him the gold colored sticker, he seems excited, we start the replacement process. Peter takes his smartphone, pulls off the old Apple sticker and handles the phone to me. I place the new sticker by making sure that it covers the ""SAMSUNG"" mark that was hidden by previous sticker.

I am proud of myself. The new sticker is way shinier and is perfectly centered. Peter thanks me but seems concerned. 5 mins later he approaches his father and I hear him say ""Daddy, daddy ... my phone is a Samsung ... did you know? ..."".

I shouldn't had given him the new sticker.

t3_kudy9i,TIFU by being the crazy neighbor,"For backstory, we've had a lot of thefts in my area lately. People are constantly posting to different neighborhood apps with clips of people going thru their cars and stealing from their yards.

Starting around 3am, my outside cameras were triggering and sending me alerts. I'd half wake up, see people on the video of the shared driveway, and assume it was the neighbors or their friends partying (I could see that the people walking by were on that side of the driveway). I didn't see anyone carrying away my shit so, yeah, I wasn't getting up.

At about 5:30am, I get an alert from my backyard. Then one from my front door. I see one person standing there with their hand out gesturing to someone off camera. The second person walks over from the direction of my backyard and my dad's car. They walk away and are looking at something in their hands. Maybe. Idk it's 5am and I've been getting woken up all night. I go to my front window and I see them walking by and they start moving faster when they see me.

My half asleep brain said ""go fuck em up, scare those junkies so they don't come back"". I go outside and yell ""hey!"". They start walking faster. I'm following them down the street, barefoot (cause my barely functioning brain also decided we don't need shoes), and trying to get my camera recording on my phone. They turn into a neighbor's driveway, one of the few that has a fence low enough to hop over to get to the next street over. Just as I got there, I heard a door close. Oh no. I think I just chased some neighbors from down the block lol.

Needless to say, I'm sitting here feeling pretty stupid and thinking I'm the new crazy lady on the street, which is really saying something considering the current crazy lady is completely batshit. Awesome.

t3_kud8mp,TIFU (Fake Name/Broken Hearts),"So to start off this with some context. I‚Äôm in a more obscure part of the Pok√©mon community called the Shiny Hunting Community. It‚Äôs basically where we take our free time and hunt for shiny Pok√©mon. Now keep in mind that this is a close-knit and bonded community. It‚Äôs not uncommon for us to meet up and hang out with each other. At least the ones who have known each other for years.

When I was 16, I first entered the bigger part of the community, the Discord server. Everyone knew my name and such, but there was one problem: I couldn‚Äôt take a joke, I was overly sensitive, and I took being teased as being harassed. I left the community for a bit, becoming a lot more mature than I was. 

I was ready to come back to the community; afraid that they would still see me as the same, immature person I was a year prior. So what do I do? Give myself a pseudonym (fake name). That‚Äôs all, I didn‚Äôt change anything else. 

Throughout the year (17-18yo), I was going by this alias, having a good time, and making a lot of friends. While doing so, one of the guys caught feelings for me. He confessed it to me in front of the entire server, if I weren‚Äôt so intent on keeping my secret, I probably would‚Äôve fell for him too. He was very sweet. People would tease him about it and constantly. I never joined in on it, but I never did anything to stop it. He left the server while I was away on hiatus because of it. Only now do I realize how awful I was to him. While it made me uncomfortable to say the least, I didn‚Äôt do anything when I should‚Äôve. He was always saying he wanted to be closer to me, to meet me, and how it hurt him that we weren‚Äôt closer. 

I eventually went on hiatus again for while, wanting to share my secret, but I was always unsure of how everyone would act. I eventually told a close friend the truth, and he encouraged me to tell the others. Fast forward a few months: I do. (18 yo, a year after making a fake name.)

They all just laughed about it, they still call me by the fake name, I like it better. But the guy who had feelings for me took it horribly. He was telling me how horrible a person I was, that I could‚Äôve told everyone sooner, how everyone teased him about ‚Äúus‚Äù, and he‚Äôs right, I could‚Äôve told everyone a lot sooner than I did. 

My excuse at the time was: ‚ÄúI had no other choice, I was scared.‚Äù Okay, so? I let this go on much longer than it needed to, while it was unintentional, I should‚Äôve stepped in and said something before-hand. I‚Äôm pretty sure I destroyed his heart and sense of trust. Only now do I realize I could‚Äôve handled the situation a lot better, said other things, maybe I would‚Äôve still had a friend in the end. I never meant to hurt him the way I did. If I could turn back the clock to fix my horrible mistake, I would. All I know... is I messed up big time. 

TLDR: 
-Joined community and was immature
-came back a year later using a different name
-guy caught feelings for me, community teased him
-I tell the truth a year later. Most of the community is cool, he has a breakdown.
-Name calling, excuses, and a broken heart.",0,5,tifu

I was mostly there to visit their animals (they have a mini donkey.. and this creepily-too-friendly little goat that tried to follow me into their house) , because family banter in my neck of the woods is about as pro-cheeto as you can get, and it‚Äôs the same old same old. They had my 9 year old cousin programmed to say ‚ÄúI love Tr*mp! He‚Äôs better than Lyin‚Äô Biden! That creep!‚Äù like one of those old pull-the-string to talk toys (she really believed it, though) and that says enough. She also regaled my sister and I with the tale of Mermgleskofen, or some weird norse word that she seemed very intent on letting us know it meant ‚ÄúLittle Black Boy‚Äù, her prize-winning angus beef steer. We got to see him in all his meaty glory. She was... so proud.. of him. 

ANYWAY, I crack open a couple twisted teas to cope with the poor decision making that brought me to even ATTEMPTING to engage in some kind of fulfilling conversation with these guys. Now - these weren‚Äôt any twisted teas - my uncle‚Äôs wife‚Äôs friend (who I totally think shags both of them on the regular because they were looking at each other real odd and weirdly kinda flirting after getting about six or so beers ahead of me but let‚Äôs not talk about that) brought them in, complaining about how freezing she was from the cold from the horseback ride she went on over her huge 100 acre property! So, naturally, someone tells her to get a better coat. Ironically, now, she responds - ‚ÄúI am one broke [racial slur!], I can‚Äôt buy no Carhartt!‚Äù You.. you..you literally were just talking about riding a horse you own on 100 acres of your own property. Owning a horse is expensive, but.. come on. 

Anyway, this warrants a couple more teas. I‚Äôm balls deep into four cans by now, and then. 

Here it comes..

The love of my life. The absolute best time I will ever have. My little cousin comes scooting in from some corner of the house on this absolute beauty of modern technology: A hoverboard with an attachment that turns it into a gokart, blasting God‚Äôs Country by Eric Church thanks to the nifty bluetooth speakers. (With matching lights) Like a sweet and cherubic future-goblin angel, she drifts a corner around the table and into the living room and asks, ‚ÄúWanna drive it?‚Äù 

So of course, I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúOh you betcha‚Äù and to my inebriated bliss, I am whipping absolute shitties in the living room on this blessing of modern ingenuity. HAVING A BLAST. I felt like a real formula one racer, tokyo drift mode.. I will spend my life chasing this high. And then it happened.. I was very swiftly reminded why DUI‚Äôs exist. One wrong movement and I send the cart (and my ass) at Mach 10 into the living room table, causing what one might call a small seismic event inside my cousin‚Äôs 50 gallon fish tank. Nothing was *too* terribly disturbed, but all I‚Äôm going to say is twenty minutes later (after I decided drunk hoverkarting may not have been the brightest plan), my cousin was staring very intently at the fish tank asking, ‚ÄúDad, why is he sleeping on the pebbles?‚Äù

Uncle very curtly inspects the tank, and says, ‚ÄúOh, that fucker is dead.‚Äù 

Meanwhile I‚Äôm sitting in a corner, smiling and minding my own business. Uhhh yeah, haha!  I dunno what happened there! 

TL;DR: Go to a small family dinner party, get drunk to deal with discourse, end up driving a hoverboard gokart into a fishtank and indirectly killing a fish.",0,1,tifu

Soo I was by the sink washing dishes right before we are about to leave for a gig and my friend made fun of the way I was saying marigold (the flower) and I jokingly kicked behind me to get him to stop turns out I smacked him right on the knee and he starts screaming and trying to hold onto something I thought he was joking around with me cause he normally does but he‚Äôs still continuing to scream after I laugh at him 

Turns out I DISLOCATED his knee and popped it out of its socket... minutes before we left to play at a gig. 
This happen tonight he‚Äôs still currently in so much pain because we had to go straight to the gig and we currently just finished as I‚Äôm typing this. I feel awful cause he had to stand this entire time on his leg AHHH

t3_kucrkx,TIFU by not taking piles seriously,"TLDR: Went on a celebratory major city break and, somehow got piles a few days prior to leaving. Ended up leaving a heritage museums bathroom in a bad way. 

So, this didn't happen today however, I think the dust has settled and enough time gone by that it is safe to post also, my partner, let's call her Lupita, still isn't aware of this. 

Last year, it was a big birthday for myself so Lupita treated me to a major trip away to NYC, a first for me and her.  Unfortunately for me, a few days prior to leaving Istarted to experience a bit of pain when going to the toilet and in general (sitting down, walking etc).

Having never dealt with anything like piles (little hemorrhoids/lumps and bumps in and around the butt hole. Particularly discomforting 10/10 would not recommend) before, I did what any rational male would do... Ignored it. Refusing to believe it may be because I'm getting older and, hoped I would be somehow cured in time for our trip away by doing absolutely nothing.

The trip comes around, involving a drive of a few hours to get to the airport...Great. Rather uneventful, just the odd jiggling around to get comfortable. Then the flight...8 hours of trying to balance on one cheek to ease the discomfort.

We get there, the first few days are pretty typical of what has now become the norm...Uncomfortable pain in whatever activity I'm doing however, once in a lifetime trip, you're gonna just get on with it right?

One day we head to a heritage museum after a particularly long walk (FU PT 1). Literally 10 minutes in to a 3 hour museum trip (thankfully unguided) I get a weird sort of medicinal smell and feel like I've got a super sweaty butt. After a couple of comments from Lupita about it smelling like sweaty feet (I hope my feet don't smell like that) I proceed to walk behind her while trying to give everyone else in there (luckily it was quiet) a gap of about 3 meters.

After pretty much the full tour, made my excuses and headed to the bathroom. Just as I thought, one/multiple of the piles had burst. There was so much blood. As in I'm not sure how I didn't feel faint kind of amount. I proceeded to try and get rid of as much as possible in one of those odd, the bottom of the door is pretty much in line with my manhood American bathrooms. At the thought of being seen with my trousers down while wiping at a severely bloody butt, I speed wiped to clear up as much of the monstrosity as possible, in my haste forgetting to flush as I went (FU PT 2). This did not sit well with the toilet as I flushed and the ever rising tide looked like it was going to rush over the top of the bowl like the ever growing tide of shame was washing over me. Thankfully it stopped and just sat there, settling enough to look deep in to my eyes through the reflection and question who I a really am as a person. My action may not be deemed as valiant or brave, more cowardly....trousers up, wash hands...run away. 

I am hoping that if someone is watching over me, I am not solely judged on my actions that day.

A word of warning, if this happens to you, get yourself checked out. Ignorance is not bliss...it is painful and smells kinda weird.",16,7,tifu
t3_kuclx3,TIFU by using a heating pad to heat up a glass mason jar filled with milk and hot cocoa.,"Since it wouldn‚Äôt fit in the microwave, I thought using a heating pad would be a great idea. Turns out, I couldn‚Äôt even come closer to being wrong. About 2 minutes in, I heard a snap. I didn‚Äôt think much of it, since the jar still LOOKED fine. One tap, though, everything just fell apart. IT WENT ABSOLUTELY EVERYWHERE. And it took forever to clean. I had to unhook the pad, throw the jar out, try and pry the bottom of it off of the heating pad since the burnt hot chocolate turned into a volcanic slime, and spend 30+ minutes cleaning the milk and hot cocoa mix that was literally everywhere EXCEPT in the jar. The worst part is that this all took place during the night, so I had to be gentle and quiet while dealing with it all to not wake anyone up, which made everything so much harder. Thankfully, there weren‚Äôt any glass shards, since it cut cleanly around the bottom, but still. It‚Äôs an experience that I‚Äôm both embarrassed about, and one that I‚Äôm sort of glad to have had, since now I know one big thing of what not to do in this situation. 



TL;DR - If you ever want to heat up milk with hot cocoa mix for some nice hot chocolate, use anything else but glass (maybe a small pot, which I feel dumb for not thinking of that at the time), because you could end up wasting a lot of milk and hot cocoa mix for no other reason other than you were being a dumbass.",15,5,tifu
t3_kuc17h,TIFU by going to the car wash,"So, I've had my car for a year and a half now but never washed it before today. I usually let the rain or snow rinse off whatever dirt gets on it. Today, I got tired of all the salt buildup on it and took it to the automatic car wash. I pull in, the sprayer arms start doing their thing, I'm sitting there watching the suds, when I look in the rearview mirror and see water POURING IN through the back windshield!

Turns out the old weather seal can't stand up to the pressure of the car wash, and I found out the hard way. And of course, I can't stop the car wash, so all I could do is sit and watch the water keep coming in. Back of the car and everything in it is soaked, and now tomorrow I have to find a way to get any leftover water out despite it being freezing outside... This is what I get for finally taking care of my vehicle, I guess.

TL;DR - Washed my car for the first time, back windshield leaked, car and its contents are now soaked

Edit: It's a 2003 CRV with 225K miles. It hasn't been a daily winter driver of mine until this season, and a real daily driver at all until this summer, so it hasn't gotten salty or otherwise dirty until this winter. And I do other PM on my car regularly, just didn't notice this one seal wouldn't stand up to direct high pressure.",44,46,tifu
t3_kubywu,TIFU by accidentally watching the first 10(ish) minutes of Star Wars Episode IX before I watched Episode VIII (Spoilers Alert)," 

So  I have been vaguely aware of this subreddit for a while now but I  generally don‚Äôt come here and I have never had reason to post here until  now. Normally I find the stories here either laughably fake or humble  brag type material so I avoid. Anyway here goes

So  a little backstory to this is that I have only seen up to Star wars  Episode VII thus far. The reason behind this is that I was in prison for  the past 3 years from late 2017 until this past Fall. I never had the  chance to see either of the next two movies before or during my  incarceration and therefore decided to take the opportunity now. I am  off work for a couple days and I just finished up Avengers:Endgame and   Spider Man:Far From Home. Until now I have been able to avoid any  spoilers which is no small fear in a prison environment where everyone  talks.I was able to see a portion of the middle of Star Wars while  locked up but it was not much just enough to see that Snoke was  involved. It should be noted that I did not remember the name of the  movie when I went to watch it earlier (just a few minutes ago in fact)  and this contributed to my mistake.

At  any rate I decide the next movies on my catch up list are the 2 newest  Star Wars films. Well I should have done more research because I did not  look at the dates of the films and judged the chronology based on the  titles (rookie mistake). So I figured The ‚ÄúLAST‚Äù Jedi would be the LAST  movie but that was obviously a huge error because I started Rise of  Skywalker instead. Now I know I should have noticed the episode number  at the very least but it is late and I was eager to start the movie so I  ignored most of the title on the file. Well I start the movie and  immediately the famous scroll starts explaining the story so far. I did  not recall any of the story it was referring to but I thought maybe I  forgot seeing as it was 3 years ago I saw episode VI.

Big  mistake continuing to watch! I see Kylo Ren mowing down a group of foes  and snatching a green object from a pedestal. Okay... I keep watching  an he is talking to someone now and that someone is... Palpatine wait  wtf?!? Now Ren says that he killed Snoke?!? Pause Movie‚Äî&gt;exit and  check files... Damn! I watched the first part of the wrong movie and  just spoiled a major plot detail!!

So  now I am going to watch The Last Jedi and try to forget what I heard  but knowing that I can‚Äôt. Well that it what I get for being careless.  Thanks to yall for reading this dumb story but I thought this would be  perfect for here.

TL;DR  I have  not seen the newest 2 Star Wars movies due to circumstances and I  started watching the 9th installment in the franchise before the 8th due  to a careless mistake. This resulted in an (so far) undetermined  magnitude of spoilers being revealed.",9,7,tifu
t3_kuapg0,TIFU by leaving my camera on,"Ok so, basically, my college roommate (f22) and I (f22) are very close. Neither of us really have homes to go to outside of college, and we both have decent jobs that we do during the summer and part-time during term that can be done from home and pay the rent, so we basically live together full time. This is great because I got to spend lockdown with my best friend. Except...we're not just friends any more. In May of last year, we started....canoodling, with each other. Due to the fact both of us thought we were straight until that precise moment, we're taking it very slowly, ad neither of us have told anyone. 

Anyway, we were both in a zoom tutorial at the end of last semester- it was a last minute study session and everyone was kinda stressed, so most people had their cameras off. While it was happening, my roommate started rubbing my back, in the way she does when she wants attention. I put my arms around her, and kissed her on the lips. She didn't reciprocate, and I started to panic that I'd misinterpreted her signal, and then I realised the camera was on. 

Luckily, the professor was relatively decent about it (he told us to pay attention, but not in a shouty way, and he called out one of the guys who was being gross and horny about it in the chat), but EVERYONE SAW- including friends of ours who had until that moment assumed we were friends. There was also a bi girl who had tried to date me pre-pandemic, who I'd told (truthfully, at the time!) that I was straight. 

Luckily, I can laugh about it now but it was an incredibly embarrassing moment and it took a long time until I could think about it without cringing.

On Thursday, not today sorry, I was running around chasing after a road crew and I screwed up the address so by the time I got there the work was already started and I couldn‚Äôt go pee like I wanted too. Not that I could, it would be beside the car with a beautiful view of a Vineyard behind me, so I quickly threw on my gear and went to the foreman. About 20 minutes later my supervisor showed up because one person I had worked with had dropped off my jacket at the office and I couldn‚Äôt make it in to the office to grab it. I asked my supervisor to bring it to me and if she could also drop off some extra time sheet books for me. Anyways I thought perfect now is my chance! I asked my supervisor to take over I run to my car and I throw my jacket and my time cards in as I do the urge to pee is strong so in one swift move and yes my door was open I dropped into a squat a powered pissed by my car. Now your thinking ‚Äúthat‚Äôs it?‚Äù No, well that morning I had my XL coffee from McCrap‚Äôs and a blended blueberry and pomegranate smoothie it had decided it was a good idea to make a quick crash course though my gut. Because the force of gravity and my lower half being at a perfect 90 angle my bowels went  

‚ÄúRELEASE THE KRAKEN!‚Äù 

Unable to stop it, I let it happen, because my car. It was gross and nothing but an old McDonald‚Äôs bag to wipe with. It was like one ply concrete. After I cleaned up as best as I could and I didn‚Äôt have any hand sanitizer, I pulled up my pants up and thought I had covered my poop like a kitty in a littler box and put my McDonald‚Äôs bag over it. Little did I know the horror that was moments away from unfolding. 

I went back to my supervisor swapped out said bye and she drove off, only she turned into the driveway that I had my bruised McDonald‚Äôs turd, she turned her car around and drove off. Thinking that was the end of it.

t3_kuafl1,TIFU by not know what hats were,"Obligatory this didn‚Äôt happen today, but two years ago. 

I was applying for a job, and during the interview, I was asked if I could wear many different hats.

Apparently this is a metaphor for being able to do many different tasks and adapting to new problems, but I had never heard this before and had no clue what it meant.

I thought the interviewer was getting more comfortable with me and was joking around asking if I could wear many hats because of some crazy hat day they must have at work and that the question was a joke to break the ice.

So I laughed and was like ‚Äúoh yeah I can wear hats.‚Äù 

The interviewer looked confused and didn‚Äôt match my joking mood so I realized something was wrong. They then probably saw that I then look frightened and confused and asked if I was flexible and good at adapting to changes. I answered yes and continued the interview.

TL;DR: I was asked if I could wear many hats and thought the question was literal.

t3_kuafk6,TIFU by locking my half-naked self out of my house for three hours,"I *was* planning on going for a walk. So, I grabbed my phone and my keys, headed for the door, grabbed a trash bag with my free hand, and exited the house. I dropped the trash bag on the trunk of the bag, went back to the door, clicked the little inside latch, and closed the door behind me. Then I tried to turn the keys around in my hand and found that I wasn't carrying them.

To explain how this happened, I must add that the phone has a carrying case with a little ring on it. I can slide my finger into the ring and thus carry the phone without worrying about dropping it.

The ring felt like my keychain.

Oops.

Fine. It's a nice day. I think I'll go for a walk. So, I did. That was the plan anyway. Half an hour into the walk, I realized I had no water. Then it occurred to me that it was a sunny day and perhaps I should put on the t-shirt that I usually carry with me when I'm out for a walk. Oops. No t-shirt... Fine, fine, fine. Oh, and I'm thirsty.

My wife was out of town. I was half an hour from home, on a hot day, with no water. I was an idiot.

I turned around, walked home, and wondered what to do. My wife was already on her way back ‚Äî she had debated for home before she found out I had locked myself out of the house ‚Äî and I needed somewhere to sit. I discovered that my garden she was unlocked. Great! It was getting chilly, so I entered the shed and waited. I got bored, so I listened to a podcast.

It occurred to me that one of the many, many boxes in the shed might contain clothes from our recent move. I found plenty of clothes, all of which belonged to my wife. The only items that fitted were a summer dress and a blanket. I chose the blanket.

I kept digging. I found pots, pans, and a horse-cock dildo which I had been meaning to send (as a gag gift) to a recently divorced friend. Yes, my wife knew. Yes, my wife was OK with it. Anyway, it was big, purple, and scary-looking. I did not put it on the back porch. I *did* put the pots and pans on the back porch.

That's when I realized that my neighbors and their friends were watching me go back and forth between the shed and the back porch. I was naked from the waist up, wearing Army gym shorts, and looking slightly grubby.

I checked the time. I realized I had been listening to podcasts in the shed for two hours. As I chatted with them, it became clear that their party had been going on for longer than that. That meant they were being confronted with a half-naked, hairy, slightly grubby-looking man who had suddenly sprung from a shed that they had no reason to believe contained a human being, let alone a half-naked, hairy, slightly grubby one.

Then my wife got home.

As a result I make up fake names, email addresses, and use Privacy app to generate cc numbers to ensure I don‚Äôt get charged unless I decide to keep the service. The random email was snarfthundercat**@****.com and my first name as Snarf and last name as Thundercat (yes I‚Äôm a child of the 80‚Äôs). So I had an issue with some of the channels I had ordered so I had to call customer care, not even thinking about the name. Then I got connected with someone from India who asked me to certify my email and such. Then it dawned on me the info I had put. So for the next 15 minutes this nice Indian woman referred to me as Mr. Thundercat or simply Snarf when she wanted to be informal. I really think the name was lost upon her though as she spoke to me without a chuckle, giggle or laugh. I myself must have raised my blood pressure by at least 20 points trying to suppress my laughter though. I could say I would never do this again, but Mr. Thundercat has such a nice ring to it.

Last night I took my normal dose of muscle relaxers for muscle spasms and they make 1 drink affect my body as if I had about 2-3. This allows me to get really drunk really fast but also sober up really quickly. I've been talking to a girl off and on for about a year now and the other day she sent me a special picture and things have been going good. I actually kinda really like this girl and really embarrassed myself. I drank a full glass of whiskey in two drinks so that's about 5 normal shots or about 11ish drinks on me. I decided to send her a message while absolutely shit faced. It wasn't offensive it was just way too much. I apologized for it but she's barely talked to me today and I feel like I really fucked it up. She was supposed to come over for dinner tonight but for other reasons I had to cancel (yay having shitty roommates who don't care about your plans) and hopefully she'll be coming over tomorrow night for dinner and a movie but idk now because of my stupidity. I just wish I could take it back or pretend it didn't happen. I know my best option if she's not really wanting to talk as we were or come over is to just wait and things will get better but I don't want to wait and maybe miss out on having some sort of relationship with her.

t3_ku972b,Tifu: I c**ped into my pants inside a crowded elevator,"I go to a school that‚Äôs located on top of a hill, we have one and a half hour break for lunch. There is a mall at the bottom of the hill. On the fateful day I had a massive craving for KFC, so I split from my friends and headed down the mall. 

Midway down, I felt this bubbling in my stomach, it came on quick like a violent current. Realising my time was limited, I visualised my route to the nearest toilet which is located at the food hall of the mall.

Breaking into a brief run, with utmost focus, I akwardly kept my body upright and tight for full control of my sphincter, eventually I  managed to lump myself along to the elevator located on the park entrance of the mall. 

This was during peak lunch hour, a huge crowd gathered in front of the three elevators, captivated by their smartphones slow to react. I budged myself into the first opening door to the annoyance of those  I bumped off. I apologised profusely whilst trying to hold in a likely wet fart.

I positioned myself in the corner of the carriage, my body still in motion making my need to shit even more pronounced. It was then I noticed the door kept opening and closing, some prick was trying to shover in. At this point despair and anxiety manifested as rolling beads of sweat drenching me, which further added to the urgency of the situation. ‚ÄúGet the fuck out‚Äù I blurted. I was too self absorbed to care about etiquette. The door finally closed. 

As the elevator moved from 4/f to G/f my sphincter has reached its limit. The raging torrent of fecal matter was going to breakthrough the gates no matter how hard I tried to hold it in. The first gush came out as a small squeak. Barely audible but potent to the nostrils. The two girls next to me covered their nose in tandem, and I felt the people behind me shuffling in discomfort. I closed my eyes denying myself of this reality whilst focusing desperately in contemplation of damage control options. 

My sixth sense tells me that all eyes are now staring at me, with disgust and hostility. They must have found out that the source of smell was stinky old me. It was at this moment my legs weakened, I relinquished control, my will too exhausted, I resigned myself to the cruel hands of fate. What followed was the most liberating and embarrassing moment of my life so far. With a sound reminiscent of an unhinged wooden door creaking under the storm in a wet and rainy day, I emptied my bowels into my pants. In no time the ungodly smell filled the elevator in my own moment of Auschwitz. The door finally opened and people scurried away in disgust, I opened my eyes gathered my tattered senses and continued my walk of shame to the toilet. 

I spent hours in the toilet, waited for the lunching crowd to disperse so that I can do my best to clean up which was itself a Sisyphean task. I used my lunch money to catch a cab home. Luckily the cabbie showed me empathy and laughed at my retelling of the story, with all the windows down and the chuckling of the cabbie, I went home worried about what to tell my parents on why I skipped school.

t3_ku93dp,TIFU by renting my car on Turo and was instantly transported into an episode of Shameless,"So we bought a new vehicle this summer and have not used the other car we had since I work from home and my wife stays home as well. I tried to sell it, but we're upside down. Whatever. 

Last week, I had this genius idea to put it up on Turo. If you don't know, Turo is an app where you can rent out your car. I figured that a few rentals a month would cover the car payment. 

I created a listing for the car in the app and got it registered, cleaned, and disinfected so it'd be ready in case I got a reservation. I made sure all of the paper work was in the car and our personal belongings were out. I filled up the gas tank. I thought I'd for sure get a great review if I had both phone type charger cables in the car. Damn I'm good, I thought of everything. 

Now, my wife was not on board for this. She didn't like the idea of strangers using our car. I figured since we don't use it or need it and that it's insured, the worst case scenario was manageable. 
We recently watched the Will Farrell/Mark Wahlberg movie The Other Guys and my wife seemed oddly fixated on the fact that someone would allow a homeless orgy in our car if we rented it out. 

On Thursday I got my first reservation and was stoked. 

Now, the red flags were numerous, but I ignored them unfortunately. 
The renter immediately contacted me and asked to move the reservation to an earlier time - from about 4 hours away to about 30 minutes away at 7:30pm. They also asked if I would deliver it. Being excited for the beginning of my new money making scheme, I agreed. 
I arranged for my son to follow me to deliver the car and we dropped it off with the lady who reserved it. She assured me that she would take care of the car and that she would just be driving around town. 
It wasn't in the nicest neighborhood, but this is Utah. The worst neighborhoods in Utah are still much nicer than where I grew up in NW Indiana. I don't judge. 

So, as my son and I began to drive home and joked about all the bad things that could happen, my wife calls and asks if I had seen the email from Turo. Obviously I had not checked my email while I was driving. She went on to tell me that Turo's verification team had sent an email saying that they had additional information that necessitated cancelling the trip to ensure my safety and the car's safety. This email came 10 minutes after the (revised) trip start time. 
I wrote them back and let them know that I had already transferred the car and asked if a needed to do anything. They replied not to worry. The guest was just going through a routine check and that my earnings would not be affected and that no action was required in my part. 

Fast forward to 3:30pm Friday. A knock on my door from a police officer. Great. Now I'd have to hear the dreaded ""I told you so"" from my wife. 

The officer asks if I own the car and proceeds to tell me that they arrested a wanted fugitive in it and I had to pick it up after they were done searching it. I've seen what they do to cars looking for drugs. It's not pretty. Once I got the call to go get it, the cop explained that nothing was broken, but few panels were removed. He ended the call by saying ""good luck, man"". I drove to the location where they left it, which oddly, was at the residence they picked the dude up which was a bit uncomfortable. 

Luckily there was no real damage. I was able to pop the panels back in easily. There were a few personal items in the car that were not mine - a hat, shoes, a bottle of something, some garbage, and a bunch of cigarettes. I left them in the parking lot as I just wanted to be done with this whole thing. 
I did notice that the gas tank was half empty and they had put over 400 miles on the car in under 20 hours. It also smelled like smoke. Annoying, but I used to smoke so whatever. It's over. 

Nope. 

I get home and call Turo to see what to do. There were still two days on the reservation. That was a nightmare. They transferred me back and forth between departments and chat and email after explaining that my car had been used to traffic drugs and the unapproved driver had been arrested. Towards the end of the call, all I wanted was to ensure that the renter could not see my address and info as I had no idea what was going on and who this wanted fugitive was. After two hours of this, someone finally assured me that the renter could not see my info. 

While I was on with Turo support, the lady who rented the car texted me and asked what was going on. I gave her a short version and she asked if I was bringing the car back. I declined. 
She then we went on a whole story about how someone she knows stole the car. 
And now she wants a refund. She put in for a change to the reservation for the one day. I accepted that. 
So now I got a whopping $31 for this which doesn't cover the gas missing from the car and the several trips I made to deliver the car and to recover the car. 
Now she wants me to bring her the personal belongings that I left there. I said no and told her where I left them. I asked her if we could be done at this point. 
This morning I look at the app as they're sending me emails to finalize the trip. So I fill out the form marking $20 for gas and $50 for smoke damage on the reimbursement section. 
Then I get a call from the police telling me to come back down there to pick up the insurance card, registration, and keys. 
So I go down there again and while I'm waiting for the officer to show up, she texts me again complaining about how I charged her an extra $80 and how she wants a refund. It's not her fault. I left her personal belongings in the road. Blah blah blah. 

The officer shows up and gives me my stuff. He then explains how the gentleman they arrested was the most wanted fugitive in the county. I asked if he just had a bag of weed or it was something more. The officer told me they found A LOT (while his eyes got huge) of drugs, pipes, weapons, and stuff in my car. I then asked if I need worry about needles still being in my car. His response was ""be careful"". 

I get home and try to work out with the lady her refund. We came to the agreement that I should be compensated $110. $30 for the day rental. $20 for the gas. $50 for the smoke. 
She said Turo would be contacting me about the refund. I reiterated to them via email that she should be refunded anything beyond my $110 compensation. 
They refunded her out of my $110 compensation. 

So now I get a whopping $46.44 for all of this because their support is so incredibly incompetent. 

To boot, they sent an email finalizing the trip with a nice map of where my house is. 
They also have no regard for the personal safety of their hosts. 

tl;dr
I rented my car on Turo and it was used to traffic drugs. Turo support sucks ass.

t3_ku8p5d,TIFU by forgetting about the 3/5s compromise,"Obligatory- this happened a couple weeks ago. Also on mobile so if there are any formatting errors I will try to fix them.

For those of you who aren't familiar, in short, the 3/5s compromise was a period in American history where the the South wanted their slaves to count as votes (despite not having the right to vote so essentially the slave owners would get a ton of votes). The North obviously didn't want this, so it was decided that each African American would count as 3/5 of a person for voting purposes.

Two things to know about me- 1. I am a very introverted person and 2. I am a white woman who is engaged to a Native American smartass.

Now, my fiance and I were in the kitchen and I was talking with my mom about being introverted. The conversation went as follows

Me: It's really tough for me to be around people because they are absolutely exhausting.

Fiance: *sad puppy dog eyes* you find me exhausting?

Me: You don't count as people (fellow introverts, I'm sure you'll understand!)

Fiance: No, just 3/5s right?

Me: Exactly.

You guys. I walked my ""the beacons are lit, Gondor calls for aid"" white ass right into it. It took me about 0.2 seconds to realize what I had just agreed to and immediately exclaim ""WAIT, NO, NO, NO!"" but this man was already cackling so hard he couldn't talk and I then had to explain to my very confused mother what had just happened.

TL;DR: I, a white woman, was explaining how being introverted affected me and inadvertently agreed to the premise that my minority fiance only counted as 3/5 of a person due to a brief memory lapse of American history.",94,6,tifu

On my second drive however, a thought occurred. I'd drank coffee that morning, and was drinking one from a flask. Coffee is a very strong laxative for me.

I was stood, in my neighbors drive as the feeling hit, it wasn't stopping, time to mkve. I began to run, not thinking about the ice, and ended up slipping in their drive. The shock from falling made me lose focus, and I let loose. It ended up coming up and out of my pants from the impact of hitting the ground, leaving a mess in the drive.

I waddled home and showered, before cleaning their drive and giving up. 

I have since received kind words from various neighbours, which is ridiculously embarrassing as I think they seen it happen. At least they'll know to clear their own drives now.

t3_ku7tii,TIFU Almost became a statistic of people drowned in the Kern River,"I went camping and river tubing to along the Kern River. The water was at most waste high in most places on the river. There are some rapids and small waterfalls along the way. I was river tubing and the river was leading to a waterfall that didn't look too bad, when suddenly the current took me in another direction towards some large boulders. Instead of going over the boulders, the water was being sucked down a crevice under the boulders.

The current pushed me in between the boulders and I got flipped off my inner tube. I was sandwiched between the boulders and my inner tube by the water. The current was so strong that it popped my inner tube and sucked it away into the boulders. Now, I was pinned against the boulders by the current of the river. I could barely move. The water was up to my neck and couldn't climb out. 

I was scared. I didn't know how long I could stand being pounded by the river with water rushing against my face. I made the decision to dive down and hopefully go through the same hole that took my inner tube. I dove down and felt my way to an opening. The current of the river shot me through the hole and out the other side. Good thing I decided to wear a life vest. After I made it out of the hole, the life vest pulled me back up to the surface of the river.

Thinking back on this incident, I'm not sure if I made the best decision. What if the opening at the bottom was too small for me to fit through? What if there was another boulder blocking the exit? The river current would have been too strong for me to get back out. I would have ended up as a +1 on the local sign in town that said. ""Kern River: 294 Lives lost since 1968.""

TLDR: I almost drowned tubing down the Kern River. Wear a life vest.",16,3,tifu
t3_ku7hup,TIFU by burning my eardrum,"Well this happened just a bit ago. My ears felt a little waxy so I decided to go get an ear cleaning kit from the pharmacy to flush them out. So I opened the kit and read the instructions and proceeded to follow them.

I started adding the drops of the solution into my ear, it said to do 10 drops. As I was doing it I thought ‚Äúhuh this burn a little more than I thought‚Äù and ‚Äúwow it‚Äôs really bubbly.‚Äù I then put the ear plug in like it said.

Suddenly, my ear felt like it was on fire, intense bubbling inside, a lot of pressure and pain. So I started reading the box to see if it said anything about it and then I saw it in tiny tiny text ‚Äúavoid using if you have tubes in ear‚Äù and then it hit me.

I had forgotten that I had a tube put in my ear a year or so ago (I had them as a kid too) and I didn‚Äôt think to check into it. So now I‚Äôm laying down with a bottom ball in my ear trying to drain any solution out. I can still hear by the way, so all good there at least.

t3_ku6hnz,TIFU by giving my toddler a metal cup,"I bought the cup last week but today my poor decision came home to roost. My son is 18 months old and not overly fond of bed time. He's also got this rotten little habit of stashing his sippy cups in weird places where they end up getting smooshed. 
I was out shopping at a store with a lot of camping stuff and stumbled on a sippy cup made of metal. It's yeti-style with a plastic screw on lid. Jackpot! If this thing gets stuck under the recliner, it's not going to explode when someone sits down. 

Cue today, half hour ago. It's late and the little guy just does not want to go to sleep. We rocked him, we snuggled him, we ended up giving him the sippy cup. A few minutes into a cozy cuddle and all of a sudden...

BAM!

He swung his cup and smacked me dead center of the bridge of my nose. Then the little poop machine starts crying because when I yelled ow, it scared the hell out of him. My nose isn't broken but it's definitely going to be swollen and it hurts like hell.

t3_ku6935,"TIFU By Getting Caught By My Father-In-Law With My Pants Down, Rubbing My Belly","This happened last week but I‚Äôm still mortified. 

My partner and I recently bought a house with some financial help from his parents. They‚Äôve dropped by unannounced a few times since we‚Äôve moved in, usually with some food or other goodies, so it‚Äôs not too much of an annoyance. 

Before I continue, I am painfully aware of how lucky/spoiled we are. 

Anyways, we have a half bath downstairs which faces our side door/main entrance. Since I am 9 months pregnant, that toilet is used by me pretty frequently during the day as I would not be able to make it upstairs in time with my overcrowded bladder.

Recently, as my belly grows large, I‚Äôve been leaving the door wide open so I feel I have a little more room to do my business. When I‚Äôm done, I like to look at my ever-changing body in the mirror, with my pants still at my ankles. One time while I was admiring my beautiful belly, I hear the side door jiggle and when I look up, I make eye contact with my father in law who is about to walk right in. Instead of closing the bathroom door and hiding like a normal person would have done, I hopped away and ran upstairs all while yelling at my partner to deal with his dad. I hid in my bedroom until he was long gone. My face is burning with heat just writing this.

t3_ku66s0,TIFU by rushing my Master Plan,"It‚Äôs all over. I‚Äôm ruined. This is the end.

I am warning you now: this is a tale of misfortune and woe- namely, mine. A cruel twist of fate that not even I could anticipate. This is the tale of my tragic downfall, and here are the characters.

**My parents:** Firm believers that Video Games can ruin a kid‚Äôs life. They are, of course, correct. The total ban on anything video game related is however still uncalled for.

**Me:** Sixteen year old criminal mastermind, IQ in the thousands. Very unlucky. Enjoys video games.

Clearly, these two parties are destined to clash from time to time. My dear parents are aware that I haven‚Äôt been too... obedient, but luckily, they are fairly lenient as long as I keep my grades up.

Me? I haven‚Äôt been obedient at all. The dumb shit I‚Äôve had to pull off to feed my urge to game deserves a reddit post all on its own. I‚Äôve rarely been *caught* gaming, but I am a terrible liar, and my parents know me pretty well. So our silent battle goes on- me finding ways onto the internet, and my parents catching on and stopping me. And thus begins my FU.

After some inspection of the family calendar, I realised that during the last two weeks of the Christmas holidays, I would be left alone at home for extended periods at a time, completely unsupervised. 

Perfect.

The problem is, my parents have a pretty foolproof way of making sure I don‚Äôt abuse their absence: lock every device capable of connecting to the internet in one room, and bring the key with them. I have of course been able to circumnavigate this problem in the past. I was determined to do so again. My determination, sadly, would be my weakness.

There are three possible places that the goods could be locked in: my parent‚Äôs room, my brother‚Äôs room, and my own bedroom. 

1. Getting in through the windows is out of the question- my parent‚Äôs windows are visible from the street and I don‚Äôt want to get arrested. My own bedroom needs a ladder to access, which I don‚Äôt have. My brother‚Äôs room, I *have* snuck into on occasion, but it‚Äôs annoying and time consuming since we have flyscreens and access requires two stools and me stealthily unlocking the window between my parents locking it and them collecting all the devices to lock inside the actual room. Also it makes me feel bad. Not a viable option.
2. Hiding in the room while they lock it no longer works. They‚Äôve learnt to check that I‚Äôm not inside first. THEY‚ÄôRE EVOLVING.
3. Hence, the only in way is through the door- the locked, non-openable doors.

But how would you get into the rooms? I‚Äôm glad you asked. 

There are three keys for each room, all of them on the same keyring. One of the keys will be labelled with which room they are for (keep note of this- it will, for lack of a better word, be key to the success of my plan). All the sets of keys are placed inside the same drawer, but my parents will of course bring the relevant keys with them as they leave.

Now, it‚Äôs only logical that one would inspect the labelled key to know which room it belongs to. Following this logic, that key would be the one which remains in the user‚Äôs hand and thus the one that is eventually used to lock/unlock the door. Thus, if any of the other keys are replaced, it probably wouldn‚Äôt be noticed. You can see where this is going.

Over the first four weeks of the holidays, I rushed to get all my work done so I could game without guilt. I also made a small container out of cotton balls and a plastic bag so I could handle the keys without them making noise. Within two weeks, I had switched one of the keys of each of the three rooms with one that opened the study: the one room that would never be locked, since I‚Äôm always there. Now, no matter what room the devices were locked in, I would have the keys I need to get them- hidden right under my parent‚Äôs noses. Genius. For a few days, it actually worked. My trickery remained undetected and my glee was almost uncontainable. 

Now, remember how I said I was a bit too determined? Remember how I‚Äôd finished all this in a fortnight? This left a big problem: there were two weeks left for things to go wrong. And go wrong they did.

Today, my parents had business to attend to, *separately*, and they would be home at different times. They of course needed access to their own room, so they SPLIT THE THREE KEYS TO THEIR ROOM. And by further bad luck, the labelled key went one way and the other two- one of which is an impostor- the other. Stupidly, I hadn‚Äôt realised that they would do this, even though I should have been able to see it coming. Of course, it didn‚Äôt take long for the swapped key to be used, and even less time for my parents to realise that all the sets had been similarly tampered with. Luckily, I‚Äôd been pretty productive lately (to get all my work done early, remember?) so they laughed it off instead of giving me a lecture. But they‚Äôre going to start taking the devices *with* them as they leave the house now.

That leaves me with two weeks without any work, any source of entertainment, and most importantly, no Youtube, no Reddit, and no League of Legends. All because I was a bit too fast and a bit too intelligent for my own good.

You guys have any ideas?

I didn't really think about sharing this one, but since I got a notification, that my throw away account has a cake day, I just couldn't miss the opportunity that I had so similar TIFU exactly a year ago!!

So during these COVID times, my friends and I just chat in the Discord pretty often. Yesterday was one of those days, and since I had just finished my first exam, it was time to celebrate. That meant that I brought my Vodka from the freezer and we started doing proper shots. Now, whenever I drink during discord calls, I get really loud. Not really sure why, but it just makes the call 10 times better if I can laugh with my full voice. My wife on the other hand is the best wife a man can ever have! When ever we have that kind of night with my friends, she's okay with falling asleep on the couch (since my pc is in the bedroom).

So there we are having our drinks and just chatting. I suddenly have a very good idea about turning our cameras on, since it would make drinking so much more fun! After a bit of time everybody agree and that's what we do. We had like 11 people in the call, with everybody's cameras on! It was so fun! After a while at one moment I took a toilet break, and then while sneaking through our living room, my wife suddenly said: ""No need to sneak, I'm not sleeping."" Its 4AM. She is really angry. I go right to her and start asking why she didn't tell me. Usually she falls asleep really quick, but this time it was much harder for her. She said that I was being too loud. I was very sorry and offered her that she can come to bed and I'll just call it a night with my friends. She said angrily, that she didn't care and that she will stay on the couch. Since my bladder was about to explode, I just ran to the toilet.

When I came back, I didn't see her on the couch anymore. She had gone to bed. I ran to our bedroom just to see that I had been disconnected from the Discord call. That meant that everybody saw her. I explained her the situation and called everybody back right away to ask how many of them had seen. The admin of our Discord server said that they reacted quickly and everybody didn't see. I disconnected and ran back to the bed to comfort my wife. But then she explained to me that it would've been one thing if she walked straight to the bed, but instead she walked right towards and then past the computer to turn off the light on my table. Everybody got an absolutely clear view. She didn't even think about that I have video on, since we do it so rarely with a webcam enabled.

So there I was... Crushed with shame and a proper hangover.
Today I took myself together and went back to their discord, they didn't mention the situation and everything seems to be going good. Its just the idea that ALL OF MY FRIENDS SAW MY WIFE NAKED, is what makes me feel soooo baaaaaad! So bad for my wife... She didn't even now...

And now the fact that it has exactly been a year from the last situation with Discord makes it even funnier. I hope you guys get a good laugh out of it.

I got two shirts, shorts, a dress, and a three pack of matching underwear and bra sets. They were normal colors and kind of lacy, so I was nervous about it. But they weren‚Äôt seethrough or super scandalous... so I thought lol.

I got the package today and I tried everything on in my room to make sure it all fit. I unpacked the underwear and they were completely seethrough, except the crotch area where you‚Äôd put a pad. But even that was tiny, it was the size of a post it. So they‚Äôre kind of ~scandalous~ but the bras are lined, so they‚Äôre not seethrough. 

Anyway, my mom came in and asked to see everything, and asked if everything fit. 

She got weird about the underwear. She didn‚Äôt take it or anything, which I thought she would. But she did scold me a bit and told me she‚Äôd have to shop with me from now on. 

I guess not a total fuck up, but it was kind of embarrassing to show my underwear in front of my family.

So I‚Äôm enjoying myself, doing my best to make him feel good and suddenly my husband jerks back and winces. I‚Äôm thinking that I accidentally got him with my teeth, but he looks concerned.

I was MORTIFIED. I just wanted the ground to open up and swallow me whole. I stood there in shock, eyes cartoonishly wide, staring at the ground. I mumbled an apology. Without missing a beat and with his normal high energy encouragement, he dismissed it and went straight back into the training session.

The next day I was talking about it to the guys at work. I asked if was possible that the trainer was oblivious to the fact I'd come so close to low fiving his hanging fruit. They asked if I felt anything. I hopefully said 'I touched cloth,' thinking I'd gotten away with it. They looked at each other, looked back at me, and simultaneously said 'He knew.'

Seriously I know this is probably going to offend a lot of Trump supporters, but really how can anyone actually support the man after all of this? He's no true leader if he actually has to have a swarm of cult-like followers storm the capitol building because he lost the election.

A real leader would've had everyone on the same page to begin with, without making anyone feel like they were sacrificing anyone's individual freedoms. He might have actually won the election if he hadn't tried to downplay a global pandemic, but that was just one of his many mistakes.

t3_ku41rs,TIFU By taking off my shoes on a plane,"Obligatory this didn't happen today.

Hark back to 2010. A fabulous year of living in a Charity's beach commune in rural Greece. The charity was helping protect/ rescue/ tag loggerhead turtles and their nests. For the five months I was there, shoes were rarely worn. We were staying in an olive grove and worked on a beach.

At the end of the project I had become accustomed to not wearing any footwear at all and when I made my way back to Athens I had to wear something on my feet again. I chose my thongs (flip-flops/ jangles/ sandels/ whatever you call them in your country).

As I made my way to the airport after trekking around Athens for a couple of weeks, while working in the charity rescue centre and doing a lot of sightseeing, the footwear broke. I didn't want to buy another set on the day I was flying out so decided to throw on the old runners (trainers/ sneakers/ tennis shoes/ whatever you call them in your country).

The shoes were really uncomfortable. They were cheap and I hadn't worn them in half a year. They had become dried out to the point of feeling sharp, rigid and uncomfortably stiff, and the material inside wasn't soft at all anymore. The lining on the heel cup had degraded and broken plastic was visible through the crumbling yellow foam.

I got to the airport, checked in, got through security, got to the gate and waited to board the plane. My feet were killing me. I could swear I had given myself open sores or blisters from the material rubbing on my heals because me being dumb, decided socks were for pussies and turns out I am a pussy because my feet were in a lot of pain.

When we got on the plane I was exhausted from partying in the hostel all week. I kicked off my shoes, using my feet to slide them under my seat, laid back with my eyes closed and had a gentle snooze. Finally I could relax.

Then I'm woken up by the staff rather franticly walking up and down the aisle. The plane was still on the tarmac and we were 10 minutes behind schedule. By this time we should have been in the air.

Not long afterwards they start to check the overhead bins. I ask someone what's happening as I couldn't understand the Greek. They reply that there's a weird smell and they believe there might be some sort of device on the plane.

""Device? Smell? The only smell I can get is... Oh no, my shoes!"" I thought to myself. 

I reached under my chair and grab my shoes. ""Quick, get them back on. I don't usually have smelly feet, ever! My feet never smell at all so why are they so bad now?"" I said to myself as I tried to be stealthy putting my stinky shoes back on.

These old shoes had started to stink as badly as any old rancid boot I'd smelt before. It must have been that they were cheap, old, and I didn't wear socks so my feet have been sweating in the seering Greek heat all day. I go to pull them on but my heals are weeping. I had cut them and now putting the shoes back on was agony. I couldn't go on like this.

I decided that I could engineer a fix by going to the toilet, washing my feet and using the hand towels (as they are stronger than toilet tissue) to line the heal of my shoe enough that would be comfortable so I could keep them on for the rest of the flight.

I made my way to the toilet with the shoes in my arms, pressed against my chest to conceal the smell. I get to the toilet door and thank goodness it's not occupied. Immediately an air stewardess approaches and puts her arm infront of the door and blocks me from going in.

""Sir, please take your seat.""

""I really need to go to the toilet.""

""Sir, we are still on the tarmac and we are performing a search on the plane. Please take your seat.""

I decided to lie in order to try and get permission to use the toilet despite them searching the plane. I thought if I pretended it was urgent she would make an exception and let me go.

""I..I have diarrhea, I really need to go now.""

""Sir, please go back to your seat. Try your best to hold it and we will be in the air soon and when the Captain switches off the seatbelt sign you can go.""

""I can't hold it, I need to go now.""

""Sir I won't ask you again...""

At this point two male air stewards approach.

""What's the problem here?"" One asks the stewardess.

""This gentleman is refusing to go back to his seat. He says he has diarrhea.""

""Sir, you have been asked to take your seat. If you don't follow staff instructions we will remove you from the plane.""

At this point I'm done. This isn't worth it. I'm going to go back to my seat and pull on the shoes and sort out the bleeding when the plane takes off. No worries, I can bare it for another 10 minutes or something.

""Ok, I'm sorry. I'll go back to my seat. I'm sorry to cause a problem.""

""Wait! What are you holding?""

""Oh, these are just my shoes.""

""Why aren't they on your feet?""

""My heals are bleeding so I took them off.""

""Why are you taking them to the toilet?""

""To pad the back where they are broken so I can put them on again and they won't make my feet bleed.""

""Pad them with what?""

""Wet hand towels.""

""That won't work. We can get you some bandages (plasters/ band aids/ whatever you call them in your country) from the first aid kit. Please put your shoes back on for now and we will bring them to your seat.""

As soon as I put the shoes down on the floor the air around us is rank with the smell they had thought was a device; they realised it was actually my smelly shoes and started laughing at me.

One of the air stewards followed me back to my seat with a couple of bandages and some wet wipes. He then announced to the plane that the (so far) 25 minute delay to take off had been caused by my stinky feet. I could feel the hate from all around as anyone who could see me stared daggers at me.

I cleaned my cuts, applied the bandages and put my shoes back on, all the while feeling very embarrassed, so stayed low in my chair as the Greeks talked about how much of an asshole I was.

A Greek woman next to me comforted her elderly mother who was crying because she thought that we might not take off in enough time to make their connecting flight. They both stared at me as though I was the devil.

Just when I thought the embarrassment couldn't get any worse, shortly after take off the female flight attendant came up to me and very loudly said
""I know that you have diarrhea so would you like to go to the toilet now?""

Tl;Dr: I took off my shoes on a plane and the smell caused an emergency false alarm which delayed takeoff while I pretended I had diarrhea and incurred the scorn of a plane full of angry Greek people.",46,13,tifu
t3_ku3p1r,TIFU by doing way too much edibles,"This was last night by I didn't have the mental capacity to type it so I'm doing now.

I normally don't do edibles very often but I recently decided to try them again. In the past when I would do edibles it was from a dealer not the dispensaries so the potency would almost never be correct. They would be advertised as 150mg but after experimentation would discover they were a lot lower. Felt like 30-50mg. So I assumed that these edibles would be likewise. That was my first mistake.

Not only that but these were kin slips. They go under your tongue and dissolve, taking effect in 10 minutes. Now that lead me to believe (for reasons I don't know) that it was a similar high to smoking, jumping up fast and leaving quickly. I was very wrong. Second mistake.

Also, I'm quite thin and have a low body fat percentage. Like 5-10%. Meaning I get high very easily. Not to mention I don't get high very often so my tolerance is almost always rock bottom. I started by taking one 10mg slip. After 10mins I felt a tiny bit high. After 20 mins almost nothing changed. So I took another. 20 mins past and again barely feeling anything and thought the dispensary ripped me off. Took another. And then another. And then one more.

I was going to take ANOTHER ONE but then I realized I was high out of my mind. It was roughly 45 mins after I had taken the first one at this point. My high continued to climb for another 3 hours. At my peak I couldn't form sentences properly, was stumbling all over the place and was even starting to hallucinate as objects started to zoom into my face. I took them intermittently between 7:30 and 9pm. At around 12am I was so fucking high i was starting to hear voices and my environment was moving around me. I went to bed at 2:30am, and was still absolutely baked. Woke up at 7:30am and was STILL high. Went back asleep until 11 and WAS STILL HIGH. The high didnt go away until 1pm the next day. 

TL;DR: Thought my edibles were a dud due to bad assumptions and got way too high.

t3_ku35dp,TIFU by doing my job well,"I've been a long time lurker here but I think I finally messed up and have to share it with someone. So. It happened this week when I had a meeting with my boss.

Background info here: I'm an introvert, like, for REAL. I'm really uncomfortable keeping in touch with friends and family, I tend to isolate frequently and I'm an overall mess when it comes to communication. I don't lack any social skills, but most of the time I just prefer not to interact.
Also, I'm a teacher, and my company/school is super open minded and modern when it comes to teaching; we're there to teach but also to create bonds with the students.

Of course, I've been overcompensating my lack of communication-energy while I work there. I know I have problems with it so I try extra hard to do my job the best way I can.

And I actually do it really well! And that's the problem!

I've recently had a meeting with my boss and found out they're opening a new branch/section to improve the internal processes through...better communication, teamwork and more personal relationships.
And I'll be fully involved in it.
Because as they say ""My strongest trait is how well I communicate/relate/bond with people"" (I even got a Christmas card reinforcing that today!).

It's quite the opposite. I'm screwed.

t3_ku2pil,TIFU by poisoning my own cup of tea,"First ever post on reddit, previously a serial scroller but I‚Äôm wired with nothing else to do so here we go.

For context I‚Äôm caffeine intolerant, so if I have caffeine I get all the usual effects but 1000 times stronger...

Tonight before bed I made one of those sleepy, knock you out for good, herbal teas. My housemate had actually been gifted a box of very fancy french tea bags. I picked one called ‚Äò1001 Nuits‚Äô, the last time I spoke french was in high school on my french speaking exam. Even then I‚Äôd hidden a cheat sheet in my calculator but I still trusted my language intuition enough to be sure this meant ‚Äò1001 Nights‚Äô, it actually smelt like rose and jasmine too which are usual suspects. So now I‚Äôm very excited to pass out with the power of 1001 nights worth of sleep so I brewed up and went to bed.

Now.. it‚Äôs 8 hours later I have the most intense headache, whilst being more awake than Flash Gordon on speed, plus the knowing dread that I have to deal with two blocked toilets in the morning. If tomorrow I mention being tired and some parent echoes in the distance ‚Äòtired? You don‚Äôt know the meaning of tired till you‚Äôve had kids‚Äô, I will take these bags from under my eyes and floor them.

But how could this have happened when I had the power of 1001 nights gently lulling me to sleep?

t3_ku21yj,TIFU by snapping at my girlfriend for complimenting me,"Ok, so, I've been seeing this girl for the past sixteen months. She's extremely pretty and skinny, which makes me feel insecure because I'm...not. I'm like 30lbs overweight, and much heavier than her. To be fair a lot of it is in my ass and boobs, but there's a lot in my belly as well.

Anyway, my girlfriend has never been judgemental of me, but some others have- I feel all puffy and clumsy when I'm with her. I'venever told her this, and I don't think we've ever discussed my weight. When we're flirting/complimenting each other/having pillow talk, however, she'll call me things like ""curvy"" and ""thicc"", and ""voluptuous"", or compliment my t&amp;a, or say how soft my body is. Usually I laugh this off but it makes me feel fat, even though I know it's meant nicely.

Anyway, today I couldn't fit in to my biggest pair of fat pants, AND had to cut my toenailed (never fun experience for an insecure fat girl), so I was feeling especially big. And then she (not knowing this context) told me ""if I was any more curvaceous there'd be two of me)

It was meant to be flirty banter. But I yelled at her for it. A lot. Until she started crying.

t3_ku1arm,TIFU by inhaling ants,"This happened a few years ago. I was traveling in Nepal with a group from my college. We were spending about 3 weeks helping out at a school there doing teaching, construction, agriculture stuff, and whatever else needed to be done. 

Public education in the area wasn‚Äôt very good so this school was considered a sort of tuition-free private school. In order to function, it ran largely on volunteers from both the surrounding area and from around the world. For volunteers who didn‚Äôt live in the area, there was a large, shared bunkhouse of sorts. The bunkhouse was made out of mud bricks and had two floors. It had windows but the windows didn‚Äôt have glass in them so rats, bugs, etc could be an issue sometimes. It was also just generally pretty grimy. 

The first day we get there, I pick a sleeping spot near one of the windows. I set all of my stuff down and unpack a little, including a small toiletry bag I use to hold my toothbrush and medications when I‚Äôm traveling. The windowsill is pretty wide and makes a good shelf so I set the toiletry bag down there. 

Fast forward to that evening. It‚Äôs about 3am and we had all been sitting and chatting around a campfire for most of the evening. I had a bad cold and had run out of tissues so I figured it was time to go to bed.  I went upstairs in the bunkhouse, grabbed my toiletry bag, and brought it back outside to a little external sink area to brush my teeth and do my meds. 

I have pretty bad asthma, so I take an inhaled corticosteroid twice a day. At this point I just do it on autopilot before brushing my teeth. 

I‚Äôm standing outside at the sink, wearing a headlamp so I can roughly see what I‚Äôm doing, and take my inhaler. As I breath in, I feel a couple small somethings fly into my mouth. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a huge deal because every so often, a little dirt will get in the inhaler. I decide to look anyway though and see that the mouthpiece of the inhaler is absolutely CRAWLING with ants. 

My sleep deprived, sick brain decides that I need to go to bed as soon as possible and instead of freaking out like I would have thought, I handle the situation surprisingly logically. I give a couple good coughs to make sure any ants are out of my lungs and gnash my teeth around a bit to make sure any ants in my mouth are good and dead. After rinsing with some water, I squished all the ants I could reach with my finger in the mouthpiece of the inhaler and rinsed that out too. I brushed my teeth, went to bed, and continued using the inhaler for the next month.  I stored my toiletry bag under like 5 layers for the rest of the trip and kept everything far away from the windowsill.

One of our shared interests was Motown music so anytime I was driving I had it playing in the car. One day we go out for lunch and she tells me she wants to break it off, of course she does this right after we order so now we‚Äôre stuck there for an uncomfortable amount of time. Of course I needs to drive her back home now (in traffic nearly an hour which is just great).

t3_ku0zrw,TIFU by drawing a swastika,"Disclaimer: Ok, I have been wondering for a few weeks now if I should post this, I even thought about doing it on an alt account because I don't know how people will react but fuck it I'm going hardcore. Keep in mind that I'm very against war, the Nazi movement, the holocaust and anything related to those.

This happened somewhere between 2009 and 2010, I was 9 back then, and I wasn't even a stupid kid, I was actually kinda smart but never had any interest in wars and I hadn't learned anything about WW2 in school so I knew nothing about nazis, Hitler or anything that happened.

I had just receive a laptop a year ago, it actually belonged to my mom but she didn't use it. Eventually I joined a forum where I met this girl, we started an online relationship which I regret today but as a kid with no maturity, being in a relationship was pretty tempting.

Anyway, she broke my heart in a messed up way. After we started dating, she suddenly disappeared for 2 months, one day I find out she came back and was dating a guy that was my friend on that same forum. Having no one to talk to about it I decided to just write it all on paper.

My parents were against me talking to strangers online so I didn't want them to see the letter, so I had to hide it.

I don't usually have posters on my room but at that time I had one poster about a Sonic game on my wall. I decided to hide the letter behind that poster. For some reason I was really good at turning a piece of paper into an envelope with some origami-trickery magic whatever.

So I made an envelope, put the letter inside it but the envelope was too simple so I decided to decorate it and stupid me realized ""you know what? This weird symbol (swastika) looks pretty sick"" so I drew it on the envelope.

A few weeks passed and one day my mom was cleaning my bedroom, she hit the poster and the envelope fell down.
My mom is the kind of parent that respects my privacy so she didn't open the letter.

Back then I was pretty relieved because she didn't read it, she would get so pissed off if she knew I was talking to strangers online, during my adolescence I never understood why my mom sometimes said she was scared of me until recently when it finally struck me, it was because she saw the envelope and she thought that I was some sort of neo Nazi or whatever, I kinda wish she had read the letter now.

TLDR: Stupid me as a kid wrote a letter about a girl I met online, my parents would kill me if they knew I talked to strangers online so I hid it inside an envelope and drew a swastika on it because I didn't know what it was and I just thought it looked cool, my mom found out and she didn't read the letter inside so she was scared of me during my adolescence.",17,13,tifu

It was a great night everyone was having a good time and enjoying themselves until a certain part in the night. I drank a lot of alcohol very quickly and I guess it all hit me at once. I'm a shy guy pretty quiet and keep to myself but all my friends are  open about pretty much everything. Hearing stories about some of the stuff they have done kinda shocked me I'm pretty close with my brother and friends but yeah it kinda shocked me a little bit.

The past couple of years of been having a problem within myself not thinking that I'm good enough or that I'm missing out in life because of how I act. I guess I just have an issue with comparing myself to people too much whether it's about relationships or work success etc.

I don't really remember what I exactly said but basically I sat down and told one of my best friends that I wanted to kill myself, no one will care if I'm gone, my life is meaningless and that I'm useless.

I've never opened up to any of my friends about this because it doesn't really come across in my mind that often. A few times last year I tried punching myself in the head to feel better and I got caught by my parents but within a few days I was fine and didn't worry about for months. Killing myself isn't something I think about regularly and I've never even attempted it but it's still not good that somewhere in my head it might come out sometimes.

I don't know what I triggered all those emotions my guess is that it was a mix of the alcohol and just hearing everything. As of right now I can't even look at an alcoholic drink without feeling sick in my stomach.

I fucked up and felt so bad because my friend that I told got upset and started crying and blaming himself and him and my brother want me know to see a therapist so that I can talk to someone who knows what they're doing. I don't really want to talk someone as I'm absolutely terrified of talking to someone and wouldn't even know where to start or even look for one but maybe it'll help.

t3_ktym0o,TIFU by not keeping my mouth shut at the dentist,"Several years ago I moved and had to find a new dentist. I had 4 cavities I‚Äôd been putting off for a while, so the dentist agreed to fill them all at once. The appointment was scheduled for 2 hours, later in the day, after work.

I normally snack on a granola bar every day at work. The store was out of my regular kind, so I‚Äôd bought some chocolate banana bars. They were DELICIOUS. I couldn‚Äôt help myself, and I ended up eating the entire box.

On my way to the dentist, my stomach was very unhappy. I was extremely bloated. The gas came quickly, and I spent the entire drive pushing out what I could, windows down, sweating. I was getting nervous as I parked, hoping it would stop. That‚Äôs when I read the box.

They were FIBER BARS.

But it was too late. The hygienist got me set up in the chair, put the nose piece on for the nitrous, and said she‚Äôd be right back. I took that as my final fart break and let loose. The smell was so bad I smelled it IMMEDIATELY, even with the nose piece on. The hygienist came back and did a full stop at the doorway before hesitantly proceeding.

Over the next two hours, I emitted a steady stream of toxic waste. I mean two straight hours of hot silent farts. The dentist seemed weirdly unbothered, but the hygienist excused herself several times. Towards the end, she told him ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I just... I can‚Äôt‚Äù and didn‚Äôt come back. He did the fillings while holding the suction hose himself for most of it.

I was so mortified that I didn‚Äôt go back there for over a year. When I finally did, I was hoping they‚Äôd forgotten. But as soon as I walked in, the hygienist (who also functions as a receptionist) knew my name. I figured she remembered me due to my horrific gas leak, so I apologized. Turns out she didn‚Äôt remember the incident, she remembered me because I drool like a Saint Bernard (this is true, it runs down my face, it gets everywhere). She laughed, I died a little inside.

I really like that dentist, so I decided to leave him a good review on Google. It basically summarized what happened and said they were very professional about it.

At my next visit, my dentist mentioned it immediately, laughing about it. He told me he has no sense of smell. He had no idea it even happened. The hygienist had blamed her leaving on a medical issue or something, and didn‚Äôt rat me out.

I should have just kept my mouth shut.

TLDR: Ate a whole box of fiber bars before a long dentist appointment, leaked hot farts the entire time, didn‚Äôt go back for a while, figured they remembered, turns out dentist didn‚Äôt even know and found out from my review.

t3_ktya93,TIFU By poisoning my family with green potatoes," So as if the cheesecake incident wasn't bad enough, I tried to make mashed potatoes last week and made both of my parents sick. For a little bit of background, I like to bake more than I like to cook, and I know more about baking than cooking.

So we had five potatoes that'd been in the kitchen for about ten or so days and I decided I'd use them to make mashed potatoes. I'd never made mashed potatoes from scratch before, but I knew what I needed so I thought it'd be great. So I cut them up and boil them, then comes the first set back. I can't find the masher. No big deal, I decided I'll chop them up more finely and use a hand whisk and fork to mix them with my butter and milk.

At this point my dad comes home and asks what I'm doing. I tell him and let him taste the potatoes (which I was still trying to mix at this point). He says they taste undercooked, so I decide okay no big deal, and pop them in the microwave for a while. This goes on until I've microwaved these potatoes for about ten minutes (I'd boiled them for about 40 minutes to begin with). By now they look good, and to me they taste edible to me. Admittedly they weren't great, but I figured it was just a lack of butter and salt (combined with the fact they'd been microwaved so much), so I add some more of each and I'm satisfied.

My parents both try the potatoes again and say the same thing, they smell and taste green. At this point I'm convinced they are not undercooked, so now I'm out five potatoes and about an hour and half over all. I ended up eating a scope of them myself (And I could taste what they meant about the green, though I couldn't smell it.) and throwing the rest away. I wish that'd been the end of it.

The rest of the night and next day both my parents feel sick to their stomach, are having slight diarrhea, and have headaches. I felt perfectly fine, and since I ate the most of the potatoes my first assumption wasn't the potatoes were to blame. Then I looked up if green potatoes were safe to eat... and lucky me they aren't. Apparently they have solanine, which can make people dangerously sick.

TL;DR: I made my parents sick with solanine and I guess my body just told it to fuck off since I've been perfectly fine.",42,10,tifu
t3_ktxy6k,TIFU by accidentally revealing too much about my sex life to my coworkers,"So I‚Äôm currently sitting in the bathroom and seriously considering quitting my job. I‚Äôm a nurse at a clinic and we just recently hired a new clinical lead. She wanted to hold a quick staff meeting with all of us to introduce herself, get to know us, etc. As per usual, we start off with an ice breaker where you introduce yourself and state a hidden talent.

Obviously this made me panic because I have no  real talents. I‚Äôm wracking my brain for something while everyone else goes and before I know it‚Äôs my turn and I have nothing to say. Everyone‚Äôs staring at me so I just nervous ramble and end up saying something along the lines of:
‚ÄúHi I‚Äôm u/kris6563 and I don‚Äôt really have any hidden talents. I mean I can put my whole fist in my mouth but I don‚Äôt think that counts.. uh I can put both my feet behind my head... that‚Äôs not really a good talent either but at least my last boyfriend thought it was cool... because.. uh.. he really liked gymnastics‚Äù 

The response was the expected silence with an awkward chuckle from some coworkers who really felt the second hand embarrassment. But basically now I‚Äôm too terrified to even show face in office and think I‚Äôm just going to call in sick for the rest of the day.

t3_ktxp9a,Tifu by throwing out her toothbrush for the second time,"TL;DR Been dating a girl on the regular, she stays over at my place with increased frequency,  I end up offending her by throwing her eclectic toothbrush away. I did it because of my past experience of moving too quickly into a relationship and moving in prematurely tends to be a relationship killer.  

Met this girl on Tinder in December and we hit it off instantly, she gets my pseudo intellectual ramblings about nothing, I enjoy her quick wit and attempts at being funny. We spent our first date driving to the country side, hanging out in nature, getting lost in conversation. Dating during the pandemic blues doesn‚Äôt leave much to do, I picked her up in my car and suggest that we spend our second date making a food painting of this album cover that we both liked. She was delighted, smitten even. We went off to the supermarket got our ingredients and head on back to my place. 

There we were designing the canvas, using a medley of fruits and melted chocolate as our paint. With our creative juices flowing, our bodies moving purposefully in close proximity with increasing intimacy, things got heated and passion envelops. 

The third and forth date flowed together and the notion of dates became redundant. She spent the rest of the weekend at my place. On Monday morning she went back to her place, an apartment shared between her and two friends. She told me she would be working at home the entire week, and so was I. 

I went in the toilet to freshen myself up for the day, and my eyes fixed its gaze on a new toothbrush nestled in a cup next to mine, my carefully rolled up toothpaste squeezed in the middle. A sense of dread came over me, crawling up my spine sending shivers down my body, I could hear the accelerated thumping of my heartbeat, as if struck by vertigo, sending me into a head spin, I had to sit down on the toilet seat, regulate my breathing to slowly gain back some composure. 

It was one of the Beast‚Äôs milder incarnation. 

I went through a rather amicable divorce last year, my ex wife and I remained friends. During one of our save the marriage discussions, I realized that I too often suffer from ‚Äúpassion overdrafts‚Äù. For pretty much every relationship I have had, we fall head over heels and things always progressed too quickly, before I realsied it I am already in a live In relationship. This pattern repeated itself too many times, and passion quickly fades into care and responsibility. The sudden appearance of a toothbrush with its own unique placeholder came to represent the beginning of the end for romance and passion. 

I threw the fucker away without second thought. I went to the store stocked up on some cheaper more disposable options. I mean dental health matters too despite my irrational fears. She didn‚Äôt notice anything about the toothbrush and she continued to sleep over 2-3 times a week.

We spent Christmas and New Years apart as she made plans to visit her parents back home. 
She came back on the eve of New Year‚Äôs Day, I must admit that I missed her over the holidays and couldn‚Äôt wait to see her again. As soon as our eyes met, we ran and greeted each other in a loving embrace, mask to mask. 

The night after, I had a few friends over for game night, we had lots of fun and my friends even dropped the you guys make a cute couple remark. Which we happily acknowledged. The night of inebriation and kush smoke rolled on till early dawn. I didn‚Äôt take to functioning with any awareness until late Sunday afternoon, and I saw an electric toothbrush next the basin. It left an impression on my mind but my hungover state debilitated me from taking any meangful action.

When Monday came round again, the eclectic toothbrush was still there, this time nestled in my Homer Simpson mug which belonged only to the kitchen. I didn‚Äôt quite get a panic attack this time, but I Instinctly threw it in the bin. We both had a busy week and I didn‚Äôt see her until Thursday night, I fell asleep quite early as I had a lot to deal with this week. 

So she left on Friday morning and I didn‚Äôt hear from her until today. I got a text from her this morning, asking why I threw her toothbrush away and that if I didn‚Äôt want her around I should just say so. At first I thought I would just play it off as an accident of sorts, soon realizing that she is no fool and that such a disingenuous answer may just dig me into a deeper hole. I told her it‚Äôs something we should talk about and although it seems counterintuitive but I did it because I do care about this thing that we are having.

I know its pretty indisputable that the asshole is me in this case, but do you think I can make things right? I will be meeting her tomorrow, despite the cold, she chose a coffee shop with outdoor seatings. I plan to tell her about my whole panic attack issue and why I threw out her toothbrush.

Sitting at the kitchen table eating lunch with my son (2.5) and daughter (4).  We all had sandwiches.  My son finished his and asked for another, and knowing he would take one bite and be done, I talked him into a bite of mine instead.  It was the same turkey, salami, and cheese sandwich he had except mine had mayonnaise. (Duke's, of course)

He started chewing and almost immediately mumbled through the bite that he didn't like it.  I proceeded to tell him he needed to finish the bite.  He tried to spit it out but I told him not to and he tried to continue chewing.

Well.... he legit didn't like it because he started gagging and proceeded to vomit on himself.

One bath later and all is well, but instead of me teaching him a lesson, it feels more like he taught me one.

TL;DR  Two year old son took a bite of my sandwich and didn't like it.  Told him he had to finish the bite and he threw up.

Edit: He asked for the same sandwich today, ate the whole thing, and again asked for another.  So......yeah, I made him another and he ate the whole thing.

We‚Äôve been playing this campaign since June and the previous session we just interrupted the BBEGs evil plan. Since we hit a nice lull, I told my DM offline that I wanted to try out a new character for a bit. The character was intended to be a tragically untrustworthy character who suffered from D.I.D. with the redeemable quality as a remarkable ranger. Well the overall effect came off poorly because as soon as my character was introduced I had to take a pause to hop on an online work meeting. When I came back 40 minutes later, the story had moved on, albeit in an innocuous way. I walked into the potion shop they had been talking in and felt inserted and out of place due to the time lapse.  It was a rough beginning and my previous character‚Äôs disappearance had been explained by going missing. He was kidnapped but no one in the party was privy to this knowledge. We set out to look for him with pretty much no clues to follow. ‚ÄúNot an issue‚Äù I thought. I‚Äôm a ranger. Well a few bad rolls later and we are hopelessly off track and I do not have the bearings I thought I did. This causes a huge argument in the party and the commander of the mercenary group we just started working for steps in. Well the party starts arguing with him and we all get fired on the spot. Now the party is mad at me.

This 2 hour interrogation video was recommended to me on youtube, and I watched all of it. I've never heard of this case before cause I was quite young when this incident took place, so I spiralled down into the rabbit hole.

I'm talking about the case of Travis Alexander. I read the whole wiki page, saw pictures, checked their myspace accounts, read comments, journals and found out how creepy this whole thing was.

The guy was literally commenting on her myspace pics and then he got murdered by her. This whole case really disturbed me, cause it almost feels cinematic, but it's not! This is real life we're talking about. I ended up feeling pretty bad about both of them.

t3_ktvw28,TIFU and my son is mad at me. TLDR at end.,"Shortly after Christmas my son called and told me he would be visiting in the new year.  Awesome.  He said he'd stay about a week, also awesome.  I love him dearly, and am just getting to know his new wife and I like her a lot.  It really is good to get to see them.  I must have misunderstood when they'd be arriving, because I wrote down the 6th or 7th.  I got a text on the 30th saying they were at the halfway point.  OMG whoopsie!  Okay, all well and good.  

We had an awesome week.  I was able to make most of his favorite meals, and even learned to make real tacos (not the old el paso junk) and enchiladas.   Thanks to his wife.  It was all good... until...

They were to leave on Thursday morning early, so we had to say our goodbye on Wednesday night.   On the way out I said something to the effect of ""this was great, but I don't want to see you for about 6 months "".  He asked why (of course) and I said that we (husband and i) needed at least that long to make a significant attempt at our diets.  He argued that we could have found recipes to satisfy both.  I tried to backpeddle but it wasn't enough.  I saw the hurt on his face and I'm sorry.

What I was thinking, and what he heard were 2 vastly different things. 

Way back at the beginning of quarantine I imagined that without seeing people I could ""emerge as a butterfly"".  Well, by Christmas I had gained a lot of weight.  I emerged as a slug.  

When I thought he would be here on the 6th, I thought that I would be a week into my diet and we would just make do with meals.  But when he arrived on the 31st, I... underscore I, decided to just postpone the start by a week.  

By saying that I didn't want him here for 6 months was just me trying to get on my diet without an excuse, not blaming him for a week of excessive eating.   I also mildly disapprove of the money he's wasting by coming all that way, staying at hotels, eating out.  I would so much rather he save his money.

To add insult to injury,  a few minutes after he left, I let out a little fart and said to my husband ""gee, that's the first fart in the living room in a week"" we laughed, but then he took my phone (he didn't have the right number on his) and texted the incident to my son.  No reply.  In hindsight, oof.   It must have sounded like we were glad he was gone.  I just don't know his wife well enough to feel comfortable with emitting bodily noises yet.

I hope he reads this.  I am so sorry for saying those insensitive words.  I love it when you visit.  You are never an imposition.   You've said often that you want to support my weight loss... even offered me cash per pound, offered to buy me one of those watch things that monitor everything... all I really need is time.  You are a wonderful son, husband, and person.  I am so proud of you, and I want you to be proud of me.

TL;DR made my son think that I don't want him to visit by saying that I didn't want to see him for 6 months.",8,7,tifu
t3_ktv5s1,TIFU- By eating a Caesar salad and going for a run,"

Obligatory- NOT today. I promised my kid I'd wait until he was at least 25 to tell this story. 

I was working super hard at changing my eating habits, and had recently discovered salad! I especially loved Wendy's salads, and I had just eaten a Cesar salad for dinner, when I decided to go up the street to the middle school track, and walk/run a few laps. 

The middle school recently had all the roads rerouted around it, and as a result, the back doors faced the main road. Right outside the back doors was a massive blacktop leading up to the track. They had 4 square and hop scotch areas, tetherball, and a basketball court. Because of the roads being ripped up and re-done, the new parking lot also faced the back doors, so I was able to drive up and park right in front of/on the basketball court.  

It was dusk and I had just completed my 2nd lap when my stomach started cramping and gurgling. I wasn't too concerned, because I had already learned that the healthier foods digest differently, often causing gas or bubbles in my tummy. I had felt that before and it always subsided without incident. 
Four laps made a mile, so I continued on, going for the mile. I was halfway through my 3rd lap, when things got serious. The ripping feeling across my bowels, and the incredibly loud sounds coming up from my stomach, were both insisting that I get to a toilet, FAST. I wait for the cramping to subside, and make a run for it. I was the furthest away from my car that I could have been. I bolt across the middle grassy area, and before I got halfway there, I had to stop and sit again, just in an effort to keep the poop in. There were NO toilets around. My stomach was RAGING. I wasn't gonna get another ""window"", I was gonna have to pinch my cheeks together and waddle-run to my car. 

I was feet away from my car when I knew: It was either shit my pants or squat where I was. I frantically yanked my pants down, and as I was trying to squat in front of my car (to hide from the main road), my stomach exploded. I shat on myself, my pants around my ankles, my own car hood, the license plate, and the basketball court. I was covered in sweat, shit and shame. I couldn't even understand what just happened. I grabbed some garbage from my back seat, placed it on the driver seat, and drove home. 

I took a scalding shower, got dressed and went outside to clean the poop off my car hood. My son comes out, curious why I'm dumping hot water on the license plate, so I told him. He laughed so hard, that I put him up for adoption (no takers). I realized that I couldn't just leave the poop at the school, so I filled jugs with hot water, grabbed a scrubber and my recently orphaned child, and went to the school to clean up my mess. I left my car lights on so I could make sure I got it all, and when I pulled up, it looked like someone had died there. It was an odd, almost reddish color, and after the 3 gallons of hot water and bleach, it was clear: I left a 3 foot tall, 4 foot wide shit stain on the basketball court. My son was horrified. ""MOM I GO TO SCHOOL HERE!"" Now it was my turn to laugh hysterically, which I did, as my 12 year old son looked traumatized.
I found out the next day, that Cesar salad dressing has anchovy paste in it, which can cause explosive shits in just about anyone. Don't care. I still eat it. 

For the next two years, the stain VERY SLOWLY faded. Everytime my kid went outside for recess, he would see the stain, and die of embarassment (even though we were the only ones who knew). It was super useful- Anytime my kid got mouthy, I'd just threaten to tell his friends about the stain. He rejoiced when it was time for him to move onto the high school. 

3 years after, the whole blacktop was ripped up and replaced, along with the school and track. I stuck with my diet, and lost 140 pounds. The stain is gone, and so is my fupa- but the memory lives on, and the mystery probably does too- because the stain was noticed. By many.

TL;DR- Salad made me shit on my car, myself and all over the basketball court at my Son's middle school.

t3_kttjlf,TIFU by taking a hot bath on day 5/6 of a 7-day fast,"Like a lot of people in the West, I (21F) gained quite a bit of weight in quarantine. I had had an active job before and suddenly switched to a sedentary one, and I was quite averse to exercising in my house, so I put on 15-20 pounds over the course of 2020. Call it the COVID 19, if you will. It got to the point that my period was over two weeks late. There was no chance I could be pregnant (b/c virgin with no boyfriend), so this was a *massive* red flag.

So on the spur of the moment on Sunday (today is Saturday), I decided to fast for a week. Fasting for a day usually got me over delayed periods, and it worked this time too. I finally got my period on day 4 (yay!), and, surprisingly, it wasn't painful at all. 

Everything went well until day 6 (really 5.5 because I started it Sunday afternoon), when I was about to take a shower and my mom suggested I take a bath instead. I ran a hot bath and stayed in for about 20 minutes, then stood up to rinse off under a cold shower (you know, to get all the bath crud off). 

As soon as I stood up, I started feeling woozy. Standing under the cold shower improved it, but when I turned off the water, things rapidly got worse: heart racing, short of breath, ears buzzing, vision fading, swaying, the whole nine yards.

*[Narrator: That was when she knew... she screwed up.]*

 I tried to towel off but things were getting dire, so I just pulled my bathrobe halfway on, stumble-ran out of the bathroom, and flopped onto my bed. I managed to retain consciousness but lay there with my eyes shut and waited for my system to return to normal... and, of course, formulated the title for this Reddit post. After about five minutes, I was in good enough condition to get back up and retrieve the rest of my stuff from the bathroom.

I had to be cautious about this since as you can also see on my profile im a pretty avid hentai poster. So, I hid all of my posts. My understanding of hiding posts is that you still keep you karma and the posts still show up on subreddit results but they wont appear when someone looks at your profile.

So I put the popcorn in set the timer and waited. When the popcorn was ready I took it out and it seemed like it wasn't quite ready because there wasn't much popcorn in the bag so I put it back for around a minute.

When I took it out again a lot of smoke came out of microwave. I burnt the popcorn. Remember when I said we live in quite small house? There was so much smoke that it was very hard to breathe even for me (I am healthy and don't have problems with breathing). 

So the smoke got to the other room where my dad was and he couldn't breathe. I had to open all the windows in my house so my dad could get to some fresh air.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm enjoying my morning coffee and smoke after waking up, looking forward to a day of doing nothing at all, the sun is beautiful through my window. I go to the kitchen (i live in a very small studio, but it's divided into kitchen, office and bedroom) and on my way back see this little white maggot crawling on the floor.

&amp;#x200B;

Disgusting enough, right? I try to understand what I'm seeing with my slow-still-not-caffeinated-enough brain when i look over to my window and on the floor beneath it there are HUNDREDS OF THOSES CREEP CRAWLING WHITE MOTHERFUCKERS. I really mean hundreds, by the way.

&amp;#x200B;

I panic for a few seconds, because that's a scene from a nightmare to me, and don't have a fucking clue where they are coming from, what are they, if they are dangerous at all... So I do what any reasonable and methodic person would to in this situation and start to pound the shit out of those maggots with my flip flops.

&amp;#x200B;

Now... Just a clarification, my house is actually pretty clean, i keep it tidy, but saturday is usually the dirtiest day since I don't really have much time or energy to do much in that regard in the weekdays. It's definitively not the kind of home you'd expect to find maggots in. That will be important in a few lines.

&amp;#x200B;

So I beat the shit of of those MF for maybe half and hour, and they keep coming. They are heavily concentrated under my window, but some isolated ones are everywhere. BUT. THEY. KEEP. COMING! So the coffee kicks in and I start to be smart, and look for the source of those fuckers.

&amp;#x200B;

I look into the cat litter... Nothing. I look into the food bowl. Nothing. I look into the bathroom. Not a single one there. I open the trash can in the kitchen... BINGO!! There they are! So, again like a very moderate and methodic person, I wrap the whole can in a bag and throw that shit away. If I could I would burn it.

&amp;#x200B;

After getting rid of the source, their numbers dwindled. My final blow was looking into my cleaning products for the strongest thing there, found a glowing greeen desinfectant (not an overstatement, that shit cannot be safe to use) and mopped the floor franticaly with that in the hopes of killing every single living thing on the floor.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, with a calmer mind, I looked them up and they are actually house fly maggots, and they are not dangerous. I cleaned every inch of my studio and thing seem to be spotless now, but i still ocasionally take a lap around the house to look for them.

&amp;#x200B;

My mistake was simply not taking out the trash. I usually just take out the trash whan the can is full, but for some reason I spent this week without filling the can, so I didn't bother. And oh my, I really regret it. That's all folks, remember that when your mother told you to take the trash every day, she was right.

TL;DR - Woke up to a house full of maggots because I forgot to take out the trash for a week.",2,0,tifu
t3_ktr64b,TIFU by accidentally drowning my just-shaved pubic area in vinegar,"So I've been having a bit of a dandruff in my hair (that on my head, that is) and an itchy scalp. Recently I read that rinsing your hair with vinegar can help with that. So I thought, why not try it, it's cheap and even if it doesn't help it won't hurt, I can always try.

&amp;#x200B;

So I hop under the shower with a bottle of vinegar. Then before I reach for my shampoo, I realise it's also time to do my normal maintenance on my *other* hair - that Down Under - so first I grab the razor and shave my pubes.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, after washing my (head) hair, as normally, with shampoo, I pour the vinegar over my head/hair, let it soak in a little, then rinse it out.

&amp;#x200B;

I realise my mistake when the vinegar hits my freshly-shaven pubic area, which is ON FIRE now (no not in a good way; I mean literally and in a very painful way).

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily, it rinses away quickly, but I'll never shave anywhere on my body on the same day I use vinegar on my body again.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. The vinegar did seem to work well on my hair, which feels all fresh (I rinsed the vinegar out well of course so my hair wouldn't smell bad) and shiny, but I still have the dandruff. I'll have to try it a bit longer to see if it helps.

t3_ktr4lo,Tifu by throwing a ball at my daughters eye,"This happened a month ago. My daughter was outside riding her bike and I was playing fetch with our dog. This is a typical evening on our street. I got a chuck-it wand to run our dog once I got tired of the slobbery mess of a ball I was throwing with my bare hands. So I was playing fetch and one of the throws I tried to bounce the ball really high and I threw it as hard as I could towards the ground. This is we‚Äôre i fucked up. 
Instead of bouncing, it went straight and it went straight into my daughters left eye. She was about 50-60 feet away. My daughter is 6 and I have never heard a thud and wail in my entire life. I ran over to her to check on her as she‚Äôs just absolutely balling. I have never been so worried about my kids before in my life. I thought I broke her eye socket, made her go blind, gave her a concussion. I mean I was worried. She didn‚Äôt cry fo r that long and I was finally able to see her eye and have her tell me what hurts. Once she opened her eye I saw the bottom of her iris completely bloodshot. She was saying she can‚Äôt see anything. Now I‚Äôm panicking even more thinking I just made my
Kid go blind. I call the wife and tell her what‚Äôs going on. We ended up going to see a ophiologist and of course only one can go in and it was my wife since I had to park the car. So I‚Äôm waiting at the door for updates and just rethinking the event over and over. Cell service sucked so I barely got updates. But after 5 hours, multiple tests &amp; ct scan they come out. 
Ct scan was fine so no concussion. They gave her steroid and glaucoma eye drops. We were to see an eye doctor in the morning. First visit he said her eye pressure is really really high and he can‚Äôt see in the back of the eye to tell if there‚Äôs damage because of all the blood. So do the eye drops and come back in a few days. Well each visit the pressure went down but the vision was still blurry. So our 4th visit, last week her vision started becoming clear and he could see her eye. No permanent eye damage!!!!! Man I was so relieved. I felt like I could finally breathe and be somewhat ok with what happened. Yesterday we got the final all clear from the doctor and one more visit in 2 months. I was a wreck the past few weeks and couldn‚Äôt help but think of the worst of course but I and my wife are so thankful that her vision is not compromised. 

TL;DR played fetch with my dog, threw the ball at my daughters eye. Thought she went blind but three weeks later her vision was back to perfect. I was able to breathe after that.",12,1,tifu
t3_ktr2g4,"TIFU Wearing boxers instead of briefs, and probably more","**TL;DR: Had a great time with a girl, but wore boxers instead of briefs. Proceeded to obsessively think about it which may have led to her leaving and i sprained my ankle trying to fix the situation. I may have fucked up even more.**

Obligatory not a 'today I fucked up', fortunately for me, this happened last year, so I have had *plenty* of time to process it in the middle of night while pondering my existence. I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry about this situation anymore‚Äî or both‚Äî but certain mates of mine all had uncontrollable gags upon hearing my mishappening. Certainly glad my suffering was to their amusement. 

Let me give you all a rundown first:

During my uni days, I met this girl who i thought was really cute. But i'm a pretty chill guy so i never try to imply anything to anyone unless i know them for a while. We met up a couple times with her friend but never alone. Then one time i needed to give her some study material but she kept insisting that she was hungry so I suggested that we meet up for lunch. I didn't want to make her assume i thought it was a date or anything so my big brain mobilized and suggested we can have a quick bite of pizza before i head off to university to study. So we met up and the conversation was just flowing uncontrollably. We chatted about every topic off the surface of the earth. It was like opening one Pandoras box after the other and forgetting to close the doors behind, we were just completely in sync. We sat there eating pizza for 5 hours not even realizing the time passing. So far so good right? But like everything in my life so far, god just loves to play with me i guess like his little play thing he wiggles..

Anyway we drive back and she asked about my place, so I showed her around all the rooms and then showed her my room. My housemates seemed to be out of the home and it was just us now in my bedroom. Now i know what you might be thinking, smirkybois. But oh boi you be wrong bud. she just sat in the other corner with the chair while i sat in the bed. Not knowing what to make of it all and trying to not imply anything I just started having a small chat with her since she just kept sitting there not moving. She always seemed a bit naive to me about implications based on our conversations so i had no idea how to process it.

This is where the fuck up starts, I was wearing boxers, i never wear boxers its always briefs like a king. Whenever i wore boxers back then i feel like there is a hole in my pants due to its superior aerodynamics. I just could not get over this idea as it itched inside my mind. So i proceeded to just stare at my junk, menacingly trying to figure out if there was a hole. But alas no hole....But i lost track of a bit of time as i was processing the lack of hole yet airflow situation. Then I just looked up and stared at her, she just stared back and just immediately got up and started talking about how she had to go and quickly ran downstairs onto the car. I was so utterly confused in that moment i just walked after her. She said she should go and thanked me for my time and legged it.

For the next 10 minutes my mind was overclocking like Charlie from r/IASIP trying to piece together the missing puzzle pieces to Pepe Silvia. What just happened. Then it hit me, like a rock thrown against my face giving me the biggest adrenaline shock of my life. She must have insinuated something which made her uncomfy, I thought. So I just started rushing upstairs trying to get to the phone to explain myself when I tripped against the 2nd set of stair causing my ankle to jerk to the right and sprain then and there. The adrenaline was too much for it however so I kept walking up with my wobbly ankle dragging it against the carpet. I get to my room and blanked into the nothingness just thinking about it all and decided to call my friend....who honestly did little to help since they were too busy laughing about the whole situation. 


I called her 10 times to explain but she did not respond a single time which made me even more concerned. But then the weirdest message followed, she just messaged that ""she had a great time and could not message as she was driving and sorry for taking my study time"". Like what? So I called her up and in my head I had a very rational argument laid out that I was going to outline to her. As I was approaching the topic I realised nope I have no fucking idea how to say this so I looped 'so um..you know uhh' for a solid 30-50x and she just tried to move the conversation failing each time. Then she just said she had a good time and it was fun and i just ended the call there. The next few days i could not get over that whole situation and how dumb i was....Now I thought she was a bit clueless about all this interactions and meaning based on past conversations but maybe the biggest fuck up was that i had no clue what she was after that night and maybe i fucked up in more ways than i realise. Maybe I was the one that had no idea. Honestly, it was never the same after that, we met up once or twice after but i just could not get over that fuck up which meant that I would never meet her again in person even though she messaged about meeting up. She now has a partner, who is not me so :) yay go me.",9,5,tifu
t3_ktqnde,TIFU by asking for TP in a gas station bathroom.,"I still can‚Äôt believe I was such an idiot. Obligatory this is on mobile so apologies for formatting. 

Backstory: My boyfriend is moving so we‚Äôre road-tripping to his new apartment today. When you gotta go you gotta go, so we exit and and stop at this random gas station. 

I rush inside because of course I waited too long before informing my bf that I was in need of a tinkle. I open the door to the bathroom and immediately smash it into this poor child who was standing right in front of the door. Oof. Not a good way to start out my bathroom break. I should have known worse things were coming. 

Another child is in the first stall (I can tell by their tiny feet under the door) so after apologizing profusely to the mother of the child I schmacked, I rush to the open stall. Sweet relief. I‚Äôve been eating junk food all day, so I also take a respectable dump after my tinkle. THEN. HORROR.

THERE‚ÄôS NO TOILET PAPER IN THE DISPENSER. 

I can‚Äôt believe I was in such a rush that I didn‚Äôt check to make sure there was toilet paper. I sit on the toilet for an indeterminate amount of time considering my options. Unfortunately, the TP rolls offered in this bathroom are the big industrial kind so the cardboard is way too solid to be torn up and used as a last resort wipe. I took a junk food dump so it‚Äôs not like I have the option to pull up my pants and live through a little dampness.

Option number three: A mom and her kid walked into the bathroom so maybe I can ask them to toss me some paper towels? Thankfully this was a different mom and child from the one I door smashed when I first walked into the bathroom. (Usually option number three would be asking the person in the stall next to you for TP but since it was a little kid I decided to negotiate with the adult in the room.) 

I close my eyes and wish myself luck and hope that I don‚Äôt die of embarrassment in the next few moments... ‚ÄúExcuse me, ma‚Äôam, there‚Äôs no toilet paper in here. Can you pass me some paper towels? I‚Äôm in the last stall!‚Äù 

The lady says back ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, there‚Äôs no paper towels out here.‚Äù AND THEN, the probably around 8 year old girl in the first stall says ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no toilet paper in here either!‚Äù Because this random mom is a queen she assures us that she‚Äôll go talk to the person at the counter. The employee comes in, throws a roll to the girl in the first stall and throws a roll to me. 

VICTORY! I get to wipe! YAY! I finish my business, turn around to put the TP roll on the back of the toilet... and my heart stops. I ask the good Lord why he let somebody as idiotic and imbecilic as me to be born, and I lay the roll of TP that the gas station employee got me... on top of the full extra roll of TP that had been in the stall since the beginning of this ENTIRE ordeal. 

I leave my bathroom stall with shame in my heart and apologize to the employee and the mom who got the employee. I wash my hands as fast as I can, run STRAIGHT to the car without buying anything like I originally planned to, and decided that I really FU today so reddit deserves to have an indelible record of my shame...

TL;DR: Went to the bathroom, realized there was no TP in my stall, mustered the courage to ask for somebody to get something to wipe my bum with. There‚Äôs absolutely NOTHING in this bathroom for bum wiping so an employee is summoned to bring extra TP. After receiving the extra roll, come to the horrifying realization that there had been a roll of TP behind me the entire time.",4,5,tifu

There is a ranking system and in order to get to second year you need to have at least 45 points. About a week ago I saw a ‚Äúdeadline in less than 6 days‚Äù above every program. And I was at just 12 points! So I spent each day of past week solving at least 12 programs. The reason I am posting this here is because today I went an extra mile and spent 11 hours programming because deadline is in 1 and a half days. After I realised I was too tired to continue I checked the ranking and I was at 32.76 points. The problem is, I solved about 93 % of programs and the rest don‚Äôt give a lot of points. So there is no way all programs add up to 45. I made some research, and do you know what I found? THAT THE DEADLINE I SAW WAS FOR FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. I completely forgot that there was going to be another half a year after 12th of January, which means that my whole effort was basically useless since there are about 100 more points, probably at least 20 of which from my experience are going to be basic programs we are going to see solution for on the lessons.

While I was home in quarantine, I was making some lunch for myself using a roast chicken in the fridge. Not knowing how long the chicken was in there and fearing the worst I smelled it... nothing finding that strange I smelled it again still nothing... so the only logical thing to do was eat it. So I did... all week... and because I also couldnt taste well it tasted fine! 

However, all week I steam pressed my Calvin's like nooooo other! My girlfriend was also in quarantine with me nearly suffocated on night after coming to bed with me after I had been sleeping for an hour.

t3_ktq1c3,"TIFU by fcking up x00000 times in my life, every time I have interacted with my gran","So, a bit of background: I am completely accent deaf. I have such an inability to tell accents apart, people think I'm trolling them. For non-uk people this may not make too much sense, but I used to work in a phone job where I regularly spoke to people from Birmingham and Wales, and I could not tell the accents apart, they always assumed i would know who I was speaking to because of the accents but nope, not even the slightest clue. I can't hear the difference between American and English. Sometimes I can tell if I hear them together, but I can only really tell they're different not which is which.

So today, my husband and I were talking about my (scottish) grandmother, the conversation then moved to him saying something along the lines of
""Have you ever noticed how older people don't lose the accents of their birthplace as much as younger people seem to?"" I looked at him confused, we were just talking about my gran who sounds as English as I do ""but my gran doesn't sound Scottish anymore"" and he just.. gave me this look.. and then burst out laughing ""you can tell she is Scottish by the first syllable of her speaking"". 

I am almost 28. I have heard my gran speak for 28 years and always just thought she'd lost her accent because she's lived in England so long. If I didnt know she was Scottish, I never would have known because, to me, she had so little of an accent. 

But turns out she is very very Scottish and my accent deafness is even worse than I thought. 

Now when people talk on TV, my husband keeps telling me everyone is Scottish and I genuinely don't know when he is joking or not üòÇ

Its hilarious, really, that I am so accent deaf when my husband is a voice actor. Well...hilarious for me. Endlessly unhelpful for him hahaha.

t3_ktpvhe,TIFU by almost killing my cat (but stupid dog was fooled instead) and ruining a load of laundry,"So, today I was pretty busy multitasking, doing some work stuff, doing housework and helping my boyfriend out. Most of the housework I do on rote because I am so familiar with it, it is pretty much on autopilot. So to set the scene, in our laundry, we have two containers from Kmart that look pretty similar, one for cat food and one for laundry powder. I needed to do a load of laundry and also feed the cat at the same time, I‚Äôm pretty sure you can see where this is headed. 
Yep, I did it, I put the cat food in the laundry powder slot, slammed it shut and put it on the required setting, didn‚Äôt even think twice. 
Then I put a scoop of laundry powder in the cat food bowl, which is also in the laundry and then mentally ticked the boxes in my head, job complete. I vaguely remember the cat sauntering past the cat food bowl, with the dog looking with hope for cat food treats a couple of metres away. The washing machine cycle, thank god, only lasts for 45 mins, and when it is complete it sings a tune like it is singing an opera for about 15 minutes, which means it gets emptied pretty quickly. So, I go to get the washing out of the machine, and it is covered in brown goop. I‚Äôm scratching my head trying to figure it out, when my dog, runs past the door, with foam coming out of her mouth. I grab her and freak out and let my vet know that I am coming in with an emergency case. I get there, they ask me a few questions, but the main one is, has she consumed any surfactants? I have no idea, until I‚Äôve thought through my day, and realise that they mean laundry powder. 

End of the story is all the clothes I‚Äôve washed with the cat food have to be thrown out, asshole cat has walked away from the washing powder in her food bowl and has let the dog eat it, like the big dog idiot that she is. The dog was completely fine, but it‚Äôs lucky that she is a pretty lady, because she is not that bright. The cat is still currently acting like a smug bastard and the washing machine isn‚Äôt worse for wear.

Anyway, I live with a roommate in one house. We‚Äôre pretty close and we often just walk into each other‚Äôs rooms for a chat or a beer. Which is awesome. The only obvious downside of all that is that it can be hard to get some privacy sometimes. Of course we do the whole sock on the doorknob thing when we‚Äôre with someone, but if you just want to ‚Äúbe with yourself‚Äù for a while, the only safe option is the shower. 

Today I woke up, drank my coffee, ate my breakfast, and got horny. You know, the usual routine. I always ‚Äúdo my thing‚Äù in the shower for privacy reasons. And sometimes I watch porn on my phone during. But almost always without sound so no one can hear me. 

BUT since I had a pretty good month in December, I decided to treat myself to a brand-spanking new set of way too expensive Apple AirPods. I hike a lot, so I figured these would be nice to have for music or podcasts while I walk around. And I was right, they‚Äôre awesome! But while they are great for said music or podcasts. They also work great if you want to watch porn (with sound) in the bathroom before you shower, and you don‚Äôt want your roommate to hear.

The shower was nice. Just like it always is. But, I don‚Äôt know, the running water just sounded different. A bit muffled or something. Kinda weird? ‚ÄúWhatever‚Äù I thought, as I continued washing myself. It was only after a solid 5/6 minutes of showering, I realized I STILL HAD MY FUCKING AIRPODS IN. shit.

&amp;#x200B;

Some backstory.

&amp;#x200B;

So this happened a few weeks ago, couple of days before Christmas, actually. I‚Äôm on leave (paid vacation in the military), so I text my friend and ask him what he‚Äôs up to. I will refer to this friend as B henceforth. I‚Äôve known B for a few years; I met the dude on Omegle several summers ago and we really hit it off. From there, him and I exchanged Discord usernames after a few hours of chatting and quickly developed a friendship online, despite never meeting each other in the flesh and the fact that we had two completely different personalities. We would always play COD together, fuck around with people on Omegle, or just talk. I should mention that B is also a furry. B tells me that he‚Äôs free, so we talk about me coming down to visit him and his boyfriend (let‚Äôs just call B‚Äôs boyfriend Tony from here) for a few days and he thinks that it‚Äôd be a great idea, so I book my flight. The next day, I fly down to Tampa and B picks me up. We shoot the shit for a bit, talking about how nice it is to finally hang out, until we arrive at his place. The next few nights are really just partying and getting drunk and B and Tony showing me around Tampa, amongst other shit.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the fuck-up.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I know it, it‚Äôs my last night with them, so B decides to bust out the magic mushrooms after some discussion. I tell him I‚Äôve never tried any psychedelics before. He says I‚Äôll be fine. Fuck it. After a bit of research, along with some preparation, I decide that I‚Äôm finally ready. I was a bit anxious, and didn‚Äôt really know what to expect, but I trusted B nonetheless. He gives me 1.5 grams of what he describes to me as a ‚Äúgentler strain‚Äù mixed in with a smoothie to start me off. I inhale the thing. About 20 minutes pass. I soon notice that my field of vision expands. ‚ÄúB, I SEE EVERYTHING,‚Äù I keep on saying. I then start talking out of my ass like I‚Äôm fucking Socrates or some shit. Regardless, I handle the first batch well. Aside from an enhanced cone of vision and the philosophizing, I don‚Äôt notice any other effects. B notices how well I‚Äôm taking the high, so he whips up another smoothie after I agree to it, this time with a stronger strain of shrooms. Also 1.5 grams. I down it within 5 minutes. Once again, I feel nothing at first. But then, after about another 30 to 45 minutes, that‚Äôs when things start to go wrong. I‚Äôm suddenly laughing my ass off at some shitty inside joke between the two of us, repeating it over and over again, being loud as fuck. The next, I‚Äôm sweating literal **GALLONS** of perspiration and my heart is fucking racing. Then, for some reason, my body forgets how to breathe, so I have to think about inhaling, then exhaling. Breathing manually is the best way that I can describe it. Then B plays some wild music, and I close my eyes and all I see is naked dudes teabagging me. It was fucking WEIRD. B then hands me some water, and, for some reason, this is what set off my extreme paranoia. I immediately get up from his couch where I was sitting, grab my phone and wallet from a nearby table, and start putting my shoes on, telling him that I was gonna go for a walk. He tells me that it wasn‚Äôt a good idea. After some thought, I reluctantly agree, deciding that it wasn‚Äôt the best idea to go outside when you‚Äôre high as fuck off of shrooms, but I‚Äôm still just as paranoid, so I go outside to a screened-in porch-like area through an adjoining sliding glass door in his apartment and just sit out there with his dog. He brings Tony into the living room with him, now extremely concerned. I chill for a bit outside and then come back inside and then tell him that I think he tried to drug me with the water and pull a Bill Cosby on me. I argue with B and Tony for a bit, still not convinced that I can trust either one of them. I then lock myself in their bathroom for about 30 minutes while I piece together the events that have unfolded in the past hour. I sort out my thoughts try to make sense of everything, and eventually come to the conclusion that I wasn‚Äôt drugged and B wasn‚Äôt tryna toss my salad. I had known him for years; if he wanted to drug and then rape someone, he would have done it long before I hung out with him. B is obviously hurt, so I apologize to him and Tony for being a cockhead, and they both go to bed while I crash on the couch, now with a killer stomach ache.

This in not an ad, but, god, I love this drive.  Anyway, I have been planning a clean install of Windows to wipe all the junk, and  today was the day.

Backed up  everything, even downloaded any weird driver and app that I want to  install manually, created a bootable USB. Everything in its place. I  start the boot from USB process as usual, and then it hits me. In the  step where you choose partitions, after deleting everything, it only  shows 250 gigs of unallocated space.

WHERE'S  THE OTHER HALF??? My mind is racing, some wacky stuff I recently  downloaded might have broken something, but why didn't the problem  appear the previous days? Maybe the drive is broken, maybe a bug. This  is not what I imagined the day to be. I already start thinking if I have  enough money to get a new 1TB SSD and get done with it, but I don't.

I  start my google search, start downloading tools, searching for that  weird tip hidden in the 3rd page of google search. Nothing works. I open  Device Manager, and it lists my SSD as ""Samsung 850 evo 250GB Sata"". At  this point, I'm sure it's a virus that has permanently damaged my ssd.

Or,  could it be? When could that happened? Maybe... someone stole my ssd  and replaced it with another, all while copying the data so that I don't  find out about it. I open the back of the laptop, unscrew the drive,  and there it is, a Samsung 850 evo 250GB Sata SSD. So... it's really  possible that someone replaced it? The laptop hasn't gone out of the  house for almost a year.

Then I  decide to check the receipt. Log in to the eshop that I had ordered  from, go to my orders history, and there it is. An order for a Samsung  850 evo 250GB Sata SSD drive.

Am I starting to turn insane?

TLDR:  Tried to reinstall windows, I thought I had a 500GB SSD, but I had a  250GB one, and I spent 2 hours trying to fix the problem because I  thought it was infected by a virus and it had lost half capacity.",17,0,tifu
t3_ktoq68,TIFU by assuming my boyfriend was cheating on me,"This happened when we first started dating.

His mobile used to ping and light up when someone texted him and once I saw that someone had texted him with the name ""Babe ‚ù§Ô∏è"" I didn't think of it as anything and that I had not seen it correctly but next coming weeks I saw it happening many times. He would get really happy when the person texted, used to smile really big and all. I started thinking I was being cheated on, the last straw for me was when the person texted ""love you too"" I confronted him about and he stared at me for some time before he started laughing.

I cried because what the hell, so he calmed me down and explained to me that Babe is his grandmother, her name is Baberuth and everyone in the family called her Babe, she recently had gotten her first smartphone and he had taught her to text, so when she texted it was exciting for him to see her using emojis and stuff.

Never felt so embarrassed in my life. A few months later he took me to meet her and I kid you not, for a 85 year old Babe is a sport. Seeing her punch a guy square in the jaw for harassing was a sight. We are best friends now.

TL;DR I assumed my boyfriend was cheating on me but it was just his grandmother texting him.

t3_ktommy,"TIFU by leading a group of American tourists who wanted to visit a portion of the Berlin Wall, but instead I took them to a completely random place in the opposite direction.","This happened in 2015. I don‚Äôt remember the details, but here‚Äôs the gist of what happened.

I was backpacking in Europe in 2015. As I arrived to my hostel room in Berlin, I met a group of some really nice American tourists. We chatted for a bit, and since I was travelling solo, I asked to join them for some beers that night; it all went well, as far as I remember.

Next day, they wanted to visit some specific portion of the Berlin Wall (or something like that, I really don‚Äôt remember the details) and invited me to tag along (or maybe I invited myself). I had lived for 2 years in Germany back in 2007 (not in Berlin, although I had been there before), so I took the lead of the expedition; I located the place on Google Maps and told the guys to just follow me - which they did.

Worth reminding there was another Brazilian guy who was travelling by himself in our group, and he *kinda* objected to where we were going. But I wanted to impress my foreign buddies ‚ÄúI‚Äôm almost German, I‚Äôve been here before, I know what I‚Äôm doing, trust me!‚Äù, so I *kinda* shut him off. Sorry, dude.

We walked for a while and got a tram for about 30 minutes (which was looking suspicious, as the place wasn‚Äôt supposed to be that far). After getting out of the tram and walking a couple of kilometers, we got to our destination ‚Äì there we found‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ NOTHING! Only a completely shut building. Either the place on Google Maps was misnamed, or I made some mistake (which may be more likely I guess). I have no idea‚Ä¶

At first, we were confused‚Ä¶ but I realized my fuck-up almost immediately, and I‚Äôm pretty sure they did as well.

‚ÄúOh, uuh, the ‚Äúplace‚Äù must be this house, and it‚Äôs closed‚Ä¶ oh well, tough luck‚Ä¶‚Äù, someone may have said...

Thankfully they were quite nice ‚Äì or as nice as you can be ‚Äì with the fact that a total stranger led them to fuck-away from every and anything remotely worth seeing in Berlin; and even though it was quite obvious I took'em to the wrong place, no one acknowledged that fact (out loud), and they all just kinda agreed that ‚Äúthe place was closed‚Äù - maybe because they didn‚Äôt want to embarrass me? Idk...

It was a long way back to the hostel. Later on they they‚Äôd go visit some other place, but this time I declined the invitation (if there was one‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt remember really).

To this day, I cringe so hard when I remember this event.. The arrival, the emptiness there, everyone already tired, the obvious looks of frustration, the way back‚Ä¶ oh, how the way back sucked.‚Ä¶

Anyway‚Ä¶ sorry I made you guys lose a day in Berlin. At least the tram ride was fun‚Ä¶?

TL;DR volunteered to lead a group of tourists to a touristic spot, ended up taking them to the middle of fucking nowhere in Berlin.",14,0,tifu
t3_ktjqjk,TIFU by by going through my boyfriends things and finding a vail of 'sand'.,"Okay so disclaimer, this happened while I was dating my now husband about 6 years ago. I still laugh at this story in hindsight and wanted to share it with you.

So my BF and I had been dating for about a month, and he decided to invited me over to his house for dinner. I was pretty excited to be able to see where he lived and enjoy a nice night of pizza and Netflix. It was a pretty great night, we had great chemistry and the pizza was good. We hung out in his room to watch Netflix because that was where he kept his largest TV and Playstation. We snuggled for a while and he excused himself to go to the bathroom. 

'Perfect,' I thought, 'now I can snoop for a bit!' I didn't want to violate his privacy too much but I was super curious and wanted to look at all the things he had out and about on his dresser and shelves(fair game right?). He had lots to look at: books, collectibles, photos, and diffrent kinds of nick-nacks. As I was going through the shelves I found two containers of white sand. One was a large glass, round jar and the other was a small vial(like what you would hang on a necklace). Both containers where sealed with rubber stoppers. My first thought were that these were souvenirs from trips. I myself owned a jar of sand and shells from Florida from a family vacation. I picked up and examined the larger and put it down. No shells in it at all. I then picked up the smaller vail and started rotating it to see if there was anything in the sand. Nope, nothing. 

Turns out the stopper was not as secure on the small one. Much to my horror, the stopper fell out and the sand went down my front and all over the floor. I stood there trying to decide what to do, there was no way to put the sand back, maybe I could just hide it? 

Nope! He returned to the room at that moment. I turned around, deer in the headlights, 'I'm sorry, I spilt this thing of sand.'

'Uuhhhmmmm, that wasn't sand. That was full of my dead fianc√© ashes.'

So there I was. Not only caught in the act of snooping the moment he left the room, but I was also coated in a fine layer of his dead fianc√©. I immediately start tearing up and shaking. 'Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. Oh my God! What do I dooooo?!' I stood stock still, my first thought was to try to brush HIS DEAD FIANC√â off my hands/shirt, but that would be disrespectful right? I mean I can't just shake her off of me and on to the floor. OMG, I SPILT HER ON THE CARPET, WHAT DO WE DO!? SHE IS EVERYWHERE. HE IS GOING TO BE SO PISSED! AM I NOW GOING TO BE HAUNTED BY THE ANGRY GHOST OF HIS DEAD FIANC√â?

He was surprisingly calm for what was going on and  quickly brushed me off. He then walked me out side to dust my hands into the garden, and then went to go get the vacuum. All the while I'm blubbering like a baby, dying from embarrassment, and waiting to be scolded for spilling his dead fianc√© all over myself. He took me back inside and sat me down to calm down. I must have sat there and cried for a good 5 minutes while he patted my back and tried to comfort me. He was very kind and understanding, but I was still so mortified. Not only did I spill the vail, but I was also having a panic attack about it. But in my defense, its not everyday you accidentally spill a dead person on yourself. But like he should be the upset one, not me right? 

I calmed down, and he explained that it was okay. He actually owned half of her ashes and they where safety out of MY reach and in the top of the closet. The vail was a memento from the ceremony. I was quite lucky I didn't spill the larger one, because that one was his dead best friend and all he had. 

Moral of the story, dont snoop! And if you keep dead people in your house, please properly label them to avoid confusion. 

TL;DR While snooping through my BFs stuff I found and spilt a small vail of 'beach sand'. Plot twist! It wasn't sand, but the cremated remains of his dead fianc√©.",26,9,tifu
t3_ktnv10,TIFU by breaking my word in a Russian prison,"It happened in a Russian prison. In a Penal Colony, to be precise. We celebrated the 2014 New Year on a grand scale - homemade cakes, a lot of salads consisting of everything, and home brew... Lots of home brew. 

The morning of January 1st comes. Everyone is slowly waking up and coming to their senses. Life returns to it's usual groove. A friend comes to visit me. He lives in another barrack. But if careful and imperceptible, it was possible to violate territory of the local sector. He was a good friend; we constantly supported each other. We would share useful things, and sometimes, we stood up for serious conflicts. 

\- Well, have you given up smoking? 

\- What do you mean? - (I did not understand.) 

\- Well, we have agreed to quit smoking together on January 1st. At 23:57 I smoked the last cigarette and that's it. Have you forgotten? 

\- No! Of course I remember! Same shit - I haven't smoked since night. 

I say all this, and feel my face turn red. I had a desire to sink into the floor. I completely forgot about our agreement, and extinguished the last cigarette literally a second before his arrival. We discussed something else, wished eachother a Happy New Year, drank tea  and he left. I remember looking at this cloudy sediment in a mug and realized that this was it. My fucked up shame. It's not when someone laughs at you and says something behind your back, insults you or tries to humiliate you. No. It is a shame to your conscience, character and will. Since that day I have not smoked. I just couldn't afford to be so weak. 

I have been without cigarettes for seven years now, and I am incredibly happy about that. By the way, a friend lit a cigarette two weeks later. I do not blame him. Life too taught me this.

t3_ktnwyo,TIFU by reacting like a robot to my neighbor's baby announcement,"This happened over the holidays, but I still feel embarrassed by it.  

I have vague recollection of my wife telling me a neighbor in our condo had a baby.  It wasn't someone I had met so I generally didn't pay much attention when she told me.

Flash forward to holiday week.  I was walking down the hallway and one of my neighbors, who I had never met, stepped out of his door.  I politely wished him a happy holiday.  I couldn't help but notice he had a stack of delivered boxes sitting outside his door.   As I was walking by him, I go, ""oh wow!  Looks like you got a lot of presents!""

He responded, ""Oh these are all for my daughter.  She's coming home from the hospital today.""

Now, in that moment... I couldn't calculate exactly what those words meant.  This was my first time interacting with this person.  My wife had mentioned something about a baby, but I hadn't paid attention.  I figured I had two options.

* Option 1:  Excitedly exclaim, ""Oh wow!  Congrats!  You must be so excited!""

* Option 2:  In a concerned tone say, ""Oh jeeze.  She was in the hospital?  Is everything ok??!""

Instead, I went with Option #3... which was to unemotionally say ""oh"", nod my head as a sign of understanding, and then awkwardly walk away.    

We were both wearing masks, but I could tell he was perplexed by my bizarre non-response.  He lingered in the doorway gazing at me as I sheepishly escaped into my condo.  

I immediately texted my wife for clarification and she's like, ""you dumbass I told you they had a newborn they were bringing home from the hospital!""

I'm still pretty embarrassed by it.  I've been playing it out in my head.  The neighbor probably thinks I hate babies or my ""oh"" was a sign of me being upset I'd be hearing a baby crying.   I'll probably try and save face and get a baby gift this weekend I can leave on their doorstep.

Now, I live in a country where we use the metric system exclusively and during this corona/WFH time I say, you know let's join the gym and lose all the chub I've gained so far. I may not be the world's fastest runner but I'd say I'm pretty fit, I was a regular Sunday league player and used to play racquet sports often.  

This is where I fucked up royally, I used to keep my 3-mile time a bit hush-hush about 25 mins and one day at the treadmill I hit a 22 min my all-time best. I then proceed to take a photo and gloat it to all my friends and family saying that I ran ""3 km"" (not miles) in 22 mins.  

This is where my slander begins, I was getting wrecked left, right and centre. Heck, even my 60-year-old dad said that his walking is faster than my ""3km"" timing. My friends were sending me screenshots of them running 5 km in 24 mins. And I was shocked, at the very least to see those timings. There was no chance in hell that these donnies (who are as fit as me, if not less) are running almost twice the distance in almost half the time. And checking 5 km timings online did not help either, I was seeing the average timing for my age is about 20 min and seeing the women's timings made me even more depressed. And this went on for weeks until I overheard the gym trainer instructing a new member to run 2 ""MILES."" And then it hit me, the treadmill displayed the distance in miles and not in km.

t3_kth653,TIFU by trying to be sexy for my bf,"My boyfriend (J) and I are super sexual but we are also trolls. Every week, he has a live DJ stream. During these streams, I sit right next to the camera, not in the line of view but just to the side of it. I love to show my support! SOMETIMES, I also love to troll and I love to get my sexual needs satisfied. What does this mean? I‚Äôll dress in some sort of lingerie or expose myself so he gets to only sometimes glance at me (typically, as he streams, he rarely disconnects from the camera) aka only sometimes look and no touching. Basically, I‚Äôll dress up and chill there while he finishes his set, just to be a tease and be funny and sexy and whatever the fuck reason. 

Anyway, I go get dressed about 15 mins before I know he‚Äôs going to finish his set. Today‚Äôs outfit is literally barely anything. It‚Äôs a brand new fit and he‚Äôs never seen it before. I don‚Äôt really wanna say what the outfit is but it‚Äôs prob best that I explain it so you can truly understand how embarrassing this is. It isn‚Äôt your typical lingerie. It‚Äôs black stockings with just a belt garter, like vajayjay less and ass less. I think you‚Äôre suppose to wear this with some sort of panties like a thong but I didn‚Äôt. So nothing covering my goodies. And then ‚Äúx‚Äù black nipple pasties. AND I felt like that was too plain, so I had also put in a purple gemmed butt plug, also brand new. Pretty much, wearing nothing.

I show up to the room, sit down next to the camera, definitely not in view of the stream, and he catches a glimpse of me. J decides to end the stream early (yay me!), puts on the last song, and turns off his streaming camera. And then I get up and hug him.... the twitch camera is off, it‚Äôs fine. I turn around, spread my cheeks to show him the brand new plug, and he spanks me. Then we start making out. BUT fucking guess tf what: his IG live story was still ON! He realizes it as we start kissing cuz he looks behind me and saw his phone. He‚Äôs on IG live with his phone, as well. fuck! We forgot about this one. Usually IG kicks him off of live within 30 mins of his stream, but for some fuckin reason, it decides to let him stream all the way through. He, gently yet hastily, shoves me off to the side and turns off his phone. I run to the bathroom, freak out a bit, and then come back to the room. 

So what‚Äôs the damage? 

He still had 3 viewers. We don‚Äôt know who exactly was watching. But J suspected one of his younger cousins was on. Her brother (A) is someone we play video games with damn near every night. So we try to shake it off and say ‚Äúit is what it is. It‚Äôs fine‚Äù. But I had a very difficult time doing this cuz my whole ass and titties were just out and about live on camera. I started to contemplate things like ‚Äúwell, do you think they could see my outfit or just my birthday suit? Cuz i mean nakedness is normal but this outfit, with the butt plug, it‚Äôs a bit much‚Äù. He consoles me and reassures me that everything will be ok. 

We do our deed and then sign on to play video games and A is on and we get into a party with him and he fucking mother fuckin says ‚Äúhey J. I think I saw something I wasn‚Äôt suppose to see‚Äù

You know those times in cartoons where a character just melts or slides down a flight of stairs hugging every step? That‚Äôs how i felt. I melted on the spot. I was like ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt need to talk about that.‚Äù This kid is like 21 and we‚Äôre in our mid 30s and we interact all the time cuz we play so much. He‚Äôs actually one of my favorite teammates. It‚Äôs been a week since this has happened and I still think about it. 

I was so mortified. I am still mortified. I actually keep most of my sexual life behind closed doors, as I‚Äôm sure most people do. I believe a lot of my sexual tendencies are pretty kinky but they are SO normal and natural to me that this pushes me to be embarrassed by it all. Not quite sure if that makes sense. I think this whole ordeal just really embarrassed me. 

TL;DR: I got dressed up in barely anything lingerie and exposed my whole body, including me spreading my cheeks to show off my butt plug on a live stream",117,16,tifu
t3_ktg63s,TIFU by sous viding the baby,"A few years ago when me and my wife's baby was about 5 months old, my wife decided to go out for the evening with her girlfriends. This was the first time she had gone out since the birth and basically since the pregnancy, so she was really excited and I was happy for her. She was understandably a bit hesitant to leave the baby but she knew I would take care of him as we had both gotten really good at doing.

After she left, everything starting out pretty much the same as always. Our baby was well into weaning at that point and he loved trying new foods, so dinners were always a nice experience, even when a fistful of food would occassionally find its way somewhere across the room. When I went to give him his bath though, everything started to go wrong.

The hot water in the house wasn't working when I tried to run the bath. It was working earlier that day so the problem was very unexpected and very frustrating. I obviously didn't want to give him a cold bath, nor did I want to forget the bath altogether (although perhaps I should have). It was at that point I had what I still consider to be an amazing, genius idea: the sous vide machine.

For anyone who doesn't know what a sous vide is, it's a kind of cooking machine that you place into a bath of water and it raises the temperature of the water to the exact temperature you want. We had gotten it as a gift several years before but barely ever used it, so perhaps now was the ideal opportunity. The sous vide came with a plastic water bath that was actually a perfect size for a baby, and so I filled it up with cold water and set the temperature to exactly 37.5¬∞c. A few minutes later the temperature was just right so I gave him his little pre-wash and then in the sous vide he went.

He didn't seem to really notice or care about this new bath of his, and to be honest the only real difference I noticed was that he was now sploshing water around the kitchen instead of the bathroom. Seeing him in the sous vide was pretty cute though (I thought), so I decided to snapchat a picture of it to my wife. She saw the picture of it pretty much instantly and replied normally with a bunch of laughing emojis. And that was it, just a cute little moment I thought.

But apparently not. When my wife got home she was quite upset. I asked her what was wrong and she said that one of her friends had seen the picture I sent and started freaking out, asking if I was an abuser who tortured her and our kid. At first my wife thought it was a joke but her friend was far from messing around. After a few minutes she got pretty hysterical and demanded that my wife speak to the police or a social worker or anyone who could help. Eventually my wife just left crying. I thought the whole thing was completely bizarre.

My wife's friend eventually calmed down and the two of them are still friends. Apparently she still occassionally asks if I'm a sadistic psychopath though. Whenever me and her see each other I can always sense this cold disapproving look in her eye too, like she's a private detective trying to sus me out. I've grown to find it pretty funny over the years actually. Still, if she ever comes over for dinner I think the sous vide should probably stay in the cupboard.

TL;DR - I decided to use a sous vide machine to bathe my baby because the hot water was broken, snapped a picture of it to my wife, her friend saw it and now thinks I'm a psychopath.",1294,163,tifu
t3_ktfxap,TIFU by using Delta-8 for the first time and not knowing its effects,"TIFU for the first time like this.  Still reeling over what happened. It's been quite a crazy day and I swear I won't do it again.

I'm not a weed user, I am a cbd user.  I don't like the idea of getting high, either.  Which is why I did not expect the effects of using a brand new vape tank would be being high off my ass.

As best as I can remember (kind of having some issues remembering it but if I try hard enough...)  I recently was running out of my vape juice in one of the disposable tanks I occasionally buy.  Hadn't used the vape in such a long time but because of personal events I know that vaping gets the quickest results for me to try to relax.  Figured it was near time to purchase a new one.  I went to the site I usually go on to get my cbd items and I found it's been so long since I ordered a vape tank that they don't sell the ones I buy anymore.

Now, I have to say that before I go on, that I usually purchase plain old cbd with the smallest of thc.  I don't go any higher than 500mg as well.  But since I'm seeing new flavors I figure why not go for something different. After browsing  I come across a flavor called Apple Fritter.  I love apple fritters.  So I give it a quick look at.  Huh, Delta-8. 900mg.  Must be a new strain or something, no issues here.  I go and purchase it, wait a few days for its arrival.

I went and grabbed it today.  Got the box from my mail and went upstairs to my apartment.  I switched out my tank, turned on my vape stick, warmed it up, and took a puff.

INSTANTLY I realized I fucked up.  I can't breathe and I start coughing violently and uncontrollably.  I can't stop and it won't stop.  I end up throwing up once I crawl over to my shower.  Over and over again.  Then I begin to notice something is wrong with me.  I don't know how long it was till I figured out that I couldn't feel anything, my whole body felt fuzzy as if it fell asleep and I couldn't keep my eyes in one place.

I managed to stop throwing up and scramble to find out what is wrong with me while I am still coughing.  I refused to call 911 (American, I won't be in debt more than I am already) so instead after finding no results about what is happening to me, I somehow manage to get to my bed and spam call my partner to have him figure out what the fuck is going on.

I couldn't get a grip on reality.  I couldn't focus.  Every moment felt like it wasn't real, but also was.  I thought I was dying.  I was really scared and I started sobbing to my partner on the phone while he tried to see what he could do to help me (fyi he doesn't live in the same place and was completely unavailable to get to me).

After what felt like an eternity, with my sister eventually on the call with me as well, and as I lay there just feeling like I may be dying or tripping balls so bad I can't cope, we found out the reason for my reaction.

Delta-8 is a legal high. And I was having a very bad trip.

I didn't know that would happen!  I didn't think I had to look up what Delta-8 was, as far as I knew I thought it was a different strain of cbd.  There was no way I could tell that this would happen, and because I inhaled too much my body panicked and at the same time got so fucking trippin balls that I straight spiraled into a bad trip.

Thankfully I'm fine now.  I waited it out till I was lucid enough to call a friend and have him drive me to my sister's place where I waited out the rest.  I'm still a little high, had some munchies, and now that I barely feel the effects I am back home eating some ice cream.  But I will never, ever, EVER use Delta-8 again. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

I stupidly didn't do my research on Delta-8 and in result had too much to inhale on my vape pen and spiraled myself into the worst trip as my first trip.",11,1,tifu

So I'm up at my friend's house in Vermont, old ski house, 120 years old. We've all been hanging out all week so after a full day of skiing I decided to treat myself to a nice long shower. 

(Bathroom is the only one in the house, we're all drinking beers. The shower is a very basic and is basically a metal box with a shower head)

I start watching some porn because my buddies are playing some tunes and my girlfriend is busy working. I'm feeling frisky so why the hell not. Meow. So anyways I get to showering and some self care when I go to adjust where in the ""film"" I'm at. I push the screen to move the bar then my phone just falls down a dark crevice where there's a slit just wider than my phone. Fuckkk. 

Naturally, instead of getting right to finding my phone, I sort myself out so I can focus. This fucking movie is a full feature length film and it's moving past the quieter blowjob part. I try pulling the shower out but it's glued to the floor. Then I get clothed to run to my car, past everyone, trying to keep it cool and grab a flat head to pull the panel of the shower out. No one any wiser I run back upstairs and find the fucking panel is so rusted to the other panels it's essentially glued in place. Again, fuck.  

There was a little attic space that was unfinished abutting the bathroom and directly behind the shower. I notice it's particle board over the top of sheet rock. I do as any self respecting man who's phone is blasting some girl getting railed by some rather gifted men and I start digging. I'm like Andy in Shawshank Redemption, careful not to make any noise when in between lulls in songs.

Light at the end of the tunnel! Holy fucking shit! I'm sweating while ripping away dry wall, careful not to make too much noise. After ripping away about half what I needed to take out my girlfriend knocks on the door... ""Honey, is everything okay? it seems like you've been in here a while?"" She asked while there is some muffled moaning that to me sounds super loud. ""Errr yes, I think the chili is just getting to me, nasty stuff going on in here"" She walks back downstairs and I get back to pulling off particle board/drywall. 

Finally! About 15 old razor blades and soap bars fall down and just behind it my phone! Thank Jesus! I walk back downstairs feeling like a champ and grab some freshly made curry. 

Tl;dr I go to have some self care after a long day of skiing and drop my phone in the trench behind an old shower. Have to dig through drywall and particle board in order to get at it while I'm above my friends and girlfriend.",33,4,tifu

t3_ktaa0v,TIFU by not knowing how to use my dishwasher properly for years,"This may not be a huge TIFU to some, but it's been a revelation to me. 


Like most people, last year really took its toll on my mental health. People I loved have died and life has been about as sane and positive as a Trump tweet. 


Chaos has ruled my house. We've been home schooling two young children while me and my wife work demanding full time jobs in the room next door. We're lucky to still be working and have a roof over our heads, but trying to do it all at once has driven us into the ground. 


One of the most difficult things I've found is staying positive while our home looks like the before photo from an episode of Hoarders. 


Shit has been piled everywhere because we've just not had time to tidy. Everytime we get around to it, the job is so huge we don't do it again for another week and it all starts over again. I've felt completely out of control. 


Now here's my TIFU. Rather than empty the dishwasher I've always figured it just saved time to use clean stuff straight out of the trays. Why bother taking everything out at once when it's just going to be put back there anyway, right?


This week it occurred to just empty the dishwasher every morning and fill it with dirty dishes through the day. Then empty that sucker the MOMENT it beeps. No more shit piled in the sink or on the side, everything is where I can find it and we've not had to clean the kitchen all week.


It's such a small thing but it gave me a feeling of control I've not had for about 6 months. One less room of chaos, one less cleaning job to worry about and just a little bit less mental pressure on my blancmange of a brain.


For the life of me I can't understand why I didn't figure this out before. I'm a pretty smart guy, but for years I've dreaded going into my kitchen, let alone bring guests over.

t3_ktdzt7,TIFU by using a hairdryer to clear my swimmer‚Äôs ear,"5 years ago, while on my honeymoon, my wife and I went on a snorkeling/booze cruise and I managed to get a fair amount of water in my ear. (half drunk on rum and snorkeling‚Ä¶go figure) In my drunken stupor I alternated between using a hairdryer and cue tips to attempt to relieve the pressure but eventually gave up and went to bed.  The next day the pressure was not nearly as bad, but a faint case of tinnitus came in its place. Assuming that I did some sort of slight permanent damage and not wanting to ruin the rest of the honeymoon, I tried to put it behind me and continued on my way.  
Fast-forward to last week, the tinnitus never went away, and I have avoided getting my ears wet at all due to them clogging at the slightest sign of pressure.  One afternoon, I was scrolling aimlessly on my phone and received a targeted ad for some ear canal camera/ear cleaner device and figured‚Ä¶ sure why not. The camera showed up yesterday and my mind was blown to see the solid wall of yellow/ green earwax staring right back at me. 
Shocked, confused, and pretty grossed out, I was able to get an appointment at the Drs office for this morning and after the nurse soaking my ear canal in hydrogen peroxide for 20 minutes and pressure washed with warm water, she was met with a tsunami of rust colored ear wax.
Five years later, I have no sign of the tinnitus, and can finally hear clearly from my left ear.

t3_ktdwr9,TIFU by recommending my favourite video game to my friend with epilepsy,"Obligatory apology for shitty spelling, grammar, etc. On mobile and it is 12am where I live, so I am really sleepy.

I'm going to start this story of by giving everyone reading this some much needed context. Bioshock Infinite is my (16m) favourite video game, and it has been since I first played it roughly midway through 2019. I loved everything about it and would definitely say it is a perfect game, anyway, let's save my long-winded review of Bioshock Infinite for another time and get back to the story...

On new year's day, my friends and I decided to have a ""virtual new year's party"" on a discord voice call. My friend with epilepsy (16f, I'll just call her ""B"") was in the voice call and she asked for some game recommendations for the Steam sale, naturally my dumb ass saw yet another opportunity to gush about Bioshock Infinite, and you better believe my dumb ass snatched that fuckin' opportunity up as soon as it could... 

I proceeded to give B a really long and in depth explanation as to why Bioshock Infinite is the greatest thing since tummy rubs, and how she should play it because it's perfect, etc... What I completely forgot to mention was that there are a ton of visual elements of the game that could cause seizures, as the fact that she was epileptic slipped my mind.

Fast forward to today, we were busy playing a game together when she told me that she just bought Bioshock Infinite (for its usual price) before we started playing, as she missed her opportunity to buy it when it was on sale, she then said ""OP, even though I bought the game, I still haven't opened it, because I forgot to ask you whether or not it could induce seizures""... 

I proceeded to apologize profusely and even though she could refund it, I offered to pay her back what the amount that she bought the game for, as I felt like it would compensate for me being the neglectful and shitty friend that I was, she declined my offer and told me that ""it's chilled, I should've asked""

Now I feel like a major asshole, and like I've been a really shitty friend towards B because I forgot to consider her epilepsy.

TLDR: Bioshock Infinite is my favourite game ever, I decided to recommend it to my epileptic friend during an online new year's party, she bought it today when the Steam sale ended, asked me whether she should be careful with potential seizures induced by the game, I feel really bad for forgetting to take her epilepsy into consideration when recommending the game",11,5,tifu

Everytime I poop, I go shower immediately after. It's just something that has been ingrained in me (by me) from a young age.

This morning, I did my business and then headed into the shower. I shampoo'd my hair since this was my first shower of the day, and I washed the shampoo away. A strand of hair got in my mouth and I struggled to get it out. I did, eventually, and I washed it away noting the size since I had recently (a month ago) shaved my head.

Part of my showering regiment is to soft scrub my lips. I started to do so. My butt crack itched, so I just reached back and scratched it, then went back to scrubbing my lip. A few seconds later, I felt a hair in my mouth so I tried to get it out. I struggled again and it moved to the back of my mouth. I opened my mouth to the shower and got some water in there and tried to gurgle the hair forward. I did, and I pulled it out. I looked at it noting the size of it, and it was twice as long as the hair on my head.

I began to wonder were it was from I plucked a hair from my arm pit and compared the size and it was off, so I let that hair flow away with the water. I kept wondering where the hair that long was from... And then it hit me...

I immediately let it go, flowing away with the water, and I threw up all over my freshly cleaned body at my disgust. I took a long moment to compose myself, before I turned the water to a hotter temperature and begin to clean everything up, turning my normal 20 minute shower, into an hour long ordeal...

I had to fly to Holland for a job. My former boss and his wife have a house in Amsterdam, as the wife is Dutch. The plan is for former boss to fly in the following day and his wife the day following him. I arrive at the house and unpack my things. I then explore the city a bit and return to the house without incident. If you've been to Amsterdam, you know that bottled liquor sales end relatively early, due to excessive partying. However, former boss being the rich douche that he was- had an extensive liquor cabinet and an even more impressive champagne rack. In a few moments, you'll understand why these two bits of info tie together info into a fuck up.


Some time later, I decided to go out and see the night life. After only one turn of a corner, I happen upon two lovely-looking young ladies in what seems to be a minorly distraught conversation. I decided to ask if everything was ok. To which they replied they had forgotten to buy liquor before the stores stopped selling and were trying to figure out what to do. I mention the fully stocked liquor cabinet at my place around the corner.


They were understandably a bit apprehensive at a tall, foreign, male stranger offering them liquor and said they would wait at the corner if I went to get booze. ""What do you like?"" I asked, not wanting to miss an opportunity to drink with such good looking company. God blessed Dutch women's looks, truly.


""Tequila.""


I quickly returned to the house and grabbed an ordinary-looking bottle of tequila off the shelf. It seemed to have had a drink taken from it already. A safe bet, I reasoned with myself. Long story short, we proceeded to get hammered on the tequila at their place and then went out dancing all night. In the end, I was towed home sitting on the back of a bicycle, in true Hollander fashion. 


The next day, my boss arrives. I was passed out on a couch in the living room. I heard him coming in; so, I got myself up. He still had his bags in hand as he stopped in front of the liquor cabinet for a long moment, his gaze glued to it. With a hint of fear in his voice I'd never heard before, he says, ""Where's the bottle of tequila that was here?""


""I drank it last night with some girls, why do you ask?"" A bit unnerved as to why it had garnered such immediate attention and tone.


You're probably thinking to yourself right now, ""OP drank some ridiculously expensive bottle of tequila."" You'd be wrong. It's much, much worse. &gt;!""That bottle was the final gift my wife received from her mother, before my wife's mother passed away. I'm going to need you to go find that bottle. Now."" (Keep in mind, wife is flying in the following day)!&lt;


Obviously, I began shitting bricks. I had no idea who these girls we're or how to find them and they had that bottle- assuming it had not already been recycled. &gt;!Thankfully, it was a super common bottle of tequila and I simply purchased a new one from a liquor store to replace it and everyone lived happily ever after.

So, it's nearly midnight on New Year's Eve. Normally, I'm in bed and fast asleep by the time the clock strikes twelve (I know, how boring) but this year I was both awake and in the mood for some amazing sex. Great way to see the New Year in, right? 

Everything was going great - that is, until I experience an agonising pain in my hip accompanied by a cracking sound. Sex most definitely at the very back of my mind at that point, I tried convincing myself and my partner that everything was fine and I did not need to go to hospital. Neither of us convinced by my feeble attempts to pretend I was OK, a scramble to get dressed (while I could barely move) so I could go and get it checked out.

One trip to A&amp;E, an awkward explanation, some x-rays and painkillers later, it was confirmed I had dislocated my hip.

I had a close friend in college that I basically saw as a sister, but after some time I noticed she started acting weird. It took me a while to figure it out but I eventually pieced things together to that she was attracted to me and I guess expected me to reciprocate. I contemplated it because am dude but the image of me banging my sister and having to treat her as a partner rather than a friend resonated harder than my dick. Rejecting her was also a problem, because she was a close friend and no way that wouldn‚Äôt change after a rejection I assumed. So it‚Äôs a strange problem...

Dumbass me had a great solution tho: Just look less attractive! Now I had no beard I could shave or guy I could pay to kick my ass or anything. But more importantly, I also had no fucking clue why a girl - or any girl I‚Äôd had - would find me attractive. All I know is I‚Äôm tall, funny and have maybe good hair. So I turn to thinking what women find unattractive. Weakness! is my first and only thought. ‚ÄúAll I gotta do is cry and whine about something in my life in front of her. Lies but white lies‚Äù I reasoned (im ok with occasional white lies from anyone idk) All that matters is she never know I lied. But also it‚Äôs still gotta be believable. So it‚Äôs gotta be something touchy. So I look at my mom‚Äôs side of the family which lives in Portugal and think ‚Äúit‚Äôs genius I‚Äôll just have a fake uncle and be really torn about how he‚Äôs fucking dead.‚Äù

Now I don‚Äôt remember it entirely, but I‚Äôm alone with this girl somewhere and I play my act. And man you should‚Äôve seen the look on her face. Might as well had told her I‚Äôd fucked my dad or something. But it‚Äôs too late to turn this sinking ship around I say so I continue and wrap it up as soon as possible. She did give some semblance of an expected supportive response, but really I have no clue if or how she bought it. And regardless, instant regret bc was weird and made the shit a whole lot weirder. Attractive? Unattractive? Weird. Don‚Äôt remember too much after that other than it was def weird.

In the end things didn‚Äôt work out anyways, lost a friend, weird life moved on. Idk what I was thinking and I hope I never will. Next time I know what not to do tho. 

tl;dr told my friend my uncle died when really he never existed, so she‚Äôd find me less attractive and I could keep her in the friend-zone. Operation failed.",11,1,tifu

All along I meant to be saying ‚Äújack around‚Äù but my brain failed me.

t3_ktcm4a,TIFU by not cleaning out my purse,"TIFU by almost giving my manager a heart attack and embarrassed myself forever. 

Obligatory: I am on mobile, spelling, etc etc. Also this happened a couple months ago. 

For background: in retail stores the manager on duty (mod) will check your bag as you‚Äôre on your way out of the store at the end of your shift for loss prevention purposes. I was coming to an end in my assistant store manager role for a pretty large clothing company since I was going to enjoy the stay at home mom thing and go back to school. However, during one of my last days the bag check... it got me. 

I‚Äôm usually pretty good at keeping things out of my bag since I tend to just hoard things and never clean them out if I don‚Äôt do it immediately after I get home. One night the husband and I were feeling adventurous and purchased some ... toys. The thing is, we live with my parents and my mom tends to go into our space to ‚Äúclean‚Äù aka snoop and go through our stuff (I know, we‚Äôre working on moving out). So on this particular night we turned off our phones, went to the local shady sex store, shopped around like a bunch of teenagers, went to town on each other while enjoying some time away from our baby for one of the first times. It was great, however we didn‚Äôt get to use our new toys because we got carried away and when we got back home and parked we decided to just shove everything in my purse and went in. 

Well, I didn‚Äôt work for about four days since I was transitioning off full time work and in that time I didn‚Äôt go out so I didn‚Äôt even look in my purse. Read: I totally forgot they were in my bag. 

The next work shift, I went in, worked, everything went well and my manager and I are talking about how hard it‚Äôll be to deal with the upcoming season without an asm etc etc. The conversation got very emotional as we expressed how much we were going to miss each other. Then the conversation where my TIFU comes in: 

Manager: oh I‚Äôm the mod today, why don‚Äôt you bring your stuff up so you can clock out? 

Me: sure thing

So I very nonchalantly went to grab my stuff from my locker, my coat, etc. And went to show her. 

Oh. No. I remembered the *ahem* items just as I was unzipping my bag, now I could just refuse a bag check which would get me written up, or I could.... die on the inside and leave. 

I chose die on the inside and from her reaction I‚Äôm sure she did too. She peered into my bag and then looked up at me with big, wide eyes and muttered a ‚Äúyou‚Äôre good to go. Goodbye‚Äù 

Im just glad I didn‚Äôt kill this 63 year old woman from a heart attack. But after that I felt like I was dying and promptly dumped the items in a safe space when I got home. 

I saw her this weekend when I stopped by and my husband and I walked in and her eyes were really wide when she saw us and she looked at my bag ‚Äúinconspicuously‚Äù. 

So, yeah.

Two guys walk up to me and ask me if this is the train to station Oss (in broken English). I tell them it isn't and tell them I might be able to tell them which platform they need to be on.

Kinda sleepdrunk me forgot that I didn't use the current location but instead used the location of the previous train station.

So I open the app and navigate to the location they want to go to. I tell them to head to platform 5 where their train is which will leave in 5 minutes.
After they left I realized my mistake and walked to the door of the train but didn't see them anywhere, I couldn't come after them because my train was about to depart as well.

t3_ktazz3,TIFU by letting my boyfriend kiss me,"Have to apologise first, I'm writing this on mobile.

Some hours ago my boyfriend and I were messing around having fun. We were kissing and teasingly pulling each other's tongues until I suddenly felt something tear. I wasn't sure what it was until I felt pain in my mouth and tasted blood. My boyfriend didn't know what had happened so he just sat there while I stood up heading to the kitchen to get a glass of water. 

What's important to know is that I cannot see, taste or even smell my own blood. No idea why cause I've got no problem with helping other people when they are hurt. 

So while I'm in the kitchen I notice my vision starting to blur a bit. I know this stupid reaction my body has, so I walk to the living room and drop on the couch before it gets worse. The blurry vision doesn't seem to want to go away so I stay on the couch. Meanwhile my boyfriend has come to the couch and is asking me how he can help. I tell him to get a glass of water but, oh no, that was a big mistake. It just made the taste of blood explode in my mouth, making it even harder for me to stay calm. 

While I'm still sitting on the couch my dad comes back from grocery shopping. He doesn't notice anything wrong until he sees me and says ""you're extremely bleak, what's wrong?"". Me and my boyfriend try to explain, or more like my boyfriend on his own because my vision is getting even worse. My dad tells me to go to the bathroom and hold my wrist under the cold water. Normally, that does the trick. But this time my vision doesn't want to get better and now my ears are also starting to give up. I only hear my boyfriend and dad as if they are far far away. My dad is yelling at me about what's wrong and that it can't be that bad, but I don't really hear him. I walk back to the living room. But that was a bad idea. My legs start wobbling and I don't really notice anything around me. I can't walk straight anymore. 

If it wasn't for my dad, who had gone back to the living room before me, I would've crashed to the ground, unconscious, and probably hit my head hard enough to get a concussion. Or maybe even worse, I could've hit the side of the table. 
But luckily my dad caught me and placed me on the couch, legs up, shock position. Instantly my vision came back, my hearing improved and 
I was aware of my surroundings again. I stayed there, laying on the couch for about half an hour, my boyfriend behind me caressing my head, still concerned. It turns out I tore the frenulum of my tongue. Not as bad as it may sound - my frenulum is too short so maybe this even improved the length of my frenulum. I'll see that in some weeks.

So what I can say: if you are one of those people like me who doesn't cope well with his or her own blood, don't forget your ways of trying to convince your body that nothing's going on. It can be life saving. If I would've hit my head it could have had severe aftermath.


TL;DR Was kissing and messing around with my boyfriend when the frenulum of my tongue tore and I almost ended up going into shock due to my inability to see my own blood.",44,15,tifu
t3_ktazbo,"TIFU by lying a lot about myself to a close friend in my hometown, for a decade, and I don't know how to come clean.","tl;dr.
I've lied a lot about myself to a close friend in my hometown. I have a shit ton of guilt so I feel I should come clean. I want to tell them that I‚Äôm messed up in the head and I‚Äôm trying to get better. I just don't want to lose the best person from my childhood.


The friends that I made outside my home town, they know that I lie to their face, but they won't bring it up. 

Cause whenever there's hostility from outside the circle, I have their back big time.

That's one main reasons I think I still have the friends I made outside my home town.

I only recently had ego death and realised that I've been living vivid lies, and I didn't want to do that anymore.

Have been trying real hard for over a year to not lie to people I care about. 



I'm currently returned home and I'll hang out with this person this weekend.

Like my friends from outside my hometown, I'm sure this person also knows that I've lied to their face.

On top of that, they didn't get to see my better sides.

And overall, I have a shit ton of guilt so I feel I should 'fess up.




I‚Äôm not a textbook Narcissist.

I don‚Äôt talk bad about anyone, or put a person down. 

I just have a need to lie.

I concoct stories, jumble around parts of my life, play with the timeline, create a flow, add some extra pazzaz to make the story interesting. 

I convinced myself that it was all for entertainment and that I'm a pro story teller. 

I don‚Äôt even lie to improve my image, I don‚Äôt get any kick out of it, I feel like shit immediately after. But I just do it, like cruise control, my mouth just keeps moving.

/Nothing I‚Äôve said is a 100% true, and nothing is a 100% lie./

But I can't quote Technicality and strengthen my delusions. 

I don't know if there's anything I can say to make what I did any less messed up.

I understand that I have no right to play with people‚Äôs trust.

And I am pretty sure that this person will lose their trust in me, and will want no contact with me.

I'll accept that outcome.

I don‚Äôt want forgiveness or acceptance or support.

I want to tell them that I‚Äôm messed up in the head and I‚Äôm trying to get better. 

I need the benefit of doubt that I have the scope to get better. For whenever we meet down the road.

I just don't want to lose the best person from my childhood.

If that does happens, I'll cope with it.

But I don't want this to happen.

Moral : Don't lie to people you care about, or to yourself. I understand that reality isn't great, but lying and living in delusions is much worse, overtime.",13,4,tifu
t3_ktakk0,TIFU by getting the COVID vaccine,"Throwaway because job details and embarrassing story. Obligatory this happened on Monday, but my coworker just gave me the idea to tell you people about this embarrassing incident.¬†

I work in a hospital and was excited to find out that it was my turn to get the first vaccine dose. But¬†the night before, I received some family news that really threw me for a loop and I was emotionally devastated. The next morning, I was sleep deprived and still really shaken up, but I was determined to get that shot ASAP. This was a mistake. I have this thing called vasovagal syncope, which is when a trigger, usually intense emotions, needles, the sight of blood, etc., causes a rapid drop in blood pressure and leads to tunnel vision, cold sweats, nausea, and even loss of consciousness for a few seconds. It is not dangerous, and people are generally completely fine afterward. This has only popped up once or twice in my entire life (I passed out when getting my nose pierced, but that's about it lol). I am not afraid of needles at all. I work with needles and blood all the time; it is literally my job. But I guess the emotional exhaustion from the night before and the anticipation of getting the vaccine was too much. As soon as the needle went in, my vision darkened and I instantly felt light-headed. I recognized what was happening and knew that the episode would only last a few seconds if I lost consciousness, but I did not have enough time to tell the nurse this. So this room full of healthcare workers just sees this lady (me) get the covid vaccine and seconds later slump over in her chair. Of course, they're worried that I'm one of those poor bastards that's having an adverse reaction to the vaccine itself, and they spring into action. There's already a stretcher being wheeled in my direction a group of people surrounding me when I come to, and I groggily explain to everyone that no, I'm fine, I just need to chill out for a bit. The nurses, bless them, took amazing care of me anyway. They brought me snacks and water and would not let me leave until I felt 100% normal. This was all super embarrassing as not only were these people technically my coworkers, but I was also wearing an ID badge for a job position that should definitely not be held by someone that passes out in the presence of needles. I kept saying that this never happens and that I'm totally fine with needles, but I could tell they were skeptical. I will probably be an entertaining story told in break rooms for weeks to come.

TL;DR: My body decided that getting the covid vaccine would be an appropriate time to lose consciousness, healthcare workers freak out.¬†

But who cares, I got the vaccine, and I am so grateful that I got to get it as early as I did! Now both me and my patients are safer. When you get the opportunity, PLEASE get vaccinated. It is safe, effective, and *probably* won't make you pass out ;)¬†",82,14,tifu
t3_ktacrj,TIFU by ignoring the class action lawsuit regarding shampoo and conditioner.,"I am sure most of you have seen the lawsuit against basically every Walmart brand shampoo/conditioner.  I ignored looking at this for a long while because usually it is a bizarre scenario or doesn't pertain to me. Well, this one happens to include most of the shampoos and conditioners I use or have used regularly for years.

Back after high school I switched from the salon grade products to generic to cut costs some. At that time I still used hair dye pretty regularly. I just assumed I had damage from the dye itself, not the products I had started using. 

After both pregnancies I experienced hair loss when I quit breastfeeding, and I thought it was just the normal hormone changing hair loss and dismissed it.

I saw a post about Suave and disregarded it because I don't use it. Then I saw a few different ones and finally decided to look into it. Whoops!

So I switched back to the products I used to use, and seriously have used it once and can tell a difference. I can't believe for years I have been saving about $12 on shampoo and conditioner and have been losing my hair because of it! 



TLDR: switched from professional grade hair products to generic because it's cheaper- now there is a lawsuit against generic companies for hair loss. So, after saving some money and losing a significant amount of hair, I am now buying the professional products again.",4,2,tifu
t3_ktacok,Tifu by accidentally writing a suicide note,"This actually happened years and years ago when I was in fourth or fifth grade but I just remembered about it today so I thought I‚Äôd share. You see, I used to live in a town just outside of St. Louis Missouri, so we were on the very edge of tornado alley. For some reason I developed a strange fascination and fear of tornadoes. I was paranoid, I still get paranoid. Even if there was only a slight thunderstorm, I‚Äôd be terrified that there would be a tornado, and throughout my childhood and time living there, I had many nightmares about tornadoes that I still remember to this day. Now that you understand my slightly irrational phobia of tornadoes, this takes place one day at my elementary school. the sky was so dark that it felt like night, and I was in class and could see out the windows at the rain pouring and the lightning and the sky becoming an ominous green color. I wasn‚Äôt paying attention because I was so anxious about the possibility of a tornado on its way. Because of this, my child brain had nothing better to do than write a will, just in case I died in the tornado that I was positive was coming. I wrote the will on a notecard which probably went along the lines of ‚Äòmy dog goes to my parents, my iPad goes to my little brother, everything else goes to my best friend, goodbye cruel cruel world.‚Äô Yes, I was a very dramatic child. Long story short, no tornado came, at least not that day, and by the end of school the storm had let up and everything was fine. Obviously then, I wasn‚Äôt going to die so I no longer needed the will. I recycled the notecard.  A day or so passed when I get called into the counselors office. I had no idea what this was about, for context I was barely aware of what suicide even was at this point in my life. She showed me the notecard and told me that someone had found it in the recycling bin and if I knew what it was. At this point was relived I wasn‚Äôt in trouble even though I didn‚Äôt understand what was wrong, so I laughed. She told me she was relived I was laughing and I told her the story. That‚Äôs basically it, not the most climactic story but for sure embarrassing to look back on.

Back in July or August, I decided to try this infamous website that allows you to talk to strangers. Lo and behold, I was matched with this interesting guy. We talked for about an hour and decided we'll continue talking on a different platform. It was going great except that we're in different countries and we can't meet personally - which eventually turned out to be a good thing now.

Our entire interaction is obviously online. At the start, we used to talk every single day and as you might have already expected, after some time, we started fooling around. However, at some point our messages became sporadic. There were times that we wouldn‚Äôt speak for a week, or even for a month. I‚Äôm cool and didn‚Äôt think too much of it. In my head, we‚Äôre adults and there are adult things that we need to do.

Then last night just before I went to bed, I received a message from him. I decided to sleep and to open it the next day.

t3_kt9sp6,TIFU by having the confidence of an extremely average white man," 

Last week, I wanted to print something at home. That's when it became apparent that my printer ran out of colored ink. Me, being a cheap ass eastern european, was not about to waltz down to the local store to buy new cartridges that at this point are more expensive than my whole damn printer, so I ordered printer ink from Amazon. Refilling a printer cartridge is not rocket science after all, right?

My order arrived today and on with it I went. I pull out the cartridge, got a syringe, squirted some ink into the cartridge and back in the printer it went. To nobody's shock but my own, the printer still wouldn't print. What is one to do in a situation like this but turn it off and on again? After that failed, I started googling the error message I was getting. ""What to do when \*insert printer make and model\* gives error 5200?"" As more time passed and more obscure the message boards I was visiting, the more esoteric the solutions became. 3 hours later, 15 restarts in, after sacrificing 2 goats and promising Cthulhu he can have my first born, the printer was still not printing.

As I was contemplating whether human sacrifice could aid me in my quest of obtaining a picture of a non-monochrome cat, my husband suggested maybe the old ink inside the cartridge dried up, and the dried flakes keep getting stuck inside the slit the ink is supposed to come out of, which explains why the printer won't print in color but it occasionally leaks colored ink.

I was ready to try anything and frankly, emptying and washing out the entire cartridge was slightly less extreme than human sacrifice so I decided to give it a try. I pulled the cartridge out, took it to the bathroom sink, filled up my 10 ml syringe with water, put it into the yellow ink holding part of the cartridge, pushed the plunger and nothing happened. Nothing happened? Nothing happened!

That's when it dawned on me that I fucked up so spectacularly a doctor might need to check me over. You know, to make sure I'm not currently suffering from some sort of brain damage I was unaware of. The printer, dear reader, wasn't printing because I added, give or take, 3 ml of ink. 3 instead of the roughly 17 it takes to fill up the cartridge... which is why nothing happened when I emptied the water into the cartridge rather than in overflowing as I was expecting.

I spent half a day trying to fix, to no avail, a non-existent problem because I failed to consider, that perhaps, that thing I never did before... I did wrong. Not for a second did I stop and think to myself: ""Maybe the reason this printer that was out of color ink, isn't printing in color, because I, the person who refilled the cartridge, refiled it wrong.""

Today, if nothing else, will serve as evidence to all my future therapists that while I might be a basket case with innumerable issues, nobody can ever accuse me of lacking self-confidence ever again. In fact, it is now plainly obvious that I have the same amount of unearned and unwarranted self-confidence that most of my male peers are just naturally blessed with.

TL;DR  I didn't put enough ink into the printer cartridge and went on to waste half a day unable to figure out why the printer won't print, simply because I failed to consider I could have fucked up refilling the printer cartridge.",88,7,tifu

t3_kt8dcm,"TIFU by not stretching my legs, causing me to blackout while trying to use the bathroom."," 

So I have a god awful amount of health issues. I'm not sure if it's because I was a really premature baby, or if I just lost the genetic lottery, but ever since I was a child I've struggled with chronic pain and illness. Unfortunately, much of that time was spent with doctors not believing the severity of things, telling me that I was overexaggerating or that it was growing pains, so the few coping skills I do have are not always effective, much less so than being on a medication or treatment plan.

Today's two relevant issues are chronic joint problems and probable endometriosis. I have pain in nearly every joint in my body, they're often stiff, and in the case of my knees, they frequently pop out of place, causing extreme pain. While I'm still working out the endo stuff with a doctor, to avoid TMI one of the biggest problems is for some reason my bladder will randomly scream at me telling me to go pee, whether or not I actually have to go. This is was one of those times.

I'm chilling on my computer, trying to get some school done, when the alarms start ringing. So, instead of stretching my legs slowly and massaging them into working order like I usually do, I stand up and waddle to the bathroom, trying to ignore the shooting pains down my stiff legs and avoiding stepping on my cat who absolutely loves the bathroom. I sit down to do my business and this is where I fuck up. My knees, at the same time, crack out of place. It's hard to describe what it feels like, but imagine someone taking a hammer to both knees, followed by a sound like a very large nut being cracked. Of course, I was only vaguely aware of the noise because at this point I'm, already dizzy from the pain and my vision is quickly fading.

An unknown amount of time later, I'm guessing less than a minute based on previous blackouts, I wake up on the floor, in a puddle of my own pee, cat losing her mind on the sink above me. Thank god I missed the drawers beneath the sink because what a fucking *great* time explaining that to an ER doctor while getting stitches would be. I'm calling to get in with my PCP and scheduling physical therapy now.

TL;DR: Didn't stretch before going to use the bathroom. Knees ended up cracking, resulting in me passing out from the pain, almost peeing on my cat in the crossfire because she's clingy and wanted to play in the sink.",10,1,tifu
t3_kt83c2,TIFU by getting caught hiding my dad's porn CD in my textbook,"So this happened a few hours ago and with no other option I thought of sharing this story with the fellow internet people and make myself feel embarrassed...

Few days ago when I was high off my ass and was sparked with the idea of going through my parents closest for some reason and find whether the house that they owned was transferred to my name..... I honestly donno why I thought this but I did.... So I open the closest and reach my hand far in and I find a plastic cover filled with something.... I took it out and saw it was a yellow cover and I open it find a butt load of CD's.... Now my curiosity peaked and grabbed one of the CDs and forgot for what reason I had come for.... Surprise surprise I find ""sexy busty ladies"", on the cd with a rather hot looking girl with her bossoms hanging in a open field.... They seemed like a generic brand of CD's with stickers of women flaunting all over... I mean I did know my father was rather pervert in nature but didn't know he actually had some rather interesting choice of porn collection....

Some people know that sex drives are rather common when a person is high and this is what I exactly I should have got for me to pleasure myself while being high...
So I grabbed one of the CDs and put it in my laptop and had my most profound fap....

For some reason nothing spectacular actually happened and the day went on as is... This happened last Monday by the way and I took the CD I masturbated to and hid it inside one of textbooks that was lying around.... And proceeded to keep the book in the book shelf where I had left my books in a messy manner... 

Should have relized that I shouldn't have left my books in such a way but I didn't because again I was high... 
And my mom had to observe this and had to come herself to clean the book rack herself this very day when I was home...

I knew something was wrong somewhere and had a sixth sense that something was about to happen as my mom for my bad luck was going through my book shelf because she wanted to keep it in a tidy manner.... I knew I had left something there but couldn't quite catch it in my head what it was....

So I panicked and went as fast as I could and I heard a thing fall on the ground as I came down the stairs ( our floor is made of wood and had no carpet btw).... And there it lied in front of me and my mom....
 "" Japanese young erotica*

t3_kt81t5,TIFU by buying a couch the same color as my cat.," 

A local furniture mart was having a blowout sale, so we finally were able to get rid of our old ""parent surplus"" couch for something made in this century.

But it just so happens we also have a cat - a fat, spoiled orange-brownish lump we adopted from a local shelter. And his fur color happens to be EXACTLY the same as our new couch, especially if all the living room lights aren't on. Within 24 hours of bringing it home he happily claimed it as his new favorite napping spot, while we've nearly sat on him so many times we've lost count.

The nature of the sale means the couch is nonreturnable, and my wife would literally murder me in my sleep if I got rid of the cat, whom she loves very much. So we're going to be stuck doing ""seat checks"" for a very long time.

Be thankful you're so cute, cat!

t3_kt7l9k,Tifu by almost ruining the holidays with an inappropriate picture,"NSFW for obvious reasons

Obligatory this didn't happen to me today but rather on Christmas morning 2020. 

It was the first Christmas my girlfriend and I really got to do it up. Our son was around 15 months old at the time so we wanted to make it really special for him. 

For fear that he would start unwrapping the brightly colored shiny boxes under the tree, we decided to stash all of the presents in a spare room we have. The plan was to wake up extra early on Christmas morning, put all the presents under the tree, and wait for him to wake up.

Well the plan went off without a hitch. We woke up super early and got everything taken care of in about 15 minutes. It is now 6:45 AM and son is still out cold. I decided to go try and lay down to catch another 20-30 minutes of sleep, and my gf wanted to wait up for the kid. 

This is where it starts to go downhill. I go and lay down, but I quickly realize that I will not be going back to sleep. So I think to myself maybe we can have a little early morning ""roll in the hay"" if you will. So I decided that I'm gonna send m'lady a dick pic.

Now I, being the mostly out of touch millennial that I am, don't use snapchat that often. But I do know that people often use it to send nudes. Therefore, I decided to channel my inner young person and take care of this with modern technology.

After a few attempts I finally got what I thought was a pretty nice dick pic. Good lighting, angle, you guys know what I'm talkin about. I then add the words ""You want some Christmas dick?"" to the snap. 

While reviewing placement of the words, I decided that it wasn't festive enough. At first I thought there might be a Christmas light sticker, but I settled on a bow.

Here is the problem with being an old millennial and almost never using snapchat. I was looking around for the button that adds a sticker to the picture. Ya know that little button in the bottom left corner that looks like a little square with a + in the corner? Well my brain was like, oh hey that looks like an add sticker button. I tapped the button and it was gone. My glorious tribute to my manhood had zoomed off to lands unknown and I had no idea where. 

Immediately I started panicking. I quickly checked my story but I didn't see anything. Then I replicated what I had done but with a picture of the wall instead. Pressed the same button and ""poof"" it was gone. I then went back to my story and.... there it was. In all of its triumphant glory. 

Luckily, the view counter still said ""0"" and luckier still, I somehow knew how to delete a snapchat from your story. Just as quickly as it had come in to this world it was taken out. 

After my heartbeat reached a semi normal rate, I decided to get back in the saddle again and re do my masterpiece. Mission successful. After a good laugh with my gf, we ended up having a nice pre Christmas morning. 

I know the view counter said 0. But I wonder if someone, who was hoping to see pictures of our son on Christmas morning, opened my story. Only to be met with a very festive dick pic. Nobody has said anything yet so I guess we will see.

And now, every once in awhile, my head will randomly say ""want some Christmas dick?"" and I burst out laughing.

Tldr: almost ruined Christmas by posting a festive dick pick to my snap story.

Edit: Thank you for the gold! It's my first time getting some.",42,5,tifu
t3_kt65rk,"TIFU on my Vacation Trip to The Capital Building [Long, TLDR at bottom]","Obligatory, this happened late December of 2017, but recent events made me think about posting this here.

This happened when my wife and I took our 2 boys on a little vacation in December 2017. We rented a 21' camper trailer and drove up from Florida through the Smokies and up to a campsite in New Jersey. On Christmas we went to New York City and had a relatively good time, despite being Floridians who didn't know how to deal with the cold.

After a couple days in New York, we had a tour of the Capital Building, so we made the decision to leave the camper in our spot at the camp site and drive to DC and back all in the same day- manageable, but a little stressful.

That morning after struggling to get our boys (ages 9mo. and 5 years) and ourselves ready to go, we realized we're kinda cutting it close on time- we have the last tour of the day and we need to book it to get there.

This is where I fucked up- I skipped my morning ""movement"" to make sure we'd leave on time, surely they'd have restrooms I could use somewhere along the way. After stopping to get gas on the way off of the turnpike, I checked the restroom and lo and behold, a line maybe 7 men long... I'd have to wait to take the Browns to the Superbowl until DC...

So after hours of driving, thanks to traffic we just barely made it to DC with what seems like JUST enough time to make it into the tour, and now my stomach went from uncomfortable to sharp cramps and PAIN. I've never had to poop so bad it HURT like this. Now we're trying to find a place to park and I'm getting MAD and my wife is trying to tell me where to go, all places that are either too far from the Capital Building or the lots are full- I tried to take some turns down streets near the building only to get turned around by Capital Police.

All the while I'm really yelling at my wife and being mean, she's laughing hysterically at me (letting my mean comments go because she knows my situation, bless her heart). I'm telling her I'm gonna just ditch the car on the side of the road for her to deal with while I run into the nearest building, but decide against it. Finally we realize we can park in congressional parking lot because there's no business being conducted that day.

As we're putting the boys' layers on, she informs me, ""The website said no strollers, by the way, we have to carry (our younger son) and carry only what we need... Great. Not only am I pinching my balloon knot as hard as I can to keep my brownie mix while struggling with winter layers on me and the boys that are completely foreign to a Floridian, now I have to physically exert myself more to carry him! And guess what, my puffer jacket is as slick as teflon! If I put him on my hip, he slides RIGHT OFF! Now it's 100% arm strength as we dash what seems like a mile to the entrance on the OTHER side of the building, and what-do-you-know? Strollers... Strollers everywhere. FFS, can this be any worse?

I'm about to explode, my leather cheerio is being subjected to pressures rivaled only by the eruption of Vesuvius. We inquire about the tour and they tell us ""you're probably too late, but there's the line"" Gesturing towards the 60 people with strollers and casual attitudes that only serves to infuriate me more. While in line, my wife mentions that she forgot her ID... Surely you can't get into THE Capital Building without and ID. I was just about to say ""FUCK IT"" and run off to a shitter somewhere, when the line starts to move and figure we might make it.

Finally make it inside and it is TOASTY - but now we have to go through security - we need to remove all of our jackets and everything, place it on the x-ray conveyor and walk through with our boys. OK, easy enough, right? Well not for someone who's not used to winter clothes, and DOESN'T HAVE A STROLLER. So now I'm walking through the scanner holding my youngest and my pants are falling down because I have no belt, and we're onto the other side, thankfully they didn't ask for IDs and we've seemingly made it. Now we're inside, but we have a whole HEAP of coats and jackets that its far too warm to put back on... so what do we do?

My wife came up with the good idea to just stuff it all into the baby's winter-suit (I forget the proper name) and that actually works, albeit it now looks like we have 3 children. Mind you, my stink-wrinkles are still under siege - but we're in, and we're coming up with solutions. The tour begins, I'm carrying our baby boy, and swinging around what LOOKS like another infant carelessly under my arm, and sweating.. Sweating profusely. Sweating so much that it's running down the crack of my ass and now I'm thinking there's a 50/50 chance I already lost- that my sphincter gave way to a mudslide. I'm so nervous that I try REALLY hard not to stand in front of anybody, lest they catch a whiff. Levels of uncomfortable I never imagined were possible.

The tour heads into a theater where they play a short movie - I couldn't tell you what it was about - ""THANK GOD"" I thought, SOME sort of reprieve from the misery that is my life right now - I can sit down!! - and maybe smell if something has in fact gone awry, cause up til now I'm just relying on my wife to tell me if she smells anything, but she's been laughing at me so hard I don't know if she even know's whats happening anymore.

Only our youngest didn't like the movie apparently, because as I sat down he began to cry... and cry loudly... Okay, I can do this.. just get up.. just walk around, he'll be okay and I can go sit down again... Up and down the whole showing, and my wife has tears in her eyes at this point... She's laughing so hard that she'd probably go weak at the knees if she tried to hold our boy, so I continue suck it up.

After what seemed like a showing of the Titanic, the tour continues and we're again, only now since we were at the back of the theater, we're at the front of the line, and I'm just trying to gauge people's reactions near me. Surely if they smelled my shit, they'd make some sort of sour face, yeah? As we're walking, I finally feel some sort of relief, like my body decided to give me a break and my colon just ""sucked it up"" for a bit, so despite my sweaty ass-crack, life is somewhat bearable, and I finally realize, hey, this is kinda cool, I'm in a really historic building here! Look at the art and stuff!

Maybe 15 min into the tour though, our youngest begins to cry and now he just hasn't stopped... and our 5 year old is getting a little impatient as he doesn't think a whole lot of what's going on as little kids tend to do... so we decide to finally just break it off and leave - only we're in the middle of the Capital Building and we have no idea where to go - we're going up and down stairs and getting turned around by velvet ropes and I'm asking every staffer I see where the nearest restroom is -

Finally we make it to the toilets and I hand off the baby and dart inside. It's a pretty full house in there, but there's an empty stall - I dart in and as I'm pulling my jeans, my thermals, and my underwear down, I feel it coming. No sooner do my cheeks hit the seat that the Hershey Highway unleashes Hell - Unashamedly disgusting every other man in that bathroom, and probably anyone within earshot in the hallway. Normally I'd courtesy flush, but it's all happening so fast that the thought totally escapes me. I deposit so much crude oil that there's a mountain in the toilet that it brings up feelings of nostalgia - to the first time I saw Jurassic Park when Laura Dern was elbow-deep in it.

There's so much relief I feel like I'm having a moment of clarity and realize how mean I'd been to my wife and I legit felt really bad about it. After taking a picture, then flushing and washing up and walking out as fast as possible (I'm sure it clogged) I walk out and apologize to my wife. She was super understanding and honestly found it funny as hell, so no harm done.

This became known as **The Crapital Hill incident**, and we still have a big chuckle about it from time-to-time.

t3_kt5gqa,TIFU by teaching rhymes to my 4yo.,"This happened 2 hours ago and is still on going. My daughter and I sat down for breakfast. She wanted me to sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. So i did. She requested it again and again. 

I knew where this was going so i changed up the lyrics. She was taken by surprise and laughed and we started going back and fourth rhyming words. 

Long story short i ended up rhyming a word with ""fart"" and she laughed and laughed. It is the most she had laughed in a while. So I did it again to even more laughter. So she tried and we both laughed.  

Well. Now she thinks she has the ultimate key to comedy. She has been singing and ""telling jokes"" for the past two hours. 

The latest version is: ""Twinkle twinkle little zebra, how I wonder fart fart fart.""

The last joke went something like: ""Why did the elephant drive a car? Because the cat farted and it smelled like a fart.""

I told her that her joke stinks and she snorted. Her retort? ""Because a fart came out of my mouth."" To which I said ""Eww"" and laughed... which only seems to have emboldened her stand-up routine. 

TLDR: I rhymed a word with ""fart"", now the 4 year old is rhyming everything with fart and telling fart jokes.",442,43,tifu
t3_kt5dmj,TIFU by accidently showing a colleague a dick pic,"I had more or less surpressed this embarrassing moment, until I read another FU today with a guy showing his family a video of him and his girlfriend... as you might have guessed, this happened years ago but its still painful to think about!

So when I was younger I liked to take photos/videos of me and my girlfriend during sexy times, unfortunately around the same time we were days away from moving in together. We had recently visited the house and took plenty of pictures - you can probably see where this is going...
I was on a late shift at work with ""Bob"", we had worked together for a few years and got on well, occasionally going out for drinks etc on the weekend. This day was like any other, we were chatting about random things when I mentioned the house. I pulled my phone out to show him some pictures, I had them on fullscreen, slowly swiping through them ""Here's the garden, the garage is full of old junk, front room is decent.."" Awkward silence ""I... umm.. shit"". I swiped across to a picture of my girlfriend with her mouth full of.. well, me..

We both sort of froze for a few seconds while we processed what we were looking at, he just said ""are you fucking serious?!"" and walked off! As I said, we got along well but I was terrified of him reporting me. He came back a few minutes later and just said ""I can't believe you just did that"", I said how sorry I was but the damage was done.
After that night there was always a bit of awkwardness between us, we didn't go out on the weekends again but he didn't report me or mention it to anyone (that I know of). He left the company for another job about a year later.

I haven't seen him since but I wonder what he would say if we bumped into each other now...

(Stopped to interject - I worked as an ambassador for a company (lol) and she oversaw the program.  I quit pretty quick into it, and she was let go before that, but we followed each other and were on pretty good terms).  She had reposted a post from a gym where there was going to be a free class.  The class was on rowing (my sport), and featured a (tagged) picture of a cute rower.  

My first FU was assuming that she just wanted to spread awareness of the class.  The second, and much larger FU, was being too bold.  I believe in DMing guys first (why not??), so I clicked on his profile, saw he was private, and messaged him to say, ""I saw you on Instagram (bonus for being a rower) and I just wanted to say you're super cute :)) have a great day).  

As any great texter does, he replied about an hour later and said ""Hi *shouldidrophim*, thank you I appreciate that!  My girlfriend X thinks so too, I think you knew her from Y!  I hope you're having a good 2021 so far, have a great day yourself""

I just moved across the country so I‚Äôm not used to my surroundings at all. I had to go to a town about 45 minutes south of where I live to get to a discount tire for a flat repair. 

Well. Being the kind and considerate person that I am, I took my 4 kids, ages 7 5 3 and 1, outside to play because it wasn‚Äôt bitter cold and there wasn‚Äôt snow. Big mistake. My 5 year old and 3 year old are still figuring out balance and developing a distaste for being wet.

My 5 year old was less obvious in his jeans, but the 3 year old was wearing very light pink leggings. The cashiers at sams club were completely appalled at the appearance of my 3 year old‚Äôs behind.

t3_kt3krl,"TIFU: By trying to show off to the wife, and buying an eighty dollar glass of whiskey.","My wife, best friend and I had a great weekend planned.  This was in the late 90's, and on Friday night, we went to see Dave Matthews Band at the Nissan Pavilion (Now Jiffy Lube Live), and Saturday night, my buddy had gotten us tickets for an acoustic Prince show at the incredible Warner Theater in DC.

He bought the tickets for us, and I was to reimburse him, so I took out enough cash from the ATM to pay him back for me and my wife, and to have some for a little pre-gaming at the Old Ebbitt Grill on Saturday night.

While we were waiting for him to finish up in the kitchen (He was a chef there) I sat at the bar, and thought I would impress my wife by ordering a glass of ""Their best whiskey, neat"".  The bartender poured out a nice glass of whiskey, waited for me to drink it down, and said ""That'll be $80.""

Feeling sheepish, I handed over the cash, plus tip (didn't have a credit card at the time, and I had maxed out my ATM withdrawal limit for the night, and this was before most places were set up to take payment from debit cards), so I no longer had enough to repay my friend. 

So by trying to be a big shot, I ended up screwing my friend (I got him back the next day, but it sucked that night) and my wife was definably NOT impressed, and our post concert plans were ruined.

  
Well, at least the concert was the best one I've ever been to, so I had that going for me...even if I felt like a butthead.

So I wasn't really looking for sleep yesterday night. I was gonna play some league but then I had to reinstall it because there was some error with the files. And because of the internet here on the Philippines, it took a long time (I really can't remember how much it took). So to pass the night, I drank a cup of coffee. Eventually it installed but it was already 5 am. And my mother wakes up at 4 and she wakes all of us by 8. And I know she'd be angry if she knew I was awake all night so I slept for like 3 hours (short of 6 hours of an average adolescent). And to stay awake because I needed to do chores, I drank 2 cups of coffee.Even with the amount of coffee in my system, I slept from 9 to 11 just before lunch (my mother woke me up).

 Fast forward to 3. I was really hungry and was looking for something to eat. I was used to baking my own merienda but my dumb self thought it would be good to make not just one type of ""frappe"" but two. And I had two glasses each. I even made a caramel sauce for each. Anyways my younger brother wanted to play with me so I did. Until I realized I was easily running out of breath. I blamed it on my lack of sleep. Then I watched a video explaining why Geometry Dash was not a rhythm game. This may not seem relevant but I blamed that for my headache. I wanted to sleep but I couldn't. Then I started to vomit. And then it hit me. Caffeine overdose. After searching it up, I found out I had two out of three (the site may be wrong, it's the internet after all) - with the last one being shock. It also said that caffeine can be lethal (I may have misunderstood that) when taken in large doses. Now I'm sitting here posting this on Reddit because I think some people could help me out here, or maybe not. I'm also not the type to drink coffee.

This was late last night by the way-

For context, my aunt is one of those deep seated God fearing women that views anything outside of rainbows and ponies with even a hint of ""evil"" as ""satanic"" trash that needs to be purged from the earth- you know, basically anything in movies and games that normal people would consider fun.

Luckily the family I live isn't all that religious eithe like me but nonetheless this all started because I was interested in getting into the Warhammer universe, I had very little knowledge of the lore so I was just casually scrolling youtube looking through various videos on the subject.

I'm generally the type of person who when I am really into something, I don't usually pay attention to what's going on around me, that's probably where I actually fucked up.

My aunt for whatever reason decided to visit us and she is also the type of person to be shove her big fat nose into whatever everyone is doing.

After she talked with a few other of my family members that were here at the time and got into their business, she eventually got around to me and that's where shit hit the metaphorical fan.

Like I said earlier when I'm really invested into learning something I don't really pay attention to anything else, so I wasn't really concerned at the time about my aunt's presence and was watching a video about exterminatus- this video to be exact: https://youtu.be/ubNqUyf0op0

My aunt, to say the least was not pleased when she, quite rudely may I add stuck her giant nose into my phone and saw the cult imagery and the daemons featured in the video.

Without even giving me time to explain she immediately started yelling obscenities and saying incomprehensible things about blasphemy and how I was being tainted by the devil and my immortal soul was in danger and basically that my entire family would burn in hell because of me. I'm not particularly good at standing up for myself in person but after a few moments of my aunt's bullshit, a few of the not so religious family members I live with had enough of her and basically kicked her out of the house after a bit of arguing outside they all told her to leave and not come back. Cut to early this morning I wake up to find that my aunt's side of the family had blocked practically everyone on my side that was present at the time on every social media site they used and basically labeled us and damned and devil worshippers all because I just wanted to learn a little Warhammer lore.

t3_kszgjf,TIFU: Realizing I've been missing out on picturing things in my mind my entire life.,"TLDR at the bottom.

First-time poster in this sub. So I'm scrolling per usual, as one does at 4:30 AM. Been poking around Reddit for a few hours and come to this TIFU post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c4i94n/tifu\_by\_explaining\_my\_synesthesia\_to\_my\_boyfriend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c4i94n/tifu_by_explaining_my_synesthesia_to_my_boyfriend/)

Summary of that post: OP explains to her boyfriend about her synesthesia, realizes he has aphantasia and can't picture anything in his mind. Apparently, he's very upset.

Back to the present: Now, at 4:30 AM I'm very, very upset. I didn't know y'all got pictures in your minds, with full color and the like?! What the heck! I do not have that, so apparently, I have this aphantasia thing I didn't know existed.

Just woke my boyfriend up to ask if he can picture an apple instantly with full color, and yes, he can. He thinks I'm a weirdo for not being able to. He went back to sleep. I've been asked to picture things my whole life, as one does. I just think really hard about the words being asked, and still, darkness or I just continue staring at the scenery in the room. Always thought it was strange but went with it. Just thought it was a concentration/focus thing like make-believe. Didn't think you could SEE THINGS if you thought about them! I can't picture my house or my parents in my mind or anything at all. I didn't know anyone else could! Yes, I recognize things/people if I see them, but I can't picture them at all!

When I go to the dentist for cavities, my dentist tells me to picture wherever I want to be instead and close my eyes. So the entire time I'm at the dentist I always think ""pretty flower field"" over and over in my head, just sitting there with my eyes closed in blackness. Did I think it was weird? Yes. Did it distract me? Yes. But the rest of you can just teleport your mind to pretty scenery all the time?! I don't even fully believe it I'm so confused. Mad googling for the next few hours. I feel like I'm hyperventilating.

On a much smaller scale (maybe?) I feel like this is what people with color blindness feel like when they realize what they're missing?!

After starting my crazy googling, I realize some people with this mind blankness can't dream, but I do have vivid, image dreams. So I guess I have that going for me. I just didn't know most people could picture things whenever they wanted.

Apologies in advance if this post makes other people realize what they're missing. I'm so freaked out.

TLDR: After reading another TIFU I realized y'all can see memories and images in your mind and not just darkness or the normal room's scenery when thinking about something or closing your eyes. Sorry I sound so freaked out but I am crushed.

EDIT 1: Apparently, my mother has it too. She didn't know she had it, either. Dad can picture things perfectly fine. Research says they think it may have a genetic component, so there's that.",120,83,tifu

t3_ksyzu1,TIFU eating an unknown chili,"TIFU - well not actually today, but the poor guy drinking peppermint oil to relieve his stomach ache made me think of this episode from a couple of years ago.

My wife and I had a friend couple over for dinner and were sitting talking after dinner, playing board games and having a laugh and a few beers.

Introducing a case of ""boys will be boys"" and me remembering that we had a bag of mixed chilli peppers in the fridge. The chilis were grown by my wife's colleague and handed to us in a neutral bag containing a mix of different kinds. Some were relatively mild... Others not so much.

My friend and I decided to do a chili taste. Starting out with a brownish one, that was hot, but with a nice taste.

Afterwards we decided to go for a small red curly looking one. We googled and it looked like a carolina reaper - at the time the hottest chili in the world.
 We cut it in half and - bottoms up - ate a half each...

Quickly regretting that decision.

I started sweating and my mouth was on fire, but I stayed in my seat and handled it relatively well. My friend instantly started hicouging, drank like a liter of milk to soothe the pain and within minutes was on his knees making his offerings to the gods in the great porcelain bowl with a built in flush.

The evening kind of died and our friends went home. My pain recided and I went to bed with my wife.

Fast forward about an hour and a half, I wake up with a stomach ache and try to go to the toilet. Long story short, a few minutes later I'm curled up on the floor in the fetal position clutching my stomach with the worst stomach ache I've ever experienced, calling for my wife.

It feels like my bowels have exploded and I'm dying.

My wife calls for an ambulance, I'm picked up, taken to hospital and kept over night for observation. Of course nothing's actually wrong and hhey sent me home the next day - picked up by my parents in law ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Besides the stomach ache and my ass being on fire, when taking a dump the next three days no dumbasses were hurt in the making of this story.

t3_ksyncv,"TIFU by giving in to a panhandler at a bus station, which only escalated the situation","Well this isn't nearly as interesting as most stuff on this sub, but maybe my stupidity will make you laugh or something idk.

Yesterday I took a trip to my college from last semester to retrieve my items from the dorm room since I won't be staying there anymore, meaning I'm returning with a lot of baggage (three suitcases, a duffel bag, and a backpack, to be exact)

So after a long Greyhound bus ride, I arrived at the final stop and carted my luggage inside, wary of my surroundings as those stations are notoriously sketchy.

Once inside, I began searching for a rideshare to my hotel, at which point a man approaches me and says that he desperately needs $12 to help pay for his luggage on his bus ride. Having brought many bags myself, I felt bad that he would most likely miss his ride if he couldn't bring his luggage, being a fraction of the actual ride cost.

So I gave in and since I only had $20s, he gave me $8 change for one. However, he then starts begging me for the $5 bill back to buy food, which kind of caught me off guard because I was hoping he would leave me alone after already receiving a (decently) sizeable donation from me. I was hoping that he would appreciate what I gave him and that it would help in a meaningful way without giving me a guilt trip about not giving enough.

At this point I'm conflicted as I don't want to reward straight begging, but at the same time feel terrible that this man may not even get a meal for awhile. However my mind starts to panic, and I sort of freeze up and just try to avoid talking to him despite the incessant pandering.

He eventually walks away, but when I get outside to wait for my Lyft he returns to continue pandering between compliments and various emotional pleas. He even asks things like ""is that your ride?"", assumedly to guilt trip me for having it better off than him. At times he acted quite friendly, but by this point I felt it was too late to really do anything meaningful, and the best idea was just to ignore and gtfo.

That ride was a few hours ago, so I should be sleeping for my early morning flight, but for some reason here I am up at night giving myself a mental beating for somehow managing to being both a sell-out and not good enough simultaneously.

TL:DR; Felt bad for a panhandler at a bus station, gave him money for luggage but he asked for more to cover food, followed me around until I could leave, currently feeling bad that I did both too much and not enough.",6,5,tifu
t3_ksu9iw,TIFU by sleeping really sweaty next to my gf,"Obligatory this happened last night, she's with me while I type this.

Last night she (27F) made me (25M) dinner after a long walk and put up a movie for us to watch. It was getting late, we were getting sleepy and she offered I could stay at her (parent¬¥s) place for the night. With the promise of some spooning in my head, I agreed. We closed the computer after the movie was done and turned off the lights. It was the first time I was sleeping in at her parents, though we had already slept before many times, so we are really comfortable with each other. 
In the middle of the night, I abandoned the cuddling position because I was feeling really sweaty. I remember dreaming about running in an Atlantis lookalike world. I was escaping some menace and suddenly the walls of the city broke and I began drowning in a gigantic mass of water. This is where I fucked up. Still feeling really sweaty and the bed kinda humid I felt the sheets with my hands and realized it was everywhere, and not only the sheets but my underwear. Fuck. I had pissed myself.

Fortunately, she is the best so I woke her up.

""Hey, PissGf's GF, wake up. I think I just pissed myself"".

She let out a little laugh and said it was ok. We got up at five AM to change everything. Her parents were in the other room so we tried to be as silent as posible. I then dreamed of trying to get out of her place next morning only to find her mother to be really PISSED at me, cause she had somehow found out. 
I stayed the night and she woke me with breakfast on bed. When I saw her entre the room with coffe I promptly tol her that I had shat myself just for the giggles and we laughed for a while. It seems like its going to be a recurring gag...

t3_kswlk4,TIFU by accidentally letting my dog eat a grape.,"This is my first time posting in this sub but this just happened today and I wanted to share it.

So about 1 hour ago I was chillin on my couch eating some grapes and playing some Mario Odyssey. My dog was lying down next to me at my feet when suddenly I hear him chewing something. He usually is a picky dog so I was surprised to hear this. When I bent down to check what he was eating he immediately swallowed it. I guessed it was a grape and thought nothing of it. Then about 5 minutes later I check if dogs can eat grapes and they are VERY TOXIC especially to smaller dogs (my dog is a corgi). I immediately get concerned and call a animal hospital to see what I can do. They call me and tell me to come in immediately so they can make him vomit. After taking him to the animal hospital the total was 300$ and he is okay now.

TL;DR: I accidentally dropped a grape and my dog ate it which led to a 300$ hospital bill.",15,5,tifu
t3_ksunak,TIFU by drinking a whole pot of coffee before a long run.,"TIFU, well actually a couple days ago, and thought someone might need to laugh at my expense.  

I ended the year, New Years Eve to be exact, with my longest run of all time: 8 miles.  I know it's not a lot for some people but it's a huge deal for me.  I felt great after, and planned to beat that on my very next run 2 days later. This is where my FU begins.

I woke up a bit sluggish and started my day with a few more cups of coffee than normal (close to a whole pot).  Once I completed the usual morning activities I began my normal warmup routine, feeling really good as I begin my goal of 8.5 Miles.

The first 3 miles are going great, I feel light on my feet and keeping a good pace.  Things begin to deteriorate quickly from here.

Mile 4:  I get that feeling in my stomach, that grumble and turn.  The coffee is beginning to rear its evil side effects.  I tell myself to forget about it and continue on, I am literally the furthest point away from my apartment at this point - what could I do?  I've never been in this predicament before.  I'm no more than 35 minutes away from home, surely it'll work itself out. 

Mile 5: It didn't work itself out.  The feeling is getting stronger, and now my overflowing bladder has joined in on the party.  This is not fun at this point, so I pick up the pace a bit and hope to get home faster.  This had an unintended side effect, my bladder is now bouncing around and the prairie dog is trying to see the light.  Not only do I have to focus on keeping pace but also insuring all of my orifices remain tightly sealed.

Mile 6:  I am now praying to whatever deity in the sky will allow me to make it to a bathroom.  I had to shorten my stride, as things are now getting dangerously close to an even bigger problem.  This is increasing my time on the road and decreasing my ability to not turn my compression shorts into a diaper.  I may or may not have had a leaky faucet situation at this point.

Mile 7: THERE IS A GROCERY STORE in sight! My bladder, stomach and sphincter are now all actively working against me and attempting to stage an early exit.  Every step towards the entrance increases the necessity to go RIGHT NOW. I must have looked like a madman with the look of pain and determination on my face and at the speed I walked the aisles. I was soaked with sweat like I was recently in a wet t-shirt contest. But finally, there it was, the porcelain goddess. There was no time for a seat cover, barely enough time to close the stall and drop my shorts.  Unholy things happened in there, I exercised the demons out of me but it felt like I had won the lottery.  I left the store with my a bounce in my step, and a weight lifted.

I went on and finished my run because I might be a shitter, but I'm not a quitter.  

TL;DR: The moral of the story - don't be a FU like me and drink too much coffee before a long run or it might turn into the emergency runs.

t3_ksygpk,TIFU by insulting my coworker's face for an hour straight without knowing it,"Obligatory, this happened probably 15 years ago: I traveled to to Pocatello, ID to set up a new building with some co-workers. I caught the worst cold of my life, but we were all working late to get the systems up and running for the next day. At that age~19, I prided myself about my strong work ethic and never thought I should be a better co-worker to not get other people sick. I'm a really quiet, nice, would never swear, never touched drugs or alcohol on my life kind of guy at this age.

At any rate, my nose was like a faucet, so I took a break, went to a grocery store to get some medicine. I had never taken medicine in my life up to this point, let alone bought medicine due to dumb family beliefs. I understood the concept, but had no idea what to get for my cold. I asked a store worker what to get for a really bad cold. He told me, ""Get these ones. They're really good."" I thought to myself, okay, this cold is really bad, take triple whatever it says to take to really solve this cold. So I did.

I get back to the office and I keep looking at my coworkers laptop. He has this background picture of Andre Kirilinko, a basketball player on the Utah Jazz. Well, I did something rude about how I couldn't believe his agent would let them take such a terrible picture of him. All my coworkers laughed really hard. I thought, ""I'm so funny!"" So I made another joke that he looked like a manbearpig and he's coming right for us! Everyone laughed even more! So I just start railing on Andre Kirilinko's ugly face for like another 50 minutes with coworkers laughing like I'm hilarious (I'm sure I wasn't that funny, but I was drunk off the cold pills and thought I was Jerry Seinfeld with this primo material). 

Well, my jokes hit a lull and I decided to scoot over, closer to his laptop. My dumb F up was the entire night, but I looked at my friend's laptop and at the bottom, I read something. I said, ""What an idiot! They spelled his name wrong even! What MORONS!"" It was spelled ""Kirk-ilinko"" because my friend's name was Kirk. 

Then I looked at the face again and see that it was a crappy square Paintbrush Photoshop copy of Kirk's face on Kirilinko's body. I exclaimed, ""oh my gosh! That's your face!!! Ahhhagahaha! That's so funny! Oh my gosh!!! Ahahaha ! I'm so hahaha! Sorry! Hahahahaha!"" and all my coworkers were awkwardly laughing again and I couldn't stop laughing because they were laughing and vice versa. I was like an embarrassed hyena, red in the face, trying to apologize while laughing harder than I ever did in my life for some reason. I ran away to the bathroom cackling like a maniac, tears running down my face from it all. I'm sure the echoes of my laughter filling the empty floor sucked too. Another coworker, also laughing uncontrollably, said he'd drive me to the hotel, which he did. But I was still laughing the entire drive and all night until I feel asleep. The third friend that drove me home said it was funny because it wasn't anything like me, but didn't know why I kept going and going and going and that made it funnier because of how awkward it was.

The next morning, I apologized profusely to Kirk. He was so nice to forgive me, but I never have forgiven myself. I tried to buy him breakfast every morning for about two weeks, but he wouldn't have it. It's my most embarrassing moment of my life and I can't believe I was such an idiot and jerk. I still haven't touched alcohol to this day, partly because of this night.

TLDR: I got drunk on cold pills and made fun of my coworkers face for an hour straight because he photoshopped his face onto a basketball player and I didn't notice it was him, but made fun of the face relentlessly.

t3_ksxsnz,"TIFU by taking ""you"" referring to me in a business transaction.","Because of Covid and the new restrictions, the place I work has this drive-thru inspired ordering process. One door is where the orders are taken, the other serves as the pickup/outstation. 
Since it's cold, guests usually place an order and go elsewhere. So, a phone number is placed with an order, so the machine can text (that number connected to the order) once the kitchen checks it off as completed. Now, on to where I messed up.  

G is Guest
Me is My response  
[Paraphrasing will be used in the following sequence of events]. 

After placing the guest's order and number in, I went back to give his change &amp; receipt. He tipped me, I thanked him. While looking over his receipt, he goes:  

G: Are you going to text me? Or... 
Me: No, I can't! There is this thing about guests and workers, y'know... 
G: [something] my order?  
Me: Yes. For that. 

His head tilted once that was said, so I just nodded to avoid regretting more words. He didn't move or say anything after that, which caused me to take that as leave to go. 

I was walking pretty directly away from the door to let a manager know. I'm the type of worker that lets management be aware of stuff that has to do with me before someone or something else lets my actions be known, I hope that makes sense. 

The manager that was there found it more humorous than concerning thankfully! Then gave a couple of examples of how I could apologize if I was the one to give this guest their order.  
I ended up bagging his order, so I threw a couple of extra sauces in there for good measure. And when it came time to give it to him, it pretty much went with: 
 
Me: I'm sorry for what I said earlier, I didn't understand exactly what you meant.  
G: It's fine. Have a good night.
Me: Have a good night!  

Yep, that's the end of it. I told the manager that gave me advice on the matter, y'know. I didn't register what he meant partly because most guest uses the same phrase for that type of question. It's the first time, I've ever gotten a ""will you call"", it's usually"" when is the text"" or ""is it a text or call"" those type of things. I took him saying ""you"" as him addressing me instead of the business/company text he was expecting. 

TL:DR: Dude asks ""Are you going to text me?"", I said ""No..."" and started giving the rules of thumb. He was talking about his 'order ready' text. The manager gave advice, we said: ""...good night."".",16,2,tifu
t3_ksxqk6,TIFU by trusting an untrusty toot.,"There I(31F) was, sitting in the Arby's drive thru, when all of a sudden I felt like I had to toot. Nothing crazy, just a little tiny toot that would go completely unnoticed seeing how I was alone in a car. Also, it's not like I've been sick so what's the worst that could happen. Well, I found out real quick what the worst could be. I had just got done ordering so I go to roll up my window and as soon as it closes I let out my little toot. In a split second that tiny toot turned into liquid warmth and I'm just like, ""oh shit!"" I look around in the back seat for anything to help me out while also rolling my two front windows halfway down because holy god, that smell. I finally find an extra Aldi's bag to put under me so I don't end up getting poo on the heated leather seats, and I notice the people in the car in front of me looking back at me like, ""what the..."" Mind you, it's about 25 degrees Fahrenheit, so I look like a crazy woman rolling up to the window with my winter coat and hat on, and my windows half down. Then, when I get home I have to explain to my 11 year old how I need his help bringing food in because I've shit myself and have to clean up before handling food. He then tells my husband what's going on as I'm booking it up stairs to the bathroom. When I finally came back down, it was 100% the walk of shame. My husband, 11 year old, and 4 year old were waiting for me at the bottom and as soon as I make eye contact with them, my 4 year old just started busting up laughing and saying, ""Mommy pooped her pants!

Rewind to November 2019, I'm flying home from Mazatlan with my best friend. We were looking at a long flight home with a 2 hour layover at LAX before flying back to WA. I had been drinking before the taxi picked us up from the resort, at the Mazatlan Airport having 2 margaritas, as well as several drinks on the plane. 
Fast forward, we land in LAX and stop at the bar for some drinks while we wait for our plane. Had 2 mojitos, I think? Things are kind of blurry at this point. We board out last flight from LAX back to Washington and I order one final shot of crown. At this point I was wasted. And what happens when you are wasted? You have to pee. 
I wander into the bathroom at the front of the plane, just past 1st class, drop my sweats and start the empty the tank. 
Now here is where I fucked up. 
I vape, and I carry my vape with my in my pocket so it doesn't leak in my purse. 
Without even thinking, just being drunk on a plane, I take THE FATTEST rip off my mod and blow it straight up into the smoke detector. 
*fire alarm intensifies*
BEEP BEEP BEEP 
*BANGS ON DOOR, ""MA'AM??*

I realize what I have done, open the door with my pants around my ankles and a cloud of peachy blueberry shame comes out, and all I can say to the flight attendant staring at me is, ""it's perfume??""

This was the worst walk of shame back to my seat y'all. I thought the flight marshal was going to cuff me then and there. 
I get back to my seat and the flight attendant confiscated my mod which I handed over willingly as I was sobbing. I thought I was going to get arrested. 
I cry myself to sleep, and wake up once we land. I wake up in a blur hoping it was a bad dream, only to find that we had to exit on the tarmac. Surprisingly as I exited the same flight attendant that took my mod gave it back to me and I reluctantly took it back, saying I was going to get rid of it as soon as I got home. 
Exiting on the tarmac there were two cops waiting for me. They gave me two options, wait to see if the airline would fine me, or give them my information and they would detain me. 

I waited for a fine, and for whatever reason never got one. I got lucky, and to this day am not on any no fly list that I know of. 

Don't get drunk on a plane, and if you do, keep your vaping products away from your drunken self.

I took a shower, brushed my teeth due to stinch of rum, and then i was ready to go. She picked me up and her mom and sister were in the car, a crutial part of the story. 

Our first stop was at a strip mall down town. We stayed there for a few hours when it hit me. I hadnt taken a shit that day yet. We then left and went to the mall. My unborn chocolate child still brewing up in my butthole. We went to dinner and food only made it worse.

Then, we went to target. We walked around for 2 hours. My gf, her sister and i walked around while her mom did christmas shopping for them. My massive turd was now under imense preasure and was liquifying. After having walked around for a while still boiling my butt stew, i realised that i wasnt gonna hold it until i got home.

We got our Domino‚Äôs order. Ravenous with hunger, we prepared to eat the delicious feast of the domino gods. 
Right as we began I saw more headlights in our driveway... we live on the end a tiny road that no one else is on and has not outlet. So to find an unexpected car in our driveway at Midnight is odd.

t3_ksv073,TIFU by accidentally disclosing a coworkers person life situation to almost all of our other coworkers,"So, I have a coworker who's 2020 was above-average terrible. His family dealt with accidents, disease, death, divorce, etc one right after another. I think he was away from work more often than he was there this year.

I had started to learn some of the systems he worked on, and while I didn't get much more than an introduction, I knew more than anyone else so with him being gone so much, I was asked to take lead on some projects he was on. I got some test documents prepared and approved, then he came back and ran the tests. I didn't know what he was going through, and so went on working other projects and wasn't too involved in executing the test. But then, things really blew up in his life and he disappeared again. So, I only have the faintest idea of where things are and what needed to be done to wrap of the tests, but I plod ahead and occasionally can reach him to get a question answered. After a couple of months, we are just about ready to wrap things up.

Then comes today, the last day of the tests. I wake up with a headache and feeling dizzy. I get to work without much improvement, and grab the test procedure. I go in, chat with the equipment operators about how they feel concerning different steps in the test and what they remember doing, and going over what we'll need to do today to finish it. The entire operations staff is in the room for a morning meeting soon to start, and all their background chatter isn't helping me focus. One of the testers asks what's happened to the coworker. ""He was steamrolled by last year, with thing after thing going wrong, and he just needs some time to mend."" I say, trying to keep it basic and unpersonal, but make it clear generally that he's dealing with some things. We finishing planning, and I walk in a haze back to my office.

About an hour and a half later, my drugs and breakfast have kicked in and the haze has mostly cleared. An operations guy who was on the other side of the room comes in looking very serious, and asks if I have a minute. He informs me that what I said was absolutely not OK, and I have no business sharing things about this coworker. I am horrified to be informed that instead of a generic statement, I had listed several specific things he was dealing with that nobody in operations needed to hear, especially from me! I hadn't even realized that the general ""lots of stuff"" was translated into a specific list of stuff!

When the other guy realized that I hadn't been mentally all there, he said he'd handle damage control with the other operations staff, and the coworker going through the mire would be none the wiser. I wanted to apologize tk him, but the other Ops guy suggested I just drop it for. But now, I feel like I just destroyed my reputation at work and will have to spend months earning trust again.

Was is worth it? Yes. But next time I‚Äôll try satin instead of lace. 

TLDR: Shoved a lace thong up my cooter at the request of a kinky redditor. It was tough and caused internal rug burn. I enjoyed every minute of it but now I‚Äôm hurting.",17,18,tifu
t3_ksu3fa,TIFU by putting rosin in my backpack.,"This happened a year or two ago. In middle school, I was in orchestra (I played the violin) and so of course, along with sheet music and my instrument, rosin was pretty necessary in my weekly school life. (And for those who don't know, rosin is used on your bow to help it grip onto the strings and not slide around as much.) One day, someone forgot their rosin and so I lent it to them. They weren't able to return it until the end of class (due to the teacher, yaknow, teaching) and by time they gave it back, I have already put my violin back and up on the shelves we kept them on. Now this is where I screwed up. Thinking it would be fine, I chucked my rosin into the depths of my backpack. This led to it getting crushed up pretty good due to the god awful heavy textbooks we had to have. Now, as you can imagine, rosin duct is pretty sticky. It coated the *entire* bottom of one of my backpack pockets. I still haven't gotten a new backpack, and no matter how hard I try the bottom always remains *slightly* sticky. It also coated my lunch box with the fine white powder, making it look like im hiding a stack in my pack. Fun times.

t3_ksu1xu,TIFU by accidentally drinking my own body waste fluid,"Hello readers. As a setting to the story, I'm an over the road truck drivers, so most of my time I spent inside the truck, that sometimes, not all the time, include getting rid of bodily fluid inside a container, mostly empty bottles.

Today I was having mad sweet tooth, so I'm indulging my craving with the largest container of fountain soda Pepsi, think of it as 7-11 double gulp size. I finished that bad boy in less than 1 hour. Yes, I know, it's literally not good, but it's already in my system now &amp; I can't do anything about it.

As fast as it goes in, it's trying to come out as fast too, up to the point where I can't hold it anymore. As I'm in the middle of the highway &amp; not near rest area at all, I pulled over to the closest shoulder, stop my truck, put the hazard light on, and proceed to relieve myself. I wasn't thinking of using an empty water bottle where I can close with twist cap because I can't hold it anymore so I proceed to grab the closest container, which is the Pepsi cup container.

Here's where I set myself up for the screw up. Since it's a cup container, I don't dare to put it down on the floor, because it might tilt and spill, so I put it back on the only cup holder big enough to hold the cup, which is the one closest to me. It's only halfway full, so the lid on the cup will at least be able to prevent the content from spilling from the shake of the truck.

After a few hours of driving, a feeling of dehydration gets to me. Instead of grabbing a bottle of water, my idiotic brain thinks that since I bought the largest container earlier, there should be at least a little bit of Pepsi left in the container. I grabbed the upper part of the container, completely missed the feeling of the warmth of the content since it's only half full, also without looking at the color of the contents because I'm too busy focusing on the road, and proceed to take a sip.

In less than a second, I spat the content, getting my dashboard wet everywhere with an unimaginable smell, perform another emergency stop at the nearest highway shoulder, and proceed to gag on the nearby bushes. I grabbed my toothbrush and toothpaste and proceed to brush my teeth in the middle of the highway because this needs more treatment than just water gargle. On top of it, I also had to wipe my dashboard with lysol wipe. Luckily, the spat content doesn't damage any electrical parts of the truck, such as the radio and the ac/heater control. And I'm not proud of what I did, but I litter. Yes, I left that devil container on the side of the highway, and proceed to drive away, never looking back.

Please I beg of you to never ask me about the taste. Not only it's indescribably disgusting, but I can't even describe it, as nothing I've tasted so far in my entire life even come close to the taste of my own bodily fluid.

TL;DR: Relieving myself into the wrong container gave me the worst taste in my mouth, never again.

Edit: Many have asked, why didn't I just get out to do my business or dump the contents when I pulled over on the first shoulder? Because it was a very tight shoulder, as tight as a regular lane and on the other side is a guardrail that's literally inches away from my passenger door. I can't open that door &amp; I'll risk getting hit with incoming traffic on the driver side. As for rolling down the windows...foolishly I didn't think of that at all.",429,127,tifu
t3_kstc5y,TIFU by expressing my feelings for my friend to her in the wrong ways.,"So unlike most stories on the stop at this actually happened about 20 minutes ago. So for context, I‚Äôm 14 and I have ADHD and I‚Äôm somewhat mentally challenged when it comes to certain things. One of these things is expressing my feelings for somebody when I like them. Apparently my ways of doing this are quite creepy in stock rush which was unknown to me because most people just excepted it anyway. Well this particular girl that I caught feelings for didn‚Äôt exactly take my methods of expressing my feelings for her too well. Basically, she became really freaked out and uncomfortable and no longer wants to be my friend. We had just started to get close, which is ironic because she went to my school last year and moved upstate after we graduated. And now it just came to a sudden halt. I am absolutely shattered and I‚Äôm basically blubbering as I‚Äôm writing since I have attachment issues.

t3_kst9cx,TIFU my life by not knowing there was a difference between EMT and paramedic,"When I was younger, I wanted to do something impactful, something that would actually help people right there and now. I tried becoming a firefighter (lots of wild fires on the west coast) but it was almost impossible to get in.

I got a job as an analyst to pay the bills: spreadsheets, TPS reports, whatever. The entire time I still kept dreaming about doing something hands-on. I took a CPR class, volunteered with a local search&amp;rescue team, etc, but that just wasn't **enough**.

So here comes the fuckup part: this whole time, I thought EMT and paramedic was the same damn thing. (You always hear them in similar context, etc.) I remember decompressing at home after another ridiculously long pointless day at the office and doing some ""night-time revenge procrastination"" (that's a real thing, look it up) by reading up all about paramedic programs, admission requirements, etc. That was just pure fantasy because it takes 1,200-1,800 hours (basically 3 years) to become a paramedic, and I didn't have those kind of savings to take so much time off work.

So yeah... Just an hour ago, I was reading a book about basic survival skills - just your basic pop culture entertainment crap - and it mentioned that EMTs require about 80-120 hours of training. My surprised_pikachu.jpg face went on in a goddamn instant. Think ""I've made a huge mistake"" from Arrested Development.

All this time - all this fucking time - I could've gotten basic EMT certification in just a couple of months, and then joined the people who fight the good fight. At the most bottom level, sure, but it would've felt soooo rewarding. And even if that hadn't worked out, I would've known that at least I tried.

I fucked up so badly... Had I known about this year's ago, my whole life would've been different. Less soul-crushing office crap, more entry-level heroics.

When this whole plague business ends and I get my vaccine, I know what career course I'm signing up for. Until then, please touch base with your medicine-curious friends and make sure they know the difference and don't fuck up as badly as I did, eh.

TL;DR - I thought EMTs = paramedics = 3 years of study instead of 2 months. Stayed at a soul-crushing office job because of that.",29,17,tifu

She was bitchy (which is understandable) at first but, after a while, she understood why I kicked her out. 

That bring us to today. I texted her and asked her if 3 weeks after she starts her new job, could she give me a payment of $200 because i know it would be hard to pay everything at once. She texts back a while later, ‚Äú$200 for what‚Äù.

Finally we‚Äôre at event day. It‚Äôs a huge event with many presentation sessions and a few hundred people. It‚Äôs also the day I chose to have food court Mexican food.

I‚Äôll sit here quietly till she leaves and I‚Äôll make a break for it. 

Nope.....not that easy. It‚Äôs break time and all these ladies have been holding in the free coffee for hours. More women start walking in. At some point I feel like there must be ten of them.

I can hear the women getting impatient. I hear the whispers...‚Äùshe‚Äôs been in there a long time; you think she‚Äôs ok?; should we call someone?‚Äù

At this point I‚Äôm sweating bullets. Panic is really starting to set in, and my stomach starts turning. Also, my boss is texting me ‚Äúwhere the fuck are you? Get stuck in the toilet‚Äù. Buddy.. you have no idea

Just when I thought all was lost and I was gonna have to bite the bullet, the women start to leave. My heart rate starts to slow, and he adrenaline levels go down. I almost cry from the relief. As soon I think it‚Äôs clear I go straight to the door. As I‚Äôm walking out there‚Äôs a young woman about to walk in. She looks at me super confused.

t3_ksqyys,TIFU by deleting 11 years of weather data at work,"Obligatory happened a couple hours ago.

I work at a regional mesonet (weather station network) and today I was doing quality control by moving obviously bad data. These are mainly things like temperatures around -100¬∞C, daily rainfall values exceeding 2,000 mm, and other observations that definitely aren‚Äôt going to happen within our network.

For one station, I was trying to remove data for July 29, 2009 from 17:15 to 20:00, but accidentally put the end date/time as July 29, 2020 at 20:00 instead. This deleted eleven years worth of temperature and dew point data for that site.

I was very happy when our IT guy told me that not only was the data backed up (which I expected and was hoping to be the case), but it was actually a pretty straightforward process in the same page I used to remove it. 

Unfortunately, now I get to go through and do quality control on that eleven years of data because replacing it with the raw data also included data points that were previously removed when someone went there to do maintenance (including cleaning or replacing the thermometer). I‚Äôm hoping this doesn‚Äôt take too long, but it‚Äôs possible that it‚Äôll take a few days to go through.

i write a some new codes to give user some more option to say and have different path to move the conversion (like if she asked ""do you like ice cream?"" user could say No or Yes or ""it's depends on flavor""). when i was done with code, i started the project but program didn't open. code didn't gave me an error It should have been right. i was confused then my pc freezed for a second. then my pc gave me ""low disk space"" on my operating system drive. i checked my drive space and i went white as ghost . my operating system drive went from 5 GB to 800 MB in only 2 seconds and it was still going. only a virus can fill this amount of space in this speed. i closed my project but it didn't stop. my drive space was in 300 MB now. so i unplugged my pc. after turning it on i checked up drive space again. it was on 900 MB and was filling up again but not on that speed (like filling 100 MB in 2 minuets)

I‚Äôve always had a really skinny waist, and it‚Äôs impossible for me to find semi-comfortable pants that won‚Äôt just fall down, so I had the *genius* idea to wrap the waistband around my stomach. Twice. And then I tied it in the back. 

Note: it worked really great for most of the day. I went to work and didn‚Äôt have to worry about London britches falling down for the world to behold, and same went for school, all the way up until I got home.. then 6 o‚Äôclock rolled around and I thought ‚Äúhmm I‚Äôve gotta take a pŒπss‚Äù so I went upstairs and tried to untie the knot. No dice. I struggled for about 15 minutes until I realized it wasn‚Äôt gonna work.

This was a frightening dilemma for me for a multitude of reasons. I could either cut the knot with scissors and destroy my favorite pants, pŒπss myself and destroy my favorite pants, or ask my mom for help.

t3_kspqbd,TIFU by implying to my music teacher that I had emotional trauma related to the song ‚ÄúTake on Me‚Äù,"Okay, so the title pretty much says it all, but hopefully after reading it you‚Äôre left with... questions. Anyways, here‚Äôs my story.

I was in my sophomore year of high school when this happened. Luckily, the teacher this happened to was a substitute, so there wasn‚Äôt any lasting embarrassment. That doesn‚Äôt mean this won‚Äôt keep me up at night.

I‚Äôm neurodivergent (severe ADHD) and I tend to hyperfixate on my own music taste, going on and on about that one part in that one song that makes sad brain produce happy chemical. Unfortunately, the opposite is true for songs I don‚Äôt like, as I tend to complain about them to whoever‚Äôs unfortunate enough to listen.

I‚Äôve never liked the song Take on Me. It just kinda felt repetitive and annoying. Of course, this wouldn‚Äôt be as big of a problem if I didn‚Äôt have two younger siblings.

Now I love my siblings with all my heart, but they really do have a way of pissing me off. After hearing one of my tangents about how Take on Me was annoying and overplayed, they conveniently decided that was their new favorite song of all time.

And they would sing it over and over again. Before family dinners. During the chores we were forced to do together. All. The. Damn. Time.

Eventually I got tired of it and told them to stop.

Big mistake.

They would purposefully sing it loudly whenever I‚Äôd had a long day, was in a bad mood, or was annoyed about anything.

Over time, Take on Me devolved from ‚Äúkinda annoying‚Äù to ‚Äúif I have to hear this goddamn song one more time I‚Äôm gonna rip off my ears, boil them in holy water, and toss them off a cliff‚Äù

Fast forward to sophomore year. I‚Äôm in a school choir with about 45-50 other people. We had just gotten back from winter break, and if I wasn‚Äôt so filled with Teenage Angst I would probably be excited to see what new song we‚Äôd be learning and performing.

When my substitute teacher played the track for our new song, a chill tan down my spine.


It was fucking TAKE ON ME BY A-HA. Acapella edition.


I felt betrayed. I had finally managed to escape this song, that lived in the back of my brain like a storm cloud on the horizon of an otherwise mild sea. This song, with an unmistakable hook that had snared me like a clueless fish looking for a snack. THIS FUCKING SONG, which deceived me with the notion that it was going away for good, only to break into my home in the dead of night and slay me in my sleep.
 
Of course, I started looking for a way to get myself out of having to sing it.

I asked my choir substitute if I could get an exemption, ‚Äúfor personal reasons‚Äù. She offered to give me extra help on the parts I found hard, and I replied that I had an issue with the song itself and that ‚ÄúI have a bad memory attached to it‚Äù. She apologized profusely and allowed me a pass. I left the class feeling satisfied.

The next day, I was doing homework when my parents came into my room. ‚ÄúWe need to talk‚Äù

*Apparently, my music teacher thought I might have some kind of trauma related to Take on Me, and called my parents because she was worried about me.*

Mortified, I had to explain the whole scenario to my parents, who were trying hard to contain their laughter.

I ended up having to sing it like everyone else. I hated it, but at least it‚Äôs over. 

I‚Äôve had my fair share of embarrassing moments, but most of them, like the infamous Bus Incident, were funny in retrospect and I can still laugh about it with my friends. This one haunts me so much that it stays only between me, myself, and the 330 million strangers on Reddit.

ADHD is fun, y‚Äôall!

t3_kso08v,TIFU by falling asleep wearing earbuds,"So our story begins in March of 2020 (10 months ago). 
One fateful night, I was posted up in bed, listening to music with earbuds (the kind with the little rubber pieces that go in your ear (this is important)).  My usual plan when I do this is to, at some point before I fall asleep, remove the earbuds from my ears, and fall asleep, so as not to damage the earbuds. This was not a very realistic plan, and almost every night I did this, I would fall asleep with the earbuds in.
Usually this did not cause any problems, as the earbuds would gradually make their way out of my ears over the course of the night, and I would retrieve them from out of my blankets in the morning. 
This March morning was no exception, and I woke up without earbuds in my ears. While retrieving the ear buds from my blankets, I noticed that one of the little rubber bits was missing. I didn‚Äôt think much of it, as I lose them all the time and I had plenty of extras, so I replaced the rubber bit. However at that point I started to notice a shooting pain in my right ear. It felt like I had ruptured my ear drum again (I ruptured both ear drums on 2 separate occasions over the course of the previous year), so I went to my University‚Äôs Student Health Center. 
The NP there didn‚Äôt see anything wrong with my ear, but she gave me some ear drops which I used. 
A few weeks later it had not gotten any better, so I went to urgent care. Same result, doctor didn‚Äôt see anything, gave me ear drops. 
Repeat one more time after another couple of weeks. 

At this point I had really stopped caring about it. I had gotten used to the pain and the lack of hearing, and I didn‚Äôt think about it until maybe last month. 

Last month my hearing in my right ear got noticeably worse overnight. It didn‚Äôt even cross my mind to go see a doctor until yesterday, so I made an appointment with a real ENT doctor for this afternoon. 

Fast forward to the doctor sticking medical instruments in my ear. 

Dude asks, while looking inside my left ear (Not the one that hurts) if I wore earbuds often. I told him I had not worn earbuds since March, the day I noticed this pain.  He says ok, and moves to my other side. 

He starts removing some wax, then asks once more,

‚ÄúWhen was the last time you wore earbuds?‚Äù

‚ÄúMarch‚Äù, I said.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when the issue started?‚Äù, he asked.

‚ÄúYes‚Äù

‚ÄúWell I think I found the root of the problem‚Äù

Doctor shows me the rubber earbud bit he had just pulled out of my ear. I am now laughing hysterically.

The doctor was really nice, we were both joking about it, and now I can actually hear out of my right ear. I feel like a new man. 

I‚Äôll put a related picture in the comments.

t3_ksnzbf,TIFU by feeding coyotes that I thought were my neighbor‚Äôs dogs,"So, for context, I‚Äôm from Appalachia and coyotes are really common where I live, and they often come up to my neighborhood and just wander around. They‚Äôre not as common as they used to be since more people have moved up hear, but they‚Äôre still around a lot and you can often hear them howling and barking at night

So anyway, these two dogs behind our fence and our dogs were barking at them so I just kinda figured they belonged to one of the neighbors or something and I went outside and to the edge of our fence and I looked at them and I was like ‚Äúwow! Those are two really pretty dogs!‚Äù

One of them was various shades of grey like a wolf and the other was black. Anyway, they were absolutely gorgeous. So they were barking and I thought the barking was a bit strange but I figured they were hungry or something so I went back in the house and got some leftover meatballs and gave them to the dogs. I didn‚Äôt know if they would bite me or not though so I just set them down in front of them and they ate them right up so I went back in to get them some more but my actual neighbor‚Äôs dog, a large black lab named Coby, chased them off.

But I thought he was just being territorial and that the coyotes were just dogs so I continued my quest to get them some meatballs and left them on a rock near the tree line, since their barking was coming from the woods

And I had taken pictures of them so I could post them on my neighborhood Facebook group to ask whose they were and maybe tell them what lovely doggos they had when it dawned on me.

t3_ksnq8f,TIFU by losing Snowdrop.,"Typed this on a Phone, sorry for formatting 

My mom and dad have been separated since I was a toddler and they live three hours apart. My mom lives in upstate New York and my dad live in Long Island. I usually stay by my dad‚Äôs in the summer and I was excited because he said I can get a bird.

After a few weeks of bothering him we finally got a little parakeet with a huge cage lots of food and treats and toys. It was white and blue so we named it Snowdrop. I loved Snowdrop, usually in the summer I would stay up until dawn and sleep all day but when I got the bird I made sure I went to bet early to wake up at seven. Then I would spend the whole day together with it.

Soon though I had to go back upstate though for my half-sister‚Äôs birthday and because my cousins from Georgia were coming I had to go. And like the fool I was I decided to bring Snowdrop. I bought a little travel cage for the bird and I went upstate with it. There was food and water and toys in the cage but it was cramped so once I was upstate I made sure it got out as much as it could. 

Because my cousins were there my mom made plans for the whole week and was pissed I was spending a lot of time with the birdy so it got left in there for longer and longer and I felt bad. My dad came upstate to visit my grandma on his side so I wanted to go there and go straight home to his house but my mom said I had to go with them to Queens where my grandma on her side lived. 

There I tried to let the bird out as much as possible but for most of the day I was out hanging with my cousins. I showed them the bird but as I was but it back it freaked out and flew out the door my cousins were leaving in. I was sad all day and to make things worse it was the 4th of July so there were firework going off all night.

I posted Snowdrop onto every database I could find but I couldn‚Äôt go searching for him because the day after I was back at my dads. 

TLDR I lost my bird in the biggest city on the loudest night.

t3_ksnko3,TIFU by installing cheap aftermarket parts on my car.,"Back in November I bought my dream car: an Audi RS7 with low miles for a great price.  Since this is a German luxury performance car, everything for it is stupid expensive, but I knew that going in so I can't complain.  The car came with summer tires and I live in Minnesota, so winter tires are a must.  However, between COVID lockdowns and working from home, my original plan was to simply drive as little as possible this winter and get my winter wheels &amp; tires next year.  Unfortunately, the tires on my car are summer performance tires, and when it's cold out it's like rolling around on hockey pucks.  Also since I got the car I've acquired a girlfriend so I find myself driving a lot more than originally planned.  So I bite the bullet and got my winter wheels &amp; tires this week.      

So as I said before, everything on this car is stupid expensive, and that includes wheels and tires.  Combined they were $2,700, but that's not all!  See, because ""German luxury car"" each of my wheels has a tire pressure monitoring sensor installed on the inside of the wheel that tells the car what the tire pressure is.  So I needed to buy those too, but here's where I fucked up:  Instead of forking over the $680 for a set of 4 OEM sensors, I find a cheap aftermarket set of 4 on ebay for 50 bucks.  Normally I'm smart enough to know better than to cheap out *that* much, but since these sensors are pretty much standard across all Volkswagen Group cars (Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, Bentley, etc.) I thought I could get away with aftermarket.

Welp, after having the sensors installed in my wheels I discovered why they were so cheap:  The signal they send to the car is so weak the car doesn't pick it up and it screams at me that the tire pressure monitoring system is malfunctioning.  I could simply ignore it, since they aren't vital for the functioning of the car, but since this is my dream car and I want it to be perfect.  So I'll be bringing my car back to the dealership Monday to have OEM sensors installed and be spending extra money on the labor for this, which I could've avoided if I didn't cheap out in the first place.

TL;DR:  Bought aftermarket parts for my car which didn't work and now have to spend extra money buying OEM parts and having those installed.",1,10,tifu

After putting on my winter 15, I started my every year battle in January to try to lose that weight (don't worry this won't be about my weight).....being conscious of this I decided to leave about half the bag of reese's pieces on my night stand for the next day. About to go to bed last night, I remembered my night time snack delight, grabbed the bag and a handful of chocolate peanut buttery goodness, and poured them straight into my mouth and began to chew only to be met with what can only be described as pure acid fire. Of course I immediately spit out the duracell juice to see probably about 100 tiny ants running around on my bed (I forgot about the ants that had just started to show up in our room and they told their friends about my treat. Lesson learned don't leave food on the night stand, and don't consume food before looking at it.

t3_kslsvy,TIFU by cheating on an online exam,"So I had an online Statistics exam, and although, I studied a lot, still had a couple fields of theory that I wasn't really sure of. 

It was an oral exam scheduled to 8 am. 
After an hour of waiting I came finally. The teacher told me that I'm required to agree to being recorded, so if any questions occur in my exam, they can revise it, and they will hold the recording for 6 months. I agreed, I don't suppose I had another choice. The teacher then used R (a statistical programming language) to generate a random number to decide which topic I get questions from. It was the 2 out of the 10 topics about Maximum Likelihood estimation. And then I instantly realised that I miss a lot of the topic, and my inner self started panicking. I didn't even know how to start, I had no idea what the first theorem was, even though I knew it, it didn't pop into my mind. 

Then, my connection to the webinar got really weak, even lost connection, so I opened the e-book for the subject which I studied from, and quickly browsed through it to get a point of what to talk about. My connection then was dropping every 30 seconds for about 10 seconds. Then suddenly the teacher asks me to share my screen. I minimize the window of the book, then started sharing my screen. As soon as I hit the Share screen button, all applications pop up that were launched, including the PDF viewer, which was the first application that was shared. I was so surprised and shocked, I started minimizing all the applications. Then the teacher told me that he can see my screen. I'm not sure if he saw the book being open, or what was in the book. I passed the exam though with the second best grade. But I'm still anxious about being caught cheating, and having it recorded. I might even get fired from university if it gets out, lol.

Tl;dr: I tried cheating on an online exam with a PDF reader then had to share my screen. Then the PDF reader was the first thing shared. I might've got recorded cheating.",12,6,tifu

t3_kskdsg,TIFU by accidently almost poisoning my family and friends.,"So as some pretext I (16m) have just started making mead as a hobby. I have always wanted to brew and ferment so I took quarantine as the time to start. I would like to note that it is 100% legal and very safe (besides this one goof) and sanitized.

But to the story, for several weeks I have been preparing and gathering ingredients for a lovely pomegranate mead which has led me on a chase for finding dried rose petals, dried elder berries, fresh yarrow, fresh dandelion, and lastly fresh violet. It was a hassle to get all these ingredients since they are uncommon and I can't have a lot of fresh goods shipped since they would no longer be fresh but lucky for me I was able to find some violets at a gardening store and took them home and cared for them a few days before my brewing was to begin.

Now you may or may not know this, but I did not know that *most* violets are edible, but African violets, the ones I just happened to get, are actually toxic, my recipe failed to mention that I should avoid the most common violet which happens to be toxic so I just picked the only one they had. 

Now not knowing of the silent purple killer in house I began gearing up for my brewing, I went through, put all the ingredients processed and in, it came together perfectly and I even sampled a bit before putting my soon to be active yeast in. Now I was happy with my brew and put it in my room before going off to water polo practice. 

Now by the time I returned my yeast babies had started doing their job and fermenting and as I looked away from my beautiful soon to be mead, I saw my violet plant sitting there in the corner, and it hit me. I completely forgot to add the violet, I shrugged my shoulders as it wouldn't greatly alter the recipe and went to bed.

Many hours later my mind was still thinking about the violets when I got a weird feeling, so for some reason I googled if AFRICAN violets were edible, not just regular violets. And low and behold google told me that they are quite toxic and I don't even know what emotion I felt realizing I had FU by forgetting to add the violets, but that had actually been the FU that prevented my family and friends from getting some degree of poisoning. 

TL:DR I tried making a pommegranate mead and got poisonous violets instead of edible ones, but luckily forgot to add the ingredient as a whole.",64,21,tifu

They used to almost hate one another but now they‚Äôre okayish. A couple of months ago, I asked my dad If he still had photo albums and/or videos of me as a child. He took me to the attic and showed me a box with the name of my mother written on it. The box was filled with a couple of tapes and massive photo albums. I decided to look at the childhood pictures first and was too lazy to reinstall our old VHS recorder. I brought the box at my mom‚Äôs place and forgot about the tapes until yesterday. 

I wanted to have some alone time and decided to reminisce over my childhood. I attached the VHS recorder on my childhood tube tv, made some comfort food and watched some 360p resolution disney movies. As I became even more nostalgic, I decided to watch the tapes my dad gave me. I started getting a bit emotional yet happy to see me as a toddler, with almost no hair and my parents being happy together. I wanted to see more so I put on a new tape in the recorder. I waited for a few seconds before I could see my parents naked in bed, kissing each other and my dad proceeding to have sex with my mom (I barfed a bit while writing this). Never in my life have I jumped so fast and pulled the plug of the tv out. I felt like I‚Äôve just watched the videotape of the ring. After building up courage for minutes, I closed the box, put it in the basement and made sure nobody was ever going to find that cursed sex tape again.

TL;DR My dad accidentally gave me his and my mom‚Äôs sex tape and now I‚Äôm traumatized

Edit: I‚Äôll answer here the most common questions:

I didn‚Äôt destroy the tape since I have zero right to do so. It‚Äôs property of my parents so I have no business in destroying it even though I HATE it. 

The cursed tape didn‚Äôt go in the box with the non harmful tapes and has been hidden in a place where It wouldn‚Äôt harm others like it did harm me. 

I also have no idea how those tapes are still in pretty good condition. They have the same quality as they did back when I still had my innocence (the disney tapes)

For those with a similar story as mine, you‚Äôre not alone. Stay strong.

t3_ksizvj,TIFU by drinking $600 worth of booze.,"I lost my Uncle this past fall. He was the odd duck of the family and I loved him very much, we had lots in common. He introduced me to many of the things I love to do.

He was a high paid Lawyer and was terrible with money. The rest of my family is poor, so I grew up hearing tales of his monetary misdeeds. For example, he used his bonus one year to buy a condo in Key West only to lose it because he didn't pay his taxes. He was so bad at adulting he never had a phone line for long because he'd forget to pay the bill, so his company gave him a cell phone that they paid for (unheard of at that time) The company he worked for loved him for his work. There are many other stories, but on to the TIFU.

I asked by my Mother if I wanted any of his books from his summer bungalow (not as grand as it sounds, more of a higher-end trailer park. you own the house, but pay a lot fee and get to have a beach house with on Long Island but not pay 1m plus for it) I could not let books go to the dumps so I went with her with a ton of bags and filled my truck. She told me to take anything I wanted or else it will go in the dumpster so the place can be empty when they sell it. Most of the non-book related stuff was junk. I found some great pictures that I kept and a few other odds and ends.

One of those odds and ends is the heart of the TIFU. It was a smallish red box with a brass plaque. It has a small bottle of booze inside. I should have known it was not a normal bottle of booze because it was in a glass case with some other beach themed bricka brack. So fast forward last night, I pull out the box and after a hard day, I think I'd give it a try. I'm not much of a drinker, I'll have a glass of scotch every few months but that is about it. No beer or wine unless I use it for cooking. My lack of experience with alcohol comes in to play here.

I sit down get out two glasses (one for the wife, it's good to share) crack open the case, and pour us each a little taste. That first sip was when I knew I had fucked up. It was way too smooth, like zero burn at all. I finished my glass and but the supplies glass (spoiler, it's not glass) stopper in the top to save the rest for later.

As I'm sitting there letting the warmth radiate out from my belly, I grab my phone to see if I can find more of this excellent booze. I think I've just added one more thing that I can accredit my Uncle for turning me onto. I just drank a $600 dollar Louis XIII Cognac. I start freaking out. I frantically search hoping to find out that please god let this not be what came up on the search. Yeah nope. Even the empty crystal bottle and case sells for over $100 bux on ebay. There are so many things that I would rather spend $600 on than a drink. I even had a nightmare about it last night.

And that's how things went when you were my Uncle. A $600 bottle of booze hidden among the junk. Thanks for one last wild ride Uncle.

t3_ksiv31,TIFU by picking the movie to watch on Christmas,"Happened a few days ago. Be aware that there are spoilers for the movie ""Mandy"" ahead.

I was spending Christmas with my girlfriend's family, and after lunch we all sat on the living room to watch a movie. It was me, my girlfriend, my brother in law, my mother in law, and, most importantly, my father in law.

Now, my father in law is a very different person from me, a really ""rough around the edges"" kinda of guy, but I'm good at reading people and adapting so our relationship is great. For example, I know what kind of movies he likes. He likes those no-bullshit action films and I love them too, so I'm great at picking movies for us to watch. I introduced him to John Wick knowing that it would be perfect for his taste and he loved all three films. So I was pretty confident in picking the movie while we were browsing Netflix on the couch.

This brings us to Nick Cage. He is a very versatile actor and has been very memefied in the last decade, but he used to do these action and adventure films that were great for dads. I remember watching his films with my dad and having a great time. So when I saw that Netflix had this new movie with him called ""Mandy"", I suggested we watched it.

This movie is very popular in my internet bubble, I had seen a lot of people online praising it, but I knew nothing of the movie. All I knew about this movie is that it was a revenge flick and I had seen a screenshot of him covered in blood, so I thought it would be the action and murder filled movie that my father in law would love.

As soon as the opening credits started, I recognized a song from my all-time favorite band, King Crimson. This was when I knew I had fucked up.

Now, l really love this band to death, but it is a very weird and alternative prog rock band that I was sure my father in law would hate. He is a more straightforward rock kind of guy, Dire Straits style. So I knew that any movie playing King Crimson would not be of his liking.

First, the opening credits take like half an hour. My father in law complained about how long it was, went to feed the dog in the middle, and when he came back it was still going.

He starts guessing what is gonna happen. He says that Cage seems too happy, that someone is probably gonna murder his wife and he is gonna go on a killing spree for revenge.

He was right on the nose. However, it takes about two hours for this plot to kick in, which felt like two weeks. This is a very experimental movie and a slow burn. What took place next is one of the most embarrassing experiences I've ever endured.

My girlfriend falls asleep almost immediately. Then my mother in law falls asleep. My brother in law fucking gets up and goes to a room to take a nap. So it's just me and my father in law watching the movie. All I can do as the movie drags on is say, ""dude, I'm sorry, I thought the movie was gonna be different. Do you wanna stop watching it?""

""No, I wanna finish it"", is all he says, with a stern face.

At some point he just starts fast forwarding and skipping scenes. Every time he does this I ask if he wants to stop watching it. He just says, ""No, I wanna finish it"".

My mother in law wakes up in a psychedelic scene where a cult leader is giving a speech trying to fuck a girl and gets naked, and all she says is ""what the fuck is going on"".

She fell asleep again almost immediately.

At some point my sister in law, who lives righ next door, comes to check in on us. She sees that almost everyone is sleeping and asks, ""what are you guys up to?""

""I'm embarrassed because I chose a bad movie for us to watch"", I reply.

My father in law says, ""bad doesn't quite cut it"".

She leaves after watching a couple of minutes of this weird-ass movie. I'm just sitting there with my father in law feeling embarrassed all the time. At some point he starts talking to Nicolas Cage and asking ""why the fuck did you do this movie, man"". Eventually I ask if he wants to just skip to the end and we get to see some murdering. There's some chainsaw on chainsaw action that was pretty sweet.

My father in law was quite a good sport about my fuck up even tho he was clearly annoyed. He made some jokes and we had a good laugh. However, I'm not allowed to pick movies at his house anymore.

TL;DR: Choose a weird experimental movie to watch with my girlfriend's family and they did not like it.",10,4,tifu
t3_ksi13w,TIFU by forgetting how my couches were moved into my apartment.,"Yada yada happened a year ago yada yada. This didn‚Äôt happen today but I don‚Äôt think it matters because there is still a lesson of stupidity to be learned. 

Sooo. Back story. I had bought a new set of couches that were set to be delivered on a Monday, so I had planned to borrow my works truck and trailer to move my old couches out over the weekend. Problem was I had forgotten that when we moved in the movers couldn‚Äôt fit the couches around the bend at the front door, so they had to bring them in through the sliding doors on the back porch.

Here in lies the first of a series of problems.. At the time the back porch was open. I had forgotten about this minor detail when they enclosed our porch with screened windows about a year prior. I measured the screens and there was no way the couches would fit through the screen openings. 

These older couches were still pretty nice and a used furniture store down the street had offered to buy them for $230. So at this point I didn‚Äôt want to get an axe and go to town on them or anything. 

So I called the apartment office and informed the woman who answered of the problem. She was kinda pissed because apparently they had sent out emails about this that I did not read. My fault. I apologized which didn‚Äôt help. She said she would call me back and when she did, she told me that I would be charged $200 for contractors to come out and disassemble the screens to remove the couches. 

Unfortunately the contractors couldn‚Äôt come until the following Wednesday and the new set was still scheduled to be delivered on Monday. Here I found out that rescheduling delivery within one business day meant a charge of $30. So I had broken even on the cost of my fuck up. I ended up saying screw it, borrowed an axe and saw and had a someone fun time destroying the old couches and taking them to the dump piece by piece. Problem resolved.

In comes the last fuck up in the series. I had not considered how the delivery company was going to get the new couches into the house. As they would not fit through the screens, as well. 

And this is how I shot myself in the foot, or more aptly feet, and was out $460.


TLDR: I forgot my couches were moved into my apt via the porch and when the complex enclosed the porches with screens had no way to get the old couches out, or new couches in, resulting in a clusterfuck of stupid issues.",5,1,tifu
t3_ksgjai,TIFU By leaving my oven on,"So, this actually happened 2 nights ago, but here it is. 

Some background you should know is that I live in a pretty old house with really old appliances. That being said, My oven has no vent hood, and will warm the entire kitchen up when we use it. I even have to set the temperature to 50 degrees lower than whatever the instructions say because it isn't calibrated properly. Its a pain in the ass but we cant afford a new oven so we work around it. Above my oven sits some shelves that contain various cooking supplies. Oh, its also note worthy that it is a gas powered oven/stove.  


On with my fuck up; I decided to make some apple crisp for my husband, his brother and I, so I did. I guess I forgot to turn the oven off because at some point in the wee hours of the morning (somewhere around 2:30-3 am HOURS after I had made the crisp) my brother in law said he heard the loud sound of a glass bottle breaking.  He walked into the kitchen to inspect and saw that the heat from the oven rose into the cabinet above, where my husband had put a brand new bottle of olive oil. This oil heated up, expanded, and then made the bottle explode causing a MASSIVE mess of olive oil that was headed straight for down inside my stove and oven....where there were LIT pilot lights. If my brother in law hadn't been awake, I'm pretty sure my house would have burnt to the ground with us inside. He even said he tried to come wake us and we didn't hear a thing.

My family doesn't know anything about that and I didn't really plan to even tell them because my mother and my younger sister are deeply homophobic. i have some older siblings though, especially my older brother, we were very close since I moved out of my moms horror house at a young age. Let's call him John. So John and I have always been very close to each other and therefore discuss even a little...""weird"" topics. So like, this was about kissing and we were in a zoom call and he just started to talk about how he hasn't found a girlfriend yet and suddenly he drops ""but hey, I really like kissing girls"". And me, the stupid person I am, just answers ""yes, me too"". Obviously, my brother stops mid-sentence and stares at me who I am now sitting and seeing my life passing in front of my eyes. Because although John and I are close, John always was a ""snitch"" (yes, being 28 years old) and it's obvious he'd tell my mum. He quickly ended the call even though I was begging him not to tell mum and said he needs some time to think.
I'm scared to be honest, afraid my mother - even though I don't live at her home anymore - will do something horrible (yes she tried to attack or stalk me several times, police even got called and stuff) or my siblings, especially my younger sister (17) who is under the strong control of my homophobe mother. 

TL;DR: accidentally outed myself to my older brother as bisexual, he is a snitch and will probably tell my homophobic mother",157,53,tifu
t3_ksebpz,TIFU; noise canceling headphones worked TOO well.,"Now I have no wallet and *might* get fired.


Obligatory this happened yesterday as I've been running around trying to fix everything. 

New headphones for Christmas (thank you parents !!) They were kind and sent me a pair saying ""Merry Christmas NecroPastoral, hopefully these will help you relax"" lol. 

Never had real noise cancelation before. Just studio monitors earbuds, etc. 

Fell in love with my favorite music all over again and was addicted to the experience. Not realizing it's a bad idea, I went into town to get some errands done for work...without taking them off.

 Drove there, got out of the car went to home depot, did self check out went back to the car.

 Took out my keys, my *wallet falls out of my jacket*, I DONT HEAR IT OR FEEL IT FALL, STILL WEARING THE HEADPHONES (I had gloves on which didn't help) hop in the car, come back to work and..... Oops no wallet to swipe back into the parking lot. 

I should have just called my boss and fessed up, but I wanted to save face like an idiot, so I drove back. Found my spot. No wallet. Spent an hour trying to find it, went into the store to ask, nothing. If I had just accepted I was screwed I wouldn't have pissed my boss off so much by being an hour longer than I should have been. If I hadn't actually lost my wallet he would have fired me. So silver lining I guess. 

TL;DR - got headphones to help relax me, worked too well, lost my wallet and maybe my job.",659,160,tifu

About 10 mins ago my friend and I decided to go cycling, so while waiting for him to get ready i decided to get the bikes out of the shed and have a quick look at his chickens. He has 5 hens and a big rooster that usually sits there quietly looking out on his mini kingdom. I thought that it would be a fun idea to see what reaction the chickens would have to me playing some chicken noises from YT, and this is where the problem begins. I clicked the first video on the list which was a rooster crowing, the moment the rooster heard the video, he started crowing loudly and screaming like a 5 year old on Christmas morning. He wont stop and its loud enough to be heard from the next street over. I have googled how to get him to stop but short of wringing his neck and having him for dinner, there is no way to shut him up.

Literally right after I told her, I threw up, and no I did not make it to the restroom in time. It was literally so gross, I threw up into my mask and all over my shirt, like a child would do. 

Then, I had to rinse of my mask, (thank god it was still early and there were no customers to see) and switched out my shirt for the sweatshirt I brought. I then had to wait another 20 minutes before I could go home.

t3_ksdm8g,TIFU by almost poisoning myself.,"So my part in this happened Monday but my Mum added to this today.

Info: I am allergic to oranges (be it man made or natural) in which it messes my stomach up and since it was discovered I try to avoid at all costs as anyone would do with an allergy.

On Sunday whilst at aldi I was grabbing my usual bottles of smoothie when I noticed a new one in the mix and quickly scanned the label before purchasing. Monday was my first day back at work after Christmas holidays so decided I would try the new one and plonked it down on the table next to me whilst I got myself comfy and looked at my youtube subscriptions. As soon as I looked up to grab the bottom I noticed immediately the ingredient 'orange juice ' on the side of the bottle where it lists all the fruit. Had the bottle been facing a different direction things could of been a lot worse.

Now here is how my Mum FU as this morning she asked if there was anything I wanted from shopping and I replied another smoothie and she basically got full of herself saying how she checks the bottles before getting them but still got me one. During my lunch break (working from home) I noticed the bottle in the fridge and without even looking at the ingredient list I immediately recognised it as one I could not have. I then asked my Mum if she did check the label and she said yes and I replied with ""why did you get me one with orange in then?"".

So yeah not only did I nearly poison myself but my Mum did too.

TLDR: have allergy to orange and accidently bought a smoothie containing it and when asked Mum to buy me another one in weekly shop she accidently bought one with orange in as well.",58,13,tifu
t3_ksdhxm,TIFU by misjudging the display size of my camera during an MS Teams meeting (Semi-NSFW) .,"First a bit of context, I have an 18+ calendar (one of those you find in a car repair shop) hanging on my closet and since the lockdown started I have been sitting in my bedroom (where my closet is) doing my school work. Most of the time I have my camera on and that is where this fuckup starts.

I am fully aware that I have this calendar in my room, but before I joined any meeting I checked whether the calendar was visible. If it was visible I would turn my laptop so it would just be out of view.

So I was doing as I described for a couple of weeks until a friend from my class messaged me with a picture...

As you would expect I get a picture of my camera with the 18+ calendar 100% clear in view. I immediately turned my camera off and thought to myself how that was even possible. Well, apparently MS Teams preview doesn't show the whole camera which I thought it did. I also interacted/spoke up a decent amount so my bedroom was seen pretty often I imagine.

I guess you could say I found out about the camera backgrounds setting the hard way (pun intended).

t3_ksd070,"TIFU by trying LSD and loving it, but also running it for myself in the process.","So as a kid I had some seriously fucked up nightmares. My body would wake up but my brain thought it was asleep and would use wherever I was as a setting for a nightmare. Most of them I had no memory of. Sometimes I could only remember fragments just like an actual dream.



The full on night terrors that I remember were generally the same - I would be somewhere in the house and see spiders crawling in every corner of the ceiling. I also felt them crawling on my tongue and I'm scratching my tongue to get them off. I'm terrified so I'm calling for Mum and Dad but it's these two strangers telling me everything's alright but I don't know them, where are my Mum and Dad? They say they are my Mum and Dad but they aren't so I start screaming but the spiders are still on my tongue! Somehow I'm in the bathroom so I try washing my mouth to get rid of the spiders. My hands start feeling weird and I see my fingers swelling up to the size of sausages. Meanwhile the spiders on the ceiling are getting closer.


I've had a handful of times where it would happen in the middle of the day even when I hadn't been sleeping, something would trigger in my brain and I'd feel myself slipping then BAM sausage fingers. I grew out of it. My last one was when I was about 12.


20years down the track to last weekend I took LSD and mid-trip I get an old familiar feeling, that slipping feeling, and my hands felt funny...I looked down saw my good ol' sausage fingers again! No spiders though. Hoping it stays that way for future trips.


So turns out what I pay to experience now, my brain used to be able to do for free. With my old night terrors in the front of my mind I'm worried my next trip will be a bad one revisiting my old night terrors. Great.


TLDR: I only just discovered the wonderous world of psychedelics and learned the freaky shit I used to see as a kid were hallucinations so I'm reluctant to do it again in case I see some of my more terrifying childhood hallucinations (spiders on the ceiling and in my mouth).",16,8,tifu

I‚Äôm on the stage, the sponsors are paying me for 2 hours, which is a fucking drag of a show, if you don‚Äôt have anything to talk about, but this is 2021, six days in (at this point) and my first show in almost exactly a year.

(To preface this, I was visiting my hometown, with my lovely fianc√©e, and we were staying at my parents‚Äô.)

I look out amongst the smiles, and there he was, 6‚Äô2, 200 pounds, and pissed the fuck off. My dad has always hated potheads, and though I never have used pot on my own volition, I knew there were talks to be had. I knew that I was about to have the lecture of my life, I‚Äôm a grown ass man, about to have my soul crushed by parental disappointment. I had to really focus to get the story out of my lips, and as I finish, say my goodbyes, and start to walk off stage, I have the butterflies of a promposal-ing teen with his balls in a Vice.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve only ever been good to you son, and you never talk to me‚Äù

I know, I‚Äôm sorry dad

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm some Dick that hates you, I‚Äôm your father for fuck‚Äôs sake‚Äù

W-w-well sometimes you‚Äôre hard to talk to (I‚Äôm noticing that he‚Äôs not angry, he‚Äôs hurt)

I thought that I had life alllll figured out, I thought that I knew up from down, left from right, good from bad, but then you were born and everything changed. I couldn‚Äôt be the me I was when I was your age, care free, like three bills and a car I bought for nothin‚Äô.

Sometimes you‚Äôre hard to talk to dad

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard now because you keep secrets and then the truth comes out‚Äù

It‚Äôs not a secret, I just told a few dozen people and I plan on...

‚ÄúA few dozen strangers but not your own father!?‚Äù

Well, this is my dream, dad, it‚Äôs just a funny story

‚ÄúA story that makes me sound like a Dick‚Äù

Dad, you‚Äôre in it for a total of three sentences, maybe

‚ÄúStill, all of these people don‚Äôt know me from job, but they know I‚Äôm an asshole‚Äù

You‚Äôre not an asshole

‚ÄúWell I sound like one when you talk about me‚Äù

Well if you weren‚Äôt an asshole in the story, it wouldn‚Äôt be funny, I guess

‚ÄúIf I wasn‚Äôt even in it it would be funny, you just threw that part in to make me feel bad‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt even know you were coming

t3_ksbgzx,TIFU by running the dishwasher.,"The context; my partner and I are both currently working from home because, y'know. I'm a writer and so as long as I have my laptop, a mains socket, and WiFi I'm pretty much set. My partner, on the other hand, is a secondary school teacher who is currently teaching 20+ classes a week remotely. Naturally, much of her work is everyone's least favourite set of phrases right now; ""can you hear me?"" ""I can't hear you, turn yourself off mute"" ""can you see my screen?"" and so on. 

While I'm working in the 'study' (read: spare bedroom with a desk crammed in the corner) she's taken up residence on the kitchen/dining room table, the only other desk-like area in the house. She's fine with it, except when I'm half asleep in the morning and do dumb stuff. 

Came downstairs this morning to put a pot of coffee on, like normal. I notice that neither of us remembered to put the dishwasher on the night before, so went right ahead and set it off. Fast-forward to an hour later and I get a message from her saying that her students thought she was flushing the toilet because, while her camera was off, the microphone is naturally on and the cacophonous sloshing of the dishwasher is kinda hard to ignore.

Because my hair‚Äôs been bothering me, I was looking up ways to deep-cleanse it, and I found some articles that suggested baking soda, or apple cider vinegar, or both. 

Naturally, I dumped some baking soda into my hair, ruffled it around, it did a really good job of absorbing the grease and actually made me think about going platinum blonde/white at some point in the future. Then, I rinsed it out with apple cider vinegar - it sounds so cool to have all the fizzy directly on your scalp, but it also hurts (shocker).

My head‚Äôs white and powdery, and also dripping with vinegar, and that‚Äôs when I realized I‚Äôd definitely need to take a shower to wash away the sins of my experiment.

An earlier story reminded me of my New Year's. I decided to eat pot brownie, figured I was sleeping when I went into 2020 so being stoned for 2021 probably wouldn't make it worse. My roommate ate half of a brownie a few days earlier and felt nothing so I figure I can eat the other half. I should mention he smokes 3+ times a day and I don't know the last time I smoked weed. 


Twenty minutes later I know I'm in trouble. I thought these things took an hour to kick in and I'm already stoned. We're watching Grey's Anatomy, which was ""my show"", and all I can say is how awful that show is. I was on my third or fourth rewatch of that series but all I kept saying was how awful it was. Everything looked like it was shot in portrait mode and like just so cheesy. Roommate gets mad at me because somehow sober me is all about this show, he's gotten hooked but now I'm ruining it. Eventually he notices I'm high because I have the giggles and am just saying stupid shit just to entertain myself. After a bit I have to poop. I go upstairs and I'm sitting on the toilet when suddenly I forget how to poop. I don't know how to do it. I question if I am even pooping at that moment...what does it feels like? I don't fucking know. So I decide to just sit there until it feels 'right' to start wiping because obviously my body just knows how to poop. Poop finishes, standard amount of wipes, we good.


I don't know if any of you have experienced going to the bathroom and realising how messed up you are? I just experienced that, forgot how to poop, and now I have to navigate stairs. That just ain't happening. Lucky my bedroom is right next to the toilet so I'm going to sleep it off a bit. I lay there, convincing myself that no one has ever died from eating edibles, and just decide to enjoy the ride. I'm not sure if I feel asleep or the world just skipped a beat but then I realise I have to get downstairs because I am hungry but I still don't know how to do stairs. That being said somehow I make it downstairs without falling. I probably convinced myself that if I remember how to poop I should know how to do stairs but I don't know for sure. Get some munchies and start mowing down. 


While I'm eating the food I feel like I am just sinking into the couch, actually more like melting back into the couch. So I adjust myself forward but now I'm melting in that way so I lean back. This repeats over some period of time and then I'm done. Roommate tries to tell me what to do because I'm greening out but I don't care. I need to get back to bed. I make it back to my bed and I'm laying there hating how my weighed blanket feels but also needing to be under it because it helps anxiety just tripping balls. I don't remember how I know I was ""tripping balls"", but I just do. Next thing I know fireworks are waking me up at midnight.

So I've had this mouse for a couple years now, been good, over pretty good quality. However, I've always felt that it doesn't slide very well. Like whenever I would be playing an FPS like CS:GO or TF2, or even just trying to build quickly in Fortnite, it's always been difficult cuz the mouse wouldn't slide.

Welp today it was especially slow. Not both directions, just whenever I would try to move it to the right. I thought nothing of it and just tried to ignore it. I tried to ignore it until I rage quit TF2. I just couldn't slide properly for rocket launches. Welp, after rage quitting I looked over to my mouse and realized that it had a peice of plastic underneath it. Now personally, I like to keep my desk very clean, and I mean VERY clean. So this bothered me and I immediately tried to remove the peice of plastic, but when I tried to slide it out from under my mouse it wouldn't move. So, I then picked it up and realized it was a cover for the pads of the mouse( the part of the mouse the slides over the mouse pad). I immediately went to the other four pads, and sure enough they also still had their plastic covers. 

At least now my mouse it able to slide like ten times more easily.

My soon to be MIL basically commented that everyone should keep an open mind and that there's a lot of fake news being spewed by the media. She argues that Trump has done a lot of great things that the media doesn't acknowledge and that people shouldn't make rude comments about her president. My mom didn't realize who made this comment, and immediately replied that MIL is one of the idiots who blindly follows Trump and that if she agrees with him, then she's a traitor. She immediately apologized after realizing who it was and tried messaging her and texting her, but shes been unfriended, blocked, and now my fianc√®e is having a pretty heated political discussion with her mom.

I pull out and suddenly giant fireworks are exploding everywhere. Hoards of people on bikes with flashing lights appear out of thin air. They‚Äôre cheering and waving at me in my car. I am mortified.

Who were they? Crazy Trump supporters storming in the street? A hallucination? Whatever it was, big NOPE to driving home. I feel like a fell down the rabbit hole, was this real life???

So about a month ago, I went out for a long run with my 12 brother on his bike. I‚Äôm a decent runner, and I usually go for 8+ mile runs a couple times a week. I made sure to use the restroom before, drink water, and stretch before I started. I felt totally fine until around mile 4, when I started feeling a bit gassy. 

I didn‚Äôt think much of it until about the beginning of mile 6. By this point the gassy queasiness had evolved into something far worse; a volatile concoction eager to eject out of my sweaty ass. I began to pick up the pace, in a life or Shame race with my own body. 

I thought I was in the lead, until I reached mile 7 and I knew I was gonna have to make a choice between burning calories and burning a hole in my shorts. I walked another 3/4 of a mile, crossing my legs after each step in an ultimately pointless act of trying to postpone the inevitable. As I saw my apartment complex come into view, I felt a truly malicious urge move it‚Äôs way through my body.

I called out to my brother that I wasn‚Äôt gonna make it , and that he needed to go home and get my some wipes and toilet paper. He immediately understood, and peddled fast as he could home. Meanwhile, I found a bush on the side of the road, and searched for a nice secluded spot to perform my excrement exorcism.

I hid behind the bush, and luckily I was hidden from the outside world and immeasurable shame. It was dark by now, and the universe offered me some respite as it was almost impossible to see me. I then let loose the foulest, acidic, violent liquid erupt from my bowels. 

As I sat there squatting in shame with my shorts around my ankles, a toxic puddle of sadness below me, I saw my mother‚Äôs red 2004 Honda Odyssey pull over next to me. My mother got out of the car with a fresh pair of underwear and shorts, and a plastic bag, while my brother followed her out after. Silent as stomach after the ordeal, I slowly collected my dignity and Changed into the spar clothes and deposited my soiled and shamed undergarments into a bag. 

The car ride home was quiet, and I went home and took a shower and washed off the sweat and shit, but was unable to wash off the shame. We never talked about what happened ever again, and now I keep all my runs below 4 miles.

TLDR; I shat myself after running a quarter mile away from my house",20,4,tifu
t3_ks5kcx,TIFU by streaming my sex tapes at our family Christmas party,"Because of my Prime membership, I get unlimited cloud storage on Amazon Photos. So naturally, that‚Äôs where I store all the horrible filth I record in my spare time with random chicks I meet online.

I was at my parents house for Christmas, and they got me an Amazon Fire TV stick for streaming. I wanted to try it out, so I hooked it up to their giant 80‚Äù 4K TV in the living room which is right next to my dads desk. I logged into my account and it started downloading new firmware updates which took a while, so I let it run and decided to come back later.

I come back into the room 10 minutes later and my dad is sitting there at his desk, and directly behind him in all it‚Äôs 80‚Äù 4K glory is me and my ho ho ho.

What I didn‚Äôt know when setting it up, was the Fire TV uses photos and videos that are synced to your Amazon account to use them as a screensaver. So instead of a nice relaxing beach vista slowly pan and zooming on screen, was yours truly absolutely skull fucking some giant titted Latina wearing nipple clamps and handcuffs. Gluck glucking away at high volume like I was trying to ram a hole through the back of her head.

My dads hearing is terrible and rarely wears his hearing aids, so I have no idea if he saw it. But he‚Äôs the type of guy who even if he did see it, would never ever utter a word about it and pretend it never happened.

t3_ks5gr1,TIFU accidentally accused player of cheating,"I have a regular dungeons and dragons (dnd) campaign on Saturdays and we had an extra session today. All of us except one player and the dm use roll20 for speed and ease of rolling. That one player has massive luck and *very* rarely rolls below a 10 and almost never on important rolls. So it's a running joke that his dice are weighted. Therein lies an important difference in wording; just means that in manufacturing process there are defects that lead dice to roll certain numbers more often. Some are more imperfect than others, leading to permanent dice jails or favored dice sets.
That brings us to today when we had a high-stress mission to save the kidnapped queen. And he kept rolling extremely high (rolled below a 10 once or twice and those were for funzies). Another player, who dm's for him in another campaign, made the half-joking comment about *loaded* dice (intentionally either lying about the result or using other means to influence the roll). Lucky player immediately says well fuck you. Thinking it's the stress, I say well we have established one set is probably loaded (still missing the wording difference) - a while ago we figured out one set was a bit more weighted than normal but I don't think he uses that one anymore.
Aand that's when we realize we messed up. Player gets really pissed thinking we're accusing him of cheating and rolls on roll20 for a while before habit lead him to switching back. Felt bad the rest of the session but wasn't sure how to address it.

t3_ks5f1m,TIFU by not sleeping for 20+ hours before an assessment and possibly embarrassing another student,"TIFU: I'm doing my master's and yesterday we had to give presentations online. I've not really been able to sleep recently so when the assessment started I'd been up well over 20 hours.

I gave my presentation while trying to keep my eyes open and then proceeded to drift in and out of consciousness while others have there's. The lecturer was being fairly passive aggressive and rude throughout and it was kind of pissing me off as been as I know how hard people have worked on these presentations.

I wake up again just as the last presentation comes round and they picked the same paper as me. She proceeds to give an excellent presentation and the lecturer starts asking questions about it. He asks the class for their opinion on something he says and I chime in and sort of shoot him down a bit. I then realised maybe I should have let her answer first but I was literally running on fumes and he *did* open it up to the class... She says that she'd heard me say that earlier but didn't want to see like she was copying to which I said I didn't mind.

The session comes to a close and another class member sends a message in the group chat saying we all did well to which the last presenter replied not to congratulate her because she's ""dying of embarrassment"".

I can't help but feel this is due to me and I feel like a real arsehole...

TL;DR - Sort of answered someone else's assessment question and may have embarassed them in front of an entire class",8,4,tifu
t3_ks592x,TIFU By spraying a toilet in Europe in my shit.,"I noticed an uptick in shitting themselves stories, so I figured I'd jump in and share mine.    


This fuck up happened a little over a year ago. (Obvious TMI warning).

&amp;#x200B;

Before I go into it, I have to give a bit of backstory.  About 8 years ago I had my gallbladder removed.  I had major gallstone issues and it was that or face a medical emergency (ruptured gallbladders are no joke).  Luckily, the gallbladder isn't a required organ.  A lot of people think you have to change your diet permanently, but both my surgeon and two specialists I spoke to said it was false and nothing really changes.  For those unaware, your liver constantly produces bile which is used to break down matter in your intestines and turn it into poo.  The gallbladder collects this bile and then releases it when needed (usually after you've eaten).  Without a gallbladder, it constantly drip-feeds into your intestines.  


For the first two years, I was fine but then I started to discover a side-effect; if I fasted for too long, after eating I would IMMEDIATELY need to shit.  Like, no discussion, it's coming now.  Furthermore, it's very violent, generally wet - effectively a slightly more solid form of diarrhea; imagine mud.  I generally counter-act this getting up in the morning and eating breakfast (as you should) because if I skip it, and eat lunch, I'm running for a toilet within an hour.

So with that, onto the FU.

My partner and I took our first trip together last year to Europe.  For those unaware, a lot of toilets in Europe don't have seats.  As a North American'er, this is usual to me, but I decided my squat game was up to par, so I wasn't too worried.  We were enjoying our time in a small village when - for some reason, my intestines were like ""Hey, Toss - we're going right NOW"", regardless of the fact I had nothing to eat.  I ran for the nearest restroom, dropped pants and squatted over the toilet - or at least I thought I was.  After I finished, I stood up and turned around and saw, to my horror, that I had been bent over a little too much and rather than depositing in the bowl, I had sprayed all over the back of the toilet.  


Cue 5 minutes of me frantically wiping down the toilet (Hey, it was my mess, I wasn't just going to leave it - even used a bit of water and hand soap); my partner thought I had fallen asleep in there.  


To leave this on a positive note, I've since discovered probiotics and after a few months, while I still have the urge, I find it's more of a ""Hey, no rush but we should take a shit"" - also, things are far more... solid.  


TLDR: Went to squat over a seatless toilet to take a shit, didn't squat far enough and sprayed the toilet in feces.  Then cleaned it up.",19,3,tifu

At home, I've always had an ink printer, so it never occurred to me that laser printer toners are not infact, ink. I just assumed toner was just some fancy work for laser printer ink (its not something that would constitute as something id want to google, right? 

So this morning, my work printer gave the big no no with the red flashing light saying I cant print anything and the error said I had to change the toner waste cartridge or whatever it's called.

t3_ks49dm,TIFU by having spicy cravings.,"So this happened yesterday, but I'm still hearing about it. After work I stopped at the drug store to pick up a few necessities and was going for a Dr Pepper when something caught my eye. It was a bag of Lays Jalapeno Kettle Chips. I started craving it immediately but there was a two for sale and it was the last bag, so I grabbed that and a bag of mesquite kettle chips, my Cream Soda Dr Pepper and checked out. Having a long drive I opened the bag and  occasionally ate them as I drove home. 


When I got home I set the bag with the two bags of chips on the kitchen counter and opened the bag of Jalapeno chips and started eating them right there. If you know anything about kettle chips you know they are crunchy and loud. My wife and daughter who were on the couch at the time watching tv heard the crunch and both sprang up to get some as well. Here's the fuck up. The open bag of chips was still in the Walgreens bag so neither could see what flavor it actually was.

 My 14yo daughter took a big handful and started a chowing down. Crunch crunch crunch! But she's like me. She has a tolerance for hot spicy foods and enjoys them, so of course she had no reaction. 

My wife on the other hand... She doesn't tolerate spicy food. She sees me and our daughter eating chips though, grabs a handful for herself and pops a whole one into her mouth and crunch!  ""Dear God!"" She started hyperventilating, ""Why didn't you tell me these were Jalapeno?"" She was mad, like our daughter and I had betrayed her. My daughter and I unfortunately laughed. She did not find it funny.

TLDR: Craved spicy Jalapeno Kettle Chips and accidentally shared them with my wife who doesn't have the same tolerance for spice as myself and our daughter.",2,3,tifu
t3_ks3ek5,TIFU by not referring to a child as a king.,"Obligatory note that this actually happened a while ago, and I'm just posting it today.

I work at a print shop.  I sit at the front desk and do graphic design by appointment, or take walk-ins if I'm not busy.   On that day a large woman came in towing three young kids, no appointment, and (with no warning) started to dictate to me what she wanted on her son's birthday invites.  While this is rude, it's not uncommon, so I let her talk, started taking notes, and we got to talking about her son's likes and interests.  He's turning 5, and the whole time, talking about his favorite Power Rangers, but his Mom was having none of that and kept asking me to use Paw Patrol.  This is fine.  I have a rather limited selection of licensed and branded artwork, but if she can't just settle for generic graphics or pay for me to make something special for her son, so be it.  We finally got art style settled, and then she starts writing down the text.  The writes the kid's name as ""Miking.""  This is where TFU happened.

Now... how would you pronounce that name?  I didn't think twice about it.  I'm pasty-white with some Nordic ancestry, so I just started talking, pronouncing it like ""viking"" but with an M.  The woman interrupts me mid-sentence, and is apparently shocked. **SHOCKED** that I would so *boldly* mispronounce her kid's name.  She then spent about 20 minutes trying (and failing) to get me to refer to her toddler as ""My King"" before giving up and leaving without purchasing the invites, leaving me to explain to the boss why she sat for 20 minutes and ended up not buying anything.  


TL;DR woman gave her child a ridiculous name essentially declaring him a King and wasted my time unable to accept or understand why I wouldn't refer to him that way.  Poor kid is probably going to have a rough go of it in school with a name like that.",63,47,tifu

I had a dentist appointment and wasn't sure if I was going to be hurting or not afterwards so decided to catch a Lyft rather than drive myself.

I scheduled the pickup, got ready  and went outside to wait. I was expecting a black Kia.

After a few minutes, a black Kia pulls up, literally stops 2 feet in front of me. I wave to the driver, walk around to the passenger side, and pull on the door handle.

It's locked.

I look up and the driver (a lady) is *absolutely astonished* and staring at me.

Keep in mind, I'm 6'3"" and wearing a mask.

She steps out of the car and from the other side just exclaims ""can I help you???""

I ask if her name is (whatever the drivers name was) and if she's my uber driver. She says no and my heart just sinks.

I start hurriedly trying to explain, apologizing profusely - ""oh my god I'm so sorry!"", ""I was expecting an Uber in a Kia!"", etc.

I show her my phone and she points out her car looks *nothing* like the picture of the car. I just looked at the nameplate on the grill and didn't really pay attention to the model.

We both start laughing and, 30 seconds later my actual ride pulls up, so at least I got a little bit of vindication.

I got them out of the oven, got my spatula at the ready to serve. The tortilla had stuck a bit to the bottom of the dish, so I had to hack at it a bit while tightly holding the dish with an oven glove on my other hand. I finally get an enchilada free, and need to grab my plate. Since enchiladas are floppy beings, I needed to move quickly, but I don‚Äôt have the dexterity to grab the plate with the oven glove on. Thinking quickly, I stick the glove between my legs, remove my hand, and held the glove between my thighs while I grab the waiting plate and plop the enchilada onto it.

This was my fuck up. During the desperate hacking for a gloriously cheesy enchilada, the glove had made contact with some molten deliciousness. And I had just put it in between my thighs. The dish is still bubbling away guys - I was not patient. This is still oven-hot melted cheese. In a very sensitive area while I am wearing the cheapest leggings money can buy. 

It burned. Excitement for enchiladas is replaced by the shock of scalded sensitive skin. I quickly take a wide stance to drop the glove, and set the plate down. Melted cheese hangs between my thighs. 

Then my roommate walks into the kitchen. They see me. They see my weird stance. They see the splodge in my crotch area. I stare at them with panic in my eyes, while I‚Äôm pretty sure my body was in the pose one would make to impersonate a crab. They leave the kitchen again. Quickly.

I take my leggings off and soak a towel in some cool water and clench that between my thighs. I waddle upstairs like a shamed penguin. I‚Äôm now in my room scraping congealed cheese from my leggings. I‚Äôm not really hungry anymore.

I sat in my truck in agony for a few minutes before deciding to look up what might help. As I was desperate for some relief I quickly skimmed through many articles on the wonderful search engine that is Google and a couple mentioned peppermint oil can be used to sooth stomach aches. What I failed to realize is that it meant peppermint oil capsules, that dissolved in your stomach. Super proud of myself for my discovery, I reached in the glove box for the peppermint oil I used to sooth some sunburn over the summer that I just never took out.

 Down the hatch.

It only took a few moments to realize I may have just accidentally killed myself and my entire mouth and throat went numb and I stopped breathing. Every time I sucked in air i felt like a menthol cigarette ready to burn out.

(Don‚Äôt want to dive into the details.) Since 2020 was coming to an end I wanted to dye my hair a pastel pink because it looked very pretty on Pinterest. The day comes where I go to Walmart and my mom suggests the brown hair dye she used previously. Having only 20 minutes to decide I said yes, and my mom goes to look for her stuff. I go to the pink hair dye section and just look at it with despair. My mom comes back and asks my what I‚Äôm looking at. I quickly shove the pink dye back on the shelf and my mom looks at me with disdain, repeating ‚Äúwhat colour do you want to dye your hair?‚Äù I say brown and as we head to the cashier registers I naively feel hopeful that things will turn out well. 

My mom dyed my hair today a purplish brown but since I have dark hair it turned out to be a light brown. My friends and family say that it suits me and I feel guilty and terrible for thinking this but this isn‚Äôt what I wanted. My mom spent a good hour doing my hair and I just feel horrible for not being happy. (Luv u mum) Not because of the colour, but because I feel as if I didn‚Äôt dye my hair for myself. You see, a few months in advance, (before quarantine) I asked my friends what colour they would recommend. My friends said purple would suit me because my skin tone is pale, but my mom said brown hair typicslly suits asians. I‚Äôm not a people pleaser, at least I was in the past, but I really feel sad because I didn‚Äôt do this for myself. I know it suits me and it compliments my eyes, but maybe this fuck up wasn‚Äôt so bad because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm prepared for a drastic change to my appearance at the moment. At least now I‚Äôll dye my hair blonde in a few months and later incorporate the pink in :3. I think the hair colour is cute but I definitely am having second thoughts about this, because what if people find me more attractive with darker hair?  (Aka me lol, since I‚Äôm gonna wake up, look in the mirror and go, ‚Äúhuh, oh yeah I have brown hair now.‚Äù) Eventually it will wash out though, and I‚Äôm in online school this month due to lockdown procedures so I‚Äôm going to use this time to become more confident in myself as a person.

Ash and him really got along well they talked daily and personally really enjoyed eachother until back in 2019 near his birthday he learned that she committed suicide. 

R was devastated and fell into a depressive state because he didn't know how to cope but eventually he started getting a little better.

I wish i knew what to do but i just didn't know how to help him so instead of talking to him i would usually bail Saying i had plans with K he always understood which was alright i guess. 

However he texted me saying he was having a mental breakdown and crying because somebody in a server he's in joined and he showed me a screenshot and low and behold that person had the same name as Ash.

He said ""please call me OP i really need you.""  

I said ""Oof well i have plans with K so I'll cya later"" this time i actually did have plans but that's besides the point. 

He says ""please i really need you M is busy (his girlfriend) so your the last person i have left who knows how to help. 

At the time i have talked to him before and i did know how to calm him down but i snapped at him saying ""Look i get your upset but i have my own life i have K to take care of i wanna spend time with her instead of being your therapist"" and put him on mute.

Even more unfortunate than getting a huge black eye was the timing which happened to be the night before the most important presentation of my young career. 

Our story begins this morning when I woke up to find that only one of my eyes opened. A quick trip to the bathroom mirror found [this monstrosity](https://imgur.com/gallery/56mk3y1) looking back at me. After going back and forth and even asking on Reddit how I should approach the presentation given my stunning resemblance to Quasimodo, I decided that I should just own it and do my presentation without doing anything to cover my eye. So I finish getting ready for the big day and presentation then leave for work. 

The journey to work was interesting enough by itself as driving with one eye takes quite a bit of getting used to, but I manage to arrive in one piece. As I walk into the office, I‚Äôm immediately met with stares and could hear some hushed whispers among coworkers behind me as I walked by. I wasn‚Äôt long before word got passed to my boss who came to take a look at [the damage. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/fgzkad6) .  After the initial shock, he just kinda sighed and said the the CEO was ‚Äúgoing to love looking at that for the next hour.‚Äù  So, that wasn‚Äôt a great start.

I gather my notes and computer and go to the conference room to prep for my presentation. As I‚Äôm getting the PowerPoint set up, in walks the CEO whom I‚Äôve only ever seen in passing. There was an audible gasp when he saw my face, followed immediately by a ‚Äúwhat the hell happened to you?‚Äù  I had decided earlier that I was just going to try to make jokes about my eye so I didn‚Äôt have to be so self conscious about it and responded that I was in a club, but I‚Äôm not supposed to talk about it, followed by a laugh. He didn‚Äôt laugh. 

I try to finish the conversation quickly as other people had started to file into the conference room and I began my presentation. Even though the first joke didn‚Äôt go well, I still tried to throw in a few jokes like ‚ÄúIn this next slide, unlike me, you can see...‚Äù to a few polite chuckles from sympathetic coworkers. I finish the presentation and am thanked by my boss and the meeting was finished immediately after. 

A few minutes after I leave the conference room, my boss calls me into his office and tells me to shut the door. Uh oh. He begins by saying that he could see that I put a lot of work into my presentation, but he was very unimpressed with my ‚Äúunprofessionalism‚Äù.  He said that he had had a conversation with the CEO who had serious concerns about me, apparently worried about a potential unsavory life outside of work and inability to be serious in a professional setting. I try to explain that I was only making jokes because I‚Äôm self conscious about my eye, but my boss refused to hear it. He told me I am getting a formal warning and that I am one more fuck up away from getting fired, before telling me to leave and go to a doctor to get my eye checked. To top off this wonderful day, the doctor told me it‚Äôll be about a week to open my eye and about 4-6 weeks before I look normal again. Should be an interesting month.

I have bubbles coming out of my mouth, foam coming out of my nose. I can even feel it expanding and trying to go down my throat and up into my sinuses. I run upstairs to the bathroom and start dry heaving into the toilet. Nothing comes out, just bubbles as if I‚Äôm one of those bubble blower toys kids have at birthday parties. I sit by the toilet crying and trying not to swallow more soap and bubbles than I already have. My throat sings. My nose stings. I feel sick. Meanwhile I hear my dad downstairs, completely oblivious to my misery ask my mom, ‚ÄúSo, does this mean she‚Äôs not eating with us?‚Äù

t3_ks0tc6,TIFU by ignoring a debt collector.,"This didn't actually happen today, but was over a long period of time. However, the consequences caught up to me today.  About a year and a half ago I had a some financial difficulties, ran up a lot of debt, and was unable to even make minimum payments.  After several failed attempts to reach an agreement a credit card company I stopped taking their calls and it eventually went to a collection agency. Since I couldn't afford any payments I ignored their calls as well.  

Fast forward to today when a member of the Sheriffs department comes to my place with a civil summons from the aforementioned collection agency.  So now I have 30 days to come up with a stupid amount of money in order to settle out of court or take my chances and try to defend myself in court.  Moral of the story: do not ignore collection agencies!

TL;DR I ignored a collection agency for a long time and now they're suing me.",108,35,tifu
t3_ks0qma,TIFU by answering an online job ad and losing $1600,"This issue has occurred over the last two weeks and started around Dec 24th, really putting a damper on the holiday. I (25F) don't know if I'm more embarrassed or angry. 

I'm in debt now, and I just don't know what to do. All of the warning signs were there and I just didn't listen to my gut. 

I've been looking for a part-time position in something relatively low-stakes that I can do remotely and pay the bills, and I thought to myself that proofreading is the way for me. It's something I'm good at, something I enjoy, and it would give me something to do while I'm looking for jobs. I noticed this guy's ad on the website Upwork, a website for freelancers I'm a member of, claiming he was an HR manager from a reputable publishing company and required a proofreader for 3 months. I only asked for $20 an hour as that was my Upwork rate, and he agreed. He said the position was 30 hours a week. 

The ""HR representative"" only wanted to talk via Skype chat and every time I tried calling on Skype instead, it wouldn't go through. (I later found out that this man does exist, so I sent him a message on LinkedIn saying that if he doesn't recognize me, someone's tarnishing his name.)

I believed it when he said I should answer an online questionnaire (typing answers into text boxes) as my interview process. I believed it when he said I got the position the very next day. I believed it when he wanted to go on with onboarding and sent me a contract that looked legit. I didn't even ask when the original job posting was removed from Upwork for violating their Terms of Service. 

I didn't even get to start ""training"" when he said that he needs to send me a cashier's check as an ""e-check"". I was thinking to myself, what the fuck does that mean? But he told me to follow the directions from the HR department email I received shortly after. I got an attachment of a picture of a check for $1700 with my name on it from some other person (another red flag I didn't question), and they told me just print it out, deposit it with mobile banking (taking a picture of the front and back of the check with my banking app) and Zelle transfer $1600 to yet another person, allegedly the ""vendor"" for my equipment I was due to receive to set up a home office. I was wondering the whole time I was doing it if this was a process I could actually do. 

Narrator: ""It wasn't.""

I am an idiot. The bank obviously didn't recognize the check as valid, debited me instead and said that because the Zelle transfer ""already went through"", there's nothing they could do. Can't cancel it and refund me. 

As an added bonus, the guy I've been talking to has now stopped responding to my messages, with me originally asking for a refund before any ""training"" could commence and him continuously telling me that he would issue a refund but doing nothing. The vendor guy who called me once now has a disconnected number. (Reverse looked up the number and it's listed to an old lady in Georgia with a different name than the first three people I've mentioned.) 

So, I was up at 2 am with -$1600 in my account, on the precipice of tears, and I posted this on a kind subreddit that sympathized with me. Only got the idea to repost here a few hours later. Throwing this out as a warning to fellow job searchers: if it's an opportunity that seems too good to be true, it is. Fuck everything. 

**TLDR**: I responded to a proofreader position that I thought would be easy, only for the sketchy representative to hire me within a day, only communicate through text on Skype, have the original position deleted online, send me a picture of the $1700 check I was supposed to deposit instead of the actual check, and convince me that I could just submit a picture of a check for mobile deposit. I was then instructed to wire transfer $1600 of the payment to another person who would allegedly send me a work laptop and printer in exchange. Obviously my bank did not recognize the pictures as legal tender and debited me for $1600 instead. Being poor, I now have nothing and feel too embarrassed by my cluelessness to call the police. 

**EDIT**: I filed an original Zelle claim through my bank shortly after I was over-drafted, and I called the bank back today to check on the claim. I told the rep everything I said here, and she added it to my claim. I guess the only thing I can do is wait, hope that overdraft fees don't tank me and eat what I have at home. The rep said the claims department would be making a decision on whether to award me my funds back within a week, so time will tell. 

**EDIT 2**: Zelle requires a name and a phone number to transfer anything. I just used the number for info. The guy who I Zelled the money to actually picked up and I told him I'd filed a bank claim and a police report to scare him. I asked him for more information about who he sends his money to, and he said he would call me back.  He hasn't. (I wish I hadn't told him about the police thing because now I lose the element of surprise.) But the ""HR rep"" on Skype messaged me shortly after. I told him not to contact me unless he can do so on video. He read my messages but didn't reply. As I mentioned, I also emailed the real HR guy for this company and said that if he doesn't recognize me, someone is using his name for fraud. 

Talked it over with my mom, she's going to help me file a police report. She also reverse looked up the Zelle guy's info using his name and number, and he has multiple criminal charges under his belt. I still feel like an idiot (when I brought out the ""check"" I tried to cash, she just said to me ""you know this is fraud, right? Why didn't you call the police?""), but I'm an idiot with a great support system.",6,26,tifu
t3_ks0oua,TIFU open relationship trouble,"TIFU Open relationship having some troubles

Me and my boyfriend have been together for a year now and we love each other, but recently there has been a lot of tension and we have started to fight a lot. It all started when we had a fight about me texting one of my exes (who is one of my good friends that he knows about) happy birthday. He kept saying that I shouldn't be in contact with any of my exes and that he felt betrayed. This was very weird because he knew about my ex and knew that we were still pretty close. During that time there was a lot of tension but he ended up just hate fucking me and forgetting about it. We also had a fight about me going to a work event and talking to other guys, even though they were my co workers and it was a work conference. He claimed that I was being flirty and trying to fuck other guys. This was completely untrue and I have done nothing to lead him to think that I would ever do something like that. We talked and he said that he was overreacting, which I agreed with. 

After that the tension still wasn't resolved and we had many other fights. We both noticed that and took some time to talk with each other, and are relationship and sex life improved greatly. We also opened up about our fantasies and he said he wanted to have a threesome. At first I was hesitant, but later agreed to it. We found this guy who was 6'4, muscular, and just overall very handsome. The original plan was to have a threesome with him but then my boyfriend said that he wanted us to mess around first so we could get to know each other. We both discussed some rules and then he let me go with the other guy. The other guy was so much different than my boyfriend. He was dominant and put me in my place (I liked this a lot). Me and the other guy had so much fun, and we tried lots of different stuff (Like bondage, punishments, anal, etc.). We also talked about a lot of deep stuff and I started to fall for this guy. I told my boyfriend about the feelings I had for the other guy and that we probably shouldn't have a threesome, I also told him we should probably cut all times with him. He said that it was fine and that it would be hotter because of the taboo aspect, and that it would be like unrequited love. I told him this was a bad idea, but he still wanted me to do it. 

So we get to the day of the threesome and my boyfriend cums fast, but still lets me and the other guy finish. You could tell when me and the other guy fucked there was a lot more passion. Later that night my boyfriend liked that another guy could have me and fuck all my holes. But, he said the threesome arrangement wasn't going to work, and he would much rather have an open relationship where both of us would get to fuck other people by ourselves. He would go with multiple people, but I only wanted the threesome guy. This arrangement worked for a couple months, but now my boyfriend says he wants me to cut all ties with the other guy because he feels that he can""t compare to him and that it will affect our sex life. I told him that it wasn't true and that i'm perfectly happy with our sex life, but he doesn't believe me.  He said we could fuck one more time but thats it. So the other guy came to my house and we started fooling around, but during it my boyfriend walked in and saw us. He was livid and said that we should be more careful and what we were doing was disgusting and we should be ashamed. He also was smashing and throwing things. We got into a big fight and he called me a ""worth nothing dirty whore who will take anyones dick"" this hurt a lot because of a past relationship that was verbally abusive. It also reminded me of when we used to fight a lot. When things cooled down he said I was going to have to choose between him and the other guy.
TL;DR
What me and the other guy did was completely consensual and he agreed on it. Why is he mad? What can I do to fix this? Who should I choose?",3,14,tifu

However, we are frequently underfunded and disrespected, especially those of us who actually teach dance and further the art form by passing it on to students. I felt today would be a good day to go to protest outside of Congress about how we are disrespected and our poor pay.

When I posted about this protest on Twitter, I only got two retweets, and one of them was from my son, so I assumed that it'd be quiet. But then all these dancers showed up to protests, and then we were breaking into the Senate, and then I realized the truth- they weren't dancers at all.

Now there's riot police around me and I think I saw the FBI a few minutes ago, and people on Twitter think this whole protest is just people who love Trump, but I've never even voted, I just wanted to make people happy through the movement of my body.

So, to start, my father is an exceptionally angry man. How he got such an excitable woman as my mom, I do not know. As we all know, Covid stole Christmas and this year my husband and I elected not to see all the family this year and have a quiet one at home. (STOP THE SPREAD!)

About a week before Christmas, I was thinking I had to make up for our absense with my mom, because of course she was sad not to see us and her grandbaby on Christmas day. Plus, she has been taking care of my profoundly disabled uncle and dealing with my insane grandmother.

My mistake: I decided to send my mom a glitter bomb. My mother LOVES glitter. I knew it would bring a giant smile to her face to open her shiny craft herpe surprise. So not only did I send her a glitter bomb, but selected the triple glitter option for the extra joy.

It was due to be delivered on Christmas Eve but with the state of the USPS right now, this glitter bomb was delivered yesterday while my mom was at work.  I just need to mention that this was addressed specifically to her and said Merry Christmas on it. Now, NOONE EVER opens her mail. Unopened things often sit around for days before someone touches them. Yet, here I am sharing with you fine folk. 

My father opened the package. My father opened the package and had 3x the glitter rain down upon him after exploding in his face. I wish I was there to see it. As it was described by my brother, he turned purple in his rage. Left the glitter all over. Called my mom to yell at her about it. (Dont worry, she called me at 4:30 this morning saying he deserved it for being a Scrooge on Christmas and she only wishes she was there.)

I can't tell him it was me. He is going to be furious with me forever. He already told my mom he was disappointed that someone would find that funny. Alternatively, Today my father fucked up.

After doing the business, I saw something I‚Äôve not seen in any public toilets before - a welcome innovation. It was a spray bottle filled with water. How helpful, being given all the benefits of wet wipes! I was looking forward to a comfy clean, especially after what my behind had been put through. 

Alas, this where my day took a turn for the worse. That soothing, cool water was not water. 

It was worse. So much worse. It started with a slight warming tingle. Then about ten seconds later, my ass was on fire. Turns out it was not some new initiative for wet tissue, but in fact surface cleaner left in the cubicle. 

It took about an hour and a half to cool down, and the subsequent journey through the Underground was terribly uncomfortable. I‚Äôm still not sure why I did it. In hindsight, I have never seen a tissue wetter before or after that day. But sometimes you just do shit. And I regretted it very much.

t3_kry8f5,Tifu by skimming Google and then burning my eyes.,"So this didn't happen today but 6 months ago, after a very busy day at work. I was very tired after a long shift at work, and after I sat in a park till after midnight smoking with some coworkers. 

Anyway I get home just wanting to go to sleep, and for context I wore contact lenses then, so I had to take them out before going to sleep. Unluckily for me, I had ran out of my regular contact lense solution and had no spares for the next day. I look around in boxes and find a bottle that says 'hydrogen peroxide solution - for contact lenses'. 

Now, I'm not an obvious idiot. But get to know me and you know I ready am one. I know hydrogen peroxide is bad, but it's for contact lenses, which is good right? At this point I just want to sleep and end the mind games, so I do a quick Google of hydrogen peroxide and it's safety in eyes, and it seems good to me. So I went with it. I fill the solution up in the case and take them out the for the next day.

Next day, I wake up a little later. Not too late, so I'm just on auto pilot. When I get to my contacts my eye started hurting, like it was being rejected by my body. When I finally do get it out, I think it's obviously some piece of lint I got caught on the lens. So I wash it out with more of the solution I found.

At this point I'm rushing, I've spent far too long on this and I need to get to work. So I douse both lenses in the solution I found figuring it's a full bottles anyway. The fire that came from this fuck up is definitely 10-15th in the most pain I've felt maybe. I thought I've had worse, they'll just settle in like they always do. 

A few minutes go by and I keep thinking to myself, it's not worth it. Both of my eyes burned with fires of hell as I start flapping about trying to get Satan's toenail clippings out of my eyes. I decided I didn't need to see today, because that isn't worth it. 

On my bus ride to work I had another quick Google and saw you need some kind of neutralising agent or something to not make it hurt. Not too sure, I didn't read it. This experience is also a reason I wear glasses again.

When I was washing my hands however, my ass started to burn a little. I though ""okay I probably just had one of those slightly acidic shits"" or something like that. Then it just kept getting worse, and worse, and worse. I looked back at the packaging of the wipes and saw that they were cleaning wipes... with bleach in them. I wiped my ass with bleach.

Also, I have absolutely terrible memory and have almost no memories of my childhood, so the fact that this one still stuck around kind of shows how traumatic it was. Anyway, my family and I were eating at a Japanese restaurant for what must have been the first time for me because, when the food arrived, I took one look at my plate and assumed the fluffy-looking, bright green glob of paste on the side must have been candy. So, before anyone could stop me, I picked the whole thing up and plopped it in my mouth.

&amp;#x200B;

I instantly realized my mistake as my mouth and nose suddenly turned into active volcanoes. I screamed. Just straight up screamed as loud as my little lungs could. Thankfully, it was a fairly big gathering so the room we were in one of those private little rooms where you sit on the cushions on floor and I was spared the concerned looks of a restaurant full of people. Lord knows what they thought might have been happening. Also fortunately, I was so excited and eager about this fun looking candy that the waiter hadn't even left the room yet and knew to sprint away and get me a soda. And yes, he did a full heel turn and fucking bolted to the kitchen. Looking back, I'm honestly surprised he didn't knock into anyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

It took probably about ten-fifteen minutes and two sodas before I could communicate in anything other than panicked moans and screams, but the pain eventually went away and I survived the great Wasabi Fiasco. Once I was actually able to taste again, the food was actually pretty good the way it was meant to be eaten and my family had a good laugh at my mistake. I was suspicious of wasabi for years afterwards though and I don't think I tried it again until I was in high school.

However, I checked the time and it was 11:58. Over two hours. I overslept and I fucked up. We were now on break but I kept on getting spammed my friends saying how the teacher was asking where I was. My mom texted me because apparently my teacher emailed her about my 'absence'. She was really pissed off and she said I should've just went to bed early which I agree with.

TL;DR I skipped my school meetings by sleeping.",3,5,tifu
t3_krtnxu,TIFU By Repeatedly Saying The Wrong Word During An Important Meeting,"I‚Äôm currently doing a co-op at this one company. Most of my work is just typing up documents for my employer and other companies as means of what‚Äôs currently happening. Basically just updating everything step by step. My supervisor thought it‚Äôd be a great idea for me to run the meetings, which isn‚Äôt bad it‚Äôs just reading words off the document. The thing was that I didn‚Äôt type this document up, my supervisor did and he‚Äôs an amazing guy but he thinks quicker than he types so there was bound to be spelling and grammar errors. 
So I‚Äôm reading along the lines of the document and fixing everything and I came across the word ‚Äúsimulated use.‚Äù I have no idea why I read it wrong but I repeatedly said ‚Äústimulated use.‚Äù The context makes it worse because my line was ‚Äúthis criteria can be found in stimulated use.‚Äù No one said anything but after the meeting my supervisor started dying of laughter. And he told me and now I‚Äôm super embarrassed. 

TLDR: used the word stimulated instead of simulated during a big meeting",3,2,tifu
t3_krtild,TIFU by telling my crush that I liked her,"This was about 10 years ago but I still remember this like it was yesterday, so I was in 9th grade, horny as hell and shit like that. I really wanted a girlfriend, all my friends had one and I felt lonely. It was the day before Valentine‚Äôs Day and all my friends were doing like double dates and shits, of course I wasn‚Äôt invited because I was a loner. so I kind of liked this girl that we will call Ashley for the sake of the story. So I get ready to ask her, I had a single red rose, was wearing my older brothers cologne and wore a semi fancy shirt. I walk down the hall to her locker where she was standing and I was feeling like a hot shot. I tap her on her left shoulder and say,‚Äùwill you be my valentine?‚Äù. I shit you not, she stood there and just stared at me, and after what felt like a lifetime, she said she is not into guys. FUCK. My friends talked about it for months and I still don‚Äôt think I got over that.

t3_krt4l0,TIFU by having morning wood,"So this was way back in them good ole high school days. I was actually in 1st period world geography. So I was dozing off, and ended up in full blown nap mode. 

So time goes by, I'm sleeping so damn good. And next thing I know I hear my name being called by my teacher (who obviously knows I'm sleeping) asking me to come to the front of the class and take the overhead projector to a different class room. 

At this point I realize I'm in quite the pickle. I notice my wood. And it's raging. Like seriously it had some blood flow to it.  The whole class is staring, so no swift positioning my stuff.  So with the class watching me, I awkwardly take off my hoodie (still seated), ball up my hoodie then set it in my lap, and walk to the front of the class holding my hoodie on my groin area acting as natural as possible. Emphasis on ""as possible"".  Grab the projector with one arm and held the hoodie with the other. It is pretty difficult to walk right with an ill positioned boner. Lost the wood pretty quick probably when I got into the hallway. 


TL;DR
Fell asleep in class, developed raging morning wood and got called to the front of the class and awkwardly tried to hide it.",125,23,tifu
t3_krsv07,TIFU by wathcing porn during online class and not muting the mic,"Before you say anything: no, my camera wasn't turned on.

We've been in lockdown since early November here in Hungary, and this was just another usual day, sitting through online classes, trying my best not to daydream. However, this was during German class, which I usually don't pay too much attention to, since I spend a lot of time with my extended family in Vienna, Austria, so I know a decent amount of German. But in spite of all this, the teacher sometimes still calls on me, when no one else can answer the question.

After answering one of these questions, I had the quite questionable idea to watch some porn, but I went along with this hell of an idea nonetheless. Now, I was logged in to class on my PC, but was watching porn on my phone, but I put the phone right in front of my laptop, and there was no headset plugged into the laptop, so everything happening around me can usually be heard.

After a good 5 minutes into the video, one guy let out a rather **audible** moan, which was so loud, that I'm pretty sure even my brother could hear it in the room next to mine. I quickly lowered the volume, but when I took a quick glance at my laptop screen, I noticed that after answering the question, I forgot to turn off my mic. That, combined with the sudden influx of Messenger notifications on my phone, quickly led me to the realisation:

# They heard the moan!

With shaking hands, I opened the group chat, and like 6-7 people were simultaniously asking ""did y'all hear the moan"" ""what was that moan"" and other questions like this. Scared and scarred, I typed ""tf was that"" into the group chat, muted my mic and starred at the laptop until the end of the class, questioning my life decisions. No one actually said anything during the online class, so I don't know exactly how many people have heard it, or if the teacher could hear it, but that was a uniquely interesting experience.

TL;DR.: I watched porn during online class without muting my mic and they heard the moaning.",339,49,tifu
t3_krsmvl,TIFU By Convincing My Sister that Rats lay Eggs,"This happened just a few minutes ago,

But first some background this afternoon my Sister and I were talking about random things to pass time, and I thought to prank her, and so I just randomly very nonchalantly said ""Did you know that Rats lay eggs"".

She didn't believe me, but was not sure, so I said to google it, and I thought this would be where this would end and I would have a good laugh that she even considered this to be true.

But when she googled (Do rats lay eggs?), and this showed up:

Google Confirmed that Yes Indeed! Rats give 4 eggs at a time on the home page, and my sister was so shocked that she didn't even open the link, because she thought I knew this and apparently was just informing her of a known fact.
 Link for Reference:

https://www.google.com/search?q=do+rats+lay+eggs&amp;oq=do+rats+lay+eggs&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i22i30l4.3092j0j7&amp;client=ms-unknown&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8

She now seemed to believe this and I couldn't believe my luck that some Google Article had convinced her that rats lay eggs, so I kept teasing her saying: How did you not know this ?, What do they teach you at school? etc, at which point she got angry and left and I had a good laugh and thought that to be the end.

But that's where I fucked up, My Sister at dinner today while talking to my mom about her day, told her she found out today that rats lay eggs, which caused me to nearly choke on my food, but managed to pass it as just a cough, and my mom thought it was a joke as well and snorted at this too, but when my sister kept insisting that ( Rats do Lay Eggs ), she began to get angry, and when apparently to prove her point she showed her the Google page, she began saying stuff like Kids These Days believe anything, Fairy tales and stuff, that's when my sister began to get angry too.

They both got into a shouting match, which quickly devolved into things other than the Egg Laying Rat, which led to my Sister getting her Phone Privileges taken away until "" she learns some manners "" and is also grounded for a Month.

My sister is now in her room fuming and I am here writing this stuff to reddit, I feel really bad for my sister and scared that this could turn on me too, if it gets out that I told her this, What should I do, Would like some advice :(

TL;DR I convinced my sister that Rats lay eggs which by a stroke of luck was confirmed by Google, when she told my mom this at dinner they both got in a shouting match both refusing to back down, which ended with my sister's phone being taken away and her being grounded for a month.",16,12,tifu
t3_krsiqf,TIFU by giving my friend the wrong phone number,"**TL;DR: In 2017 I fucked up and lost a friend by giving him the wrong phone number. Only realized what happened last week.**

So to start this story I need to introduce a few characters. There's me (OP), Friend A, Friend B (all late-20s M) and my girlfriend (mid-20s F). One more key detail: my girlfriend's ex has the same first name as B. They had a rough breakup long before we met.

I've been friends with A since kindergarten. We met B in early high school and the 3 of us were a ""friend group"". We never really hung out with anyone else, just the three of us. We'd spend every day together in school and after graduating we still hung out every weekend. At one point we all had girlfriends and they'd hang out with us too, but at the time of this incident B and C were single.

A couple years post-high school, B started to feel like a third wheel in our group. Friend A and I had known each other a lot longer, had a few inside jokes, and never really hung out with B 1-on-1. It was either me and A together or all 3 of us. So B started coming around less and less over a couple months, and then we stopped seeing him all together.

I realized what was happening and made a conscious effort to be better friends with B. I talked to him more often, did more things with him 1-on-1, and simply tried to avoid any situation that made him feel excluded. This helped improve things and we were starting to hang out again.

One night in 2017, I was hanging out with Friend B to watch hockey and drink beer. He opened up to me for the first time and said that he was very happy about being included more and he was sorry about ghosting us for a while. He had a new phone and asked me to give him A's number so we could arrange for us to all hang out again soon.

This is where I fucked up. Nobody bothers to remember phone numbers any more. Besides my parents, the only numbers I know off by heart are for my girlfriend and Friend A. After a few beers, I got those two phone numbers mixed up. *I accidentally gave my girlfriend's number to B.* At some point over the next couple days, B texted my girlfriend (thinking it was A).

&gt;**Hey this is \[B\], I got a new number. We should definitely hang out some time soon. \[OP\] too.**

My girlfriend received this text out of the blue and thought it was from her ex, also named B. He had reached out a few times since we'd been dating and tried to get back with her, so this was a very strange and unwelcome message. She responded:

&gt;**No thanks. \[OP\] and I want nothing to do with you. Feel free to lose this number.**

Sounds a little harsh but not really when you know the history between my girlfriend and her ex, a guy who has tried several times to get back with her years later. She even told me about this at the time and I didn't piece it together. She said she got a text from her ex asking to hang out and I didn't question it.

I spoke to B a few more times in the coming weeks and he was clearly distant. He told me he didn't want to hang out with A and we only saw each other two or three more times before he basically cut all contact with both of us. I never heard about the text exchange from B, and obviously A never mentioned it because it wasn't him.

Fast forward 3+ years, and I'm hanging out with girlfriend going through old screenshots. She finds one of that text conversation and shows it to me. The second I see it I realize what happened. I have no idea why it clicked now and not before. That was last week, and I have since texted B and messaged him on fb but no response. I think what's done is done, and I ruined a friendship by giving out the wrong number.",19,6,tifu

Nothing happened but I got suspicious and tried to delete it. Windows wouldn‚Äôt let me delete the file, not even via cmd. I wanted to enter safe mode to  delete it so I restarted the computer. As soon as it booted a message was shown. It said that all my files were deleted, which i don‚Äòt believe because that would have taken more time. Still, it was blocking me to access Windows so immediately shut down the pc. I then walked downstairs to my mom and told it to her. There are a lot of very important photos and videos on this pc, which are absolutely priceless to my mom. I think we now have to get some kind of technical support or something, just because I am stupid enough to download a Plugin that costs 100$ for free.

t3_krqw8l,TIFU by letting a woman get stalked,"This happend 15 minutes ago and I'm still overwhelmed. I see these stories everyday on Reddit and I never thought this would happen infront of my eyes.

 I was on my way home on an empty road and I saw a car parked in the middle of the road, man inside and engine on. I didn't think much of it. There was a woman in her 30s standing on the sidewalk and typing on her phone right next to the car. As I walk by she gave me a look, I felt like she needed help, I didn't do anything but I remained very suspicious. Once I got away from them I kept looking over my shoulder to make sure everything is fine, once the woman starts walking away slowly and the car slowly catches up to her, she makes a stop the car does too. She speeds up the car does too. That's when I realized that the look really meant something.

I regret not doing anything, or not going back to her. Because I didn't know what to do or say, it was daylight and around the corner (10 meters away from them) all the shops were open and there were many people in that area so I thought once she gets there she will be fine. I'm worried and I'll blame myself if I hear on the news that something happend to a woman from that area, I hope nothing bad happend to her.

tl;dr: walked next to woman being stalked, didn't realize she was being stalked until i got far away from her.",4,5,tifu

t3_krptbe,TIFU by wanting to shape my eyebrows,"This happened about an hour ago, and I still feel awful.


Bit of backstory; I live in a very rural area with ~1500 people, give or take. Everyone knows everyone, and I've lived here the vast majority of my life.

I also suffer pretty badly with mental health, and have been on medication for the past 5 or so years. There is one pharmacy where I live, which I go to every week. I have gotten to know the staff quite well.


Okay, so today I decided that my eyebrows needed tidying up. Quarantine has not been kind to them, and the look of having shrubbery on my face was not a good one. 
Tried plucking them this morning, lasted about 10 seconds before giving up because that shit hurts, and went back to my desk to go on with work. Decided my hairy caterpillar brows will live to see another day.


Lunchtime hits, and I need to get my medication for the week so I go down to my local pharmacy. Go to the counter, ask for my prescription, yada yada, same as every week.

Then I noticed they had dermablades for sale, and I've heard they are very good for shaping your brows.

For those unfamiliar, they're basically a razor on a stick that you can use on your face.

So there I am, anti depressants and anti psychotics in one hand, and razors on a stick in the other hand, grinning like a mad man because I'm very pleased with myself for finding a pain free way to do my eyebrows.


The pharmacist, who I've gotten to know quite well over the years, instantly looks upset and worried. But fucking empty brain me did not put 2 and 2 together, and continued chatting to her like I always would.

Eventually she asked if I'd like to talk and took me into that separate room you would use for consultations, and asked me if I'm struggling, and if I have any plans to harm myself. This sweet lady was genuinely concerned I was in a very dark place, and just wanted to help me.

I quickly assured her that I am not going to do that at all, I just wanted nice eyebrows and ironically was too much of a little bitch to deal with the pain of plucking.


I feel so incredibly bad for worrying that sweet poor soul. I just wanted cute brows



TLDR; too much of a bitch to pluck my eyebrows, went to the pharmacy to pick up psychiatric medication, bought some face razors, and made a sweet old lady think I was going to try and injure myself.",21,4,tifu

My    husband, brother, and I were going to a casino for a small getaway    vacation. My mother volunteered to stay at my house and watch my dogs    while we were away for a few days. She would be over in a few hours, so I    was cleaning the house. A package arrived at my door, which ended up    being a fox tail butt plug and ears I purchased a few weeks prior. I    opened it and put it on my bed... My super conservative Church of  Christ   mother comes over to watch the dogs. We are casually talking,  while I   show her things around the house. I walk into the room, and my  dumb ass   totally forgets I have the butt plug on the bed. My mother  quickly  steps  against the wall with her eyes widened. She asks, ""Do I  have to  watch  that too?"", while pointed at the bed. My cheeks turned  red, as I  did not  know what to say! I just asked, ""what?!"" She  replied, the  RACCOON! My  mother legit believes I have a raccoon  hanging out on my  bed. I bust out  in laughter, with her still  mortified of this creature.  I do have a  history of having weird  animals, so this makes sense to me  that she had  that belief. I quickly  grab the butt plug and toss it in  the closet,  while she decided to  now be okay with it and very gently  ""petted it"".  NOW SHE BELIEVES I  COMMITTED SOME HORRIBLE ANIMAL ABUSE. I  tell her not  to worry about  it, and it will be fine. After much  convincing it is  nothing that will  die, we are able to leave. I told my  brother and my  husband on the  way what happened, and we all had a  great laugh.

It   was about a month  later at a restaurant that we told her what it was.  I  am not sure if  she was more upset her daughter is not vanilla, that   tail butt plugs or  a thing, or the fact she petted it.

t3_krn1bo,TIFU- should have known it felt too good,"Many years ago on my first ever date we're sat in the cinema with our arms on the armrests with pinkies slowly getting closer and closer. That first ever romantic touch to another human was electric when the fingers brushed and she didn't recoil. So, I'm in a pretty blissful state and over the next hour things progress astonishingly quickly (by the standards of my life at the time) to the point where we're now fully holding hands and our arms are interlocked, i.e. my arm is on her side of the shared armrest and hers is on my side. 

Just when I think things can't get any better, she reaches over with her other hand and starts stroking my forearm. I obviously reciprocate and start stoking her forearm too, just gently up and down. I was convinced this was the happiest anyone had ever been. Even now, when I'm familiar with the fulness of physical joys, I'd still say the combination of simplicity, passion, innocence and chemistry of that moment are pretty unrivalled. I let out the tiniest moan of happiness. As I'm in that moment, I feel something with my finger but think nothing of it, I see her look down though. She looks confused, so I look down, and it turns out that our two hands hit. She's already figured it out, but it took me a moment to realise that for the last few minutes we've both been stroking my forearm and our fingers just hit.
She recoils, I sit there motionless, I think back to those stupid games where you try and guess how many fingers are drawing on your back but you can't tell, then I panic that she thinks I'm some selfish self-pleasuring freak. She sits back and watches the rest of the movie with her arms folded. I plan what to say or do at the end of the movie and come up with the foolproof plan of just pretending nothing happened. She one-upped this plan by proceeding to pretend I never happened. 

Still have the happy memory of my first touch though!

With the world being what it is money has been very tight and losing my job at this moment in time has been pretty catastrophic for us financially.

There was a suggestion to do a little fooling around virtually and against my better judgement I decided to go along with it. It was awkward and I ended up being convinced to jerk off on cam, again against my better judgment but the horny demon is always trying.

t3_krn5k2,TIFU by being vegan and possibly giving my family botulism,"I  am vegan. My husband is not. For New Year‚Äôs Eve we ordered a giant box  of Mediterranean food that was mostly vegan with a few non-vegan sauces  for the husband. Last night, I was looking to use up the last of the  nonvegan garlic sauce. Since it's only a few days old I figured it had  to be fine and mixed it into my husband‚Äôs portion of spaghetti.

As  hubby takes his plate to the TV to eat I hear him in the other room  going, ‚ÄúOh god! Oh god!‚Äù I think, damn, he really likes it. Until he  marches back into the kitchen announcing that it was bad, off, no good.  ‚ÄúIt tastes like chemicals!‚Äù he says. I take a bite off his plate,  because that‚Äôs what people do when something is bad. The militant vegans  will probably be here soon to tell me that this single action probably  took out a big section of the Amazon and killed the last forest fairy  but anyway. I still think it‚Äôs fine but except for these stolen bites  I‚Äôve been vegan for a long time, so maybe I can‚Äôt tell anymore. We dump  his plate, throw out the rest of the sauce, feed him off of my portion  of dinner, and resolve to have ice cream later to make it up.

Except  something is nagging me. After I finish my dinner I go back to  the  garbage can and pull the sauce out. It‚Äôs kinda...bubbly. I can jellies  and vegetables sometimes and start freaking out: *oh my god I just ate botulism.*  I call out for husband. My vision is greying. I am having a panic  attack. We live in an urban area, hospitals are at capacity with COVID,  and *I just gave us botulism.*

Husband  tells me to calm down as I'm taking off my sweater and pants to get  maximum airflow on this rolling ball of overheating anxiety attack.  Botulism doesn‚Äôt taste bad, he says. I challenge him to show me where an  authority says that something that tastes bad can‚Äôt coexist with  botulism. I decide while he‚Äôs doing that I‚Äôm going to return to the arms  of my teenage fling with bulimia.

After  I‚Äôm done horking up enough mangled spaghetti and bread to convince  myself that that cursed stolen spoonful of botulism must have come out  too, I clean up and rejoin my husband. He says, show me this sauce. So  we go to the fridge, in which I‚Äôve wrapped up the remaining sauce in  order for the  CDC to test it for botulinum when I am in the hospital  with paralyzed vocal cords. My husband examines it, prods it, and  suddenly sticks his finger in it to taste it before I can stop him.  ‚ÄúHuh,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThat tastes good,"" he announces. ‚ÄúSomething else must  have tasted funny! You‚Äôll be fine!‚Äù Husband comes in for a kiss.

I  stop him from all that. Not only am I relatively fresh from a 10 minute  fling with the toilet but he‚Äôs somehow got stuff all over his wildman  COVID beard. It looks like...clear butter?

Husband stops in his tracks. ‚ÄúOh my god,"" he says. ""I ate hand sanitizer.‚Äù

Um what.

You  see, he had to go physically to work today, which fortunately is rare,  and while continually sanitizing his hands, was somehow also managing to  sanitize his beard, with globs and globs of hand sanitizer. Now, my  husband is not a gracious eater. Apparently, he combed his fork of  spaghetti through the hand sanitizer. The spaghetti was just along for  the ride.

And yet: I feel like *crap*  today. Is my digestion messed up from the animal products in that  cursed bite of garlic sauce? Is my system upset at throwing up last  night (like...a lot)? Do I have COVID? Do I have botulism? **Who knows.** Welcome to 2021, spin the wheel and claim your prize.

If  my Reddit account goes unusually quiet, assume I‚Äôm paralyzed from  botulism after all I guess. My husband may just have to go on through  this cruel world eating hand sanitizer without me.

TL;DR : I am a vegan who can't tell if animal-based food is safe to eat, and my husband is a caveman who thinks hand sanitizer is edible.",18296,925,tifu
t3_krm5dp,TIFU by educating the younger generation,"This TIFU should actually be a TDIFU (the day I fucked up) as the actual fuck up happened a few weeks back, but the effect became apparent only today. 

My cousins and I (30 M) are really close since they live just down the road, and they‚Äôre 7, 10 and 12 respectively. 

A week before TDIFU, the oldest comes up to me and asks: ‚Äúdo you know any good cartoons?‚Äù 

I gladly introduce them to the joys of one punch man. They frikkin loved it. 

Cut to a week later.

They show me their favourite clips of Saitama one punching stuff (kudos to them, they love the Boros fight) on YouTube. I tell them that I know where to find more, full episodes, in chronological order, and in Japanese (which I told them was the only way to watch anime). Their eyes grew wide with excitement, as I showed them the website where they could watch at their leisure.

They went ballistic, everything they loved was on there, Beyblade, Ben 10, Adventures of Gumball, Fairly Odd Parents, the works.

The oldest then looks to me with the most amazed look, and asks how I know about this holy animated sanctum, and without thinking I tell him:‚Äù the internet is a wonderful place, you can find anything and everything you want to look at or watch! Just tell me what you want, I‚Äôll show you!‚Äù

Do you guys see where this is going?

So the youngest says she wants to see sea otters, and I bring up the google image search.

The second wants to know more superheroes, so I take him to the Marvel wiki (he didn‚Äôt like it, too many words).

The oldest just has the most stupefied look on his face, and says that he thinks he knows how to use this ‚Äúinternet‚Äù.

To make sure, I coached him through, telling him about how to search effectively. I taught him about viruses and information he should never reveal on the internet. To top it off, I helped all three of them create their first email address, variations of virusgod, beybladeking, and elsaanna!

Happy days!

At this very moment, a couple of weeks have passed.

I‚Äôm at their place now, hiding outside having a smoke, dinner will be served soon.

It‚Äôs my uncle‚Äôs birthday. 

The situation is a little tense. All three of them are sulking, their devices have been taken away from them.

My dad asked, their mom says it‚Äôs because they weren‚Äôt using the devices properly.

My usually boisterous uncle is very tense for a birthday boy, and is only offering terse answers. 

I think I know what happened.

I can hear them calling for me, dinner is served. 

Thank goodness they haven‚Äôt ratted me out. 

TL:DR: taught kids the wonders of the internet and stole their childhood innocence

Update:

Out for my post dinner smoke. 

The atmosphere has loosened up, and their most memorable search histories are in, the oldest searched for variations of ‚ÄúBrianna naked‚Äù (he says it‚Äôs some YouTuber), the second searched for ‚Äúsexy girl fighting‚Äù, and the youngest searched for ‚Äúfarting butt‚Äù. Paid parental controls have been installed (by me).

t3_krlzgv,TIFU by having my bestfriend sleep over,"Obligatory this didn‚Äôt happen today but 3 nights ago.

Sorry if this breaks any rules.

Information:
My bestfriend (F17) and I (M17) have been best friends for over a year now since we have a lot of classes together and just instantly got along. During this time we‚Äôve both had feelings for one another but nothing ever came from it since we were in other relationships. But when we were both single we tried it out, we both were so happy and had a lot of fun, but decided it would be best just to remain friends to not ruin the strong friendship we had.

3 months ago she started to like this guy and vice versa. They went on several dates but since they are both very shy and scared of rejection, they never asked eachother out or went for a kiss. They text eachother 24/7 and she has practically half his wardrobe. Over the past month he has been away visiting family, but he‚Äôs always been jealous of me so my bestfriend always has to lie to him when we hangout so he doesn‚Äôt have to worry. Since they started talking I haven‚Äôt tried anything with her so there shouldn‚Äôt be a reason he should be worried. 


So to the story. 
Three nights ago our mutual friend hosted her going away dinner the night before she left. Wanting to make the most of it, my bestfriend and her asked if they could sleep over at my place. Before this no girls have ever slept over at my place because of a strict but loving mum, but to our amazed mum said yes. 

So after the dinner they both come back to mine where we end up watching ‚ÄòUs‚Äô. During the movie the three of us sit on the couch with the mutual friend on the end, my best friend in the middle and me on the other end. Like several times before my bestfriend rests her head on my shoulder. As the movie progresses and starts getting scarier, to my dismay we started holding hands, then hand on her thigh to my arms around her and finally to cuddling. This is completely shocking to me since all she talks about is her crush and how when he gets back they‚Äôll start dating, but I definitely am not complaining since she is absolutely stunning. 

The movie finishes around 1am where the mutual friend decides to go to bed. So I offer her if she wants to go to sleep in my bed whilst my bestfriend and I continue on to a second movie and she agrees. 

Whilst the second movie starts we start flirting hard which eventually leads to kissing. The two of us end up making out for over an hour which is the most passionate and amazing time I‚Äôve ever had. The kissing leads to other stuff until she asks if I want to have sex. But the problem was that I didn‚Äôt have any condoms since my ex was on birth control and had the implant. But thankfully she says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you think a woman comes prepared‚Äù and hurry‚Äôs off to get them from my bedroom without waking our mutual friend up. The combination of the nerves and it being 3:30 in the morning, I couldn‚Äôt get it up. She was totally cool about it and understanding where at 4am we both went to bed, she slept in my bed with the mutual friend whilst I slept on the floor. 

This is where the fuck up happens. I knew the kissing and flirting and everything was a one off but I had caught feelings. It was so hard not to, with the constant affection for hours and just her being amazing it was inevitable. Although I was happy to go along and continue with it, I just felt used and hurt. I knew nothing would happen between us because how much she likes her soon to be boyfriend but somehow the smallest bit of me has caught feelings. 

TL;DR:
My bestfriend stayed over the night where we hooked up but I had caught feelings whilst she likes another guy.",4,12,tifu
t3_krlf57,TIFU by measuring my wheelie bin.,"So today I (14M) was in my online science class and the teacher gave us a task to measure household objects. One of those objects was a wheelie bin so I decided to go out and do that experiment. So as you do when your about to measure your wheelie bin i wheeled it to a discreet location in between my dads car and the wall where I then got to it using my ruler(couldn‚Äôt be bothered to find a tape measure) to measure the size in cm of my wheelie bin. So I am just about finished with this incredibly valuable experiment that I am working on and I turn around to see the girl from next door (who has only just moved in and I have never met before) who had just got back from her run was giving me the weirdest...fucking... stare I have ever experienced that was clearly just screaming ‚ÄúWHAT IN ALL THATS HOLY IS THAT LAD DOING‚Äù. Now me being socially awkward just locked eyes with her frantically trying to think what to do next. Now a normal person in this situation would laugh it off and explain‚Äù haha yeah I‚Äôve got to do this for a science experiment‚Äù and everyone would laugh and go on their merry way. Right? However this is me we‚Äôre talking about. So I decided just to look at the floor and practically run back into my house when the girl was still watching me probably wondering what the hell was wrong with me from a distance. No explanation. I didn‚Äôt even say hi and act like I was doing something perfectly normal. No. I just fucking ran like a constipated penguin back to my front door. I can only imagine what she thought I was doing and I feel like the biggest imbecile to walk this earth right now. She probably is now telling all her friends that she has a wheelie bin measuring weirdo for a next door neighbour. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve cringed so hard in my life.

t3_krlcit,TIFU by not staying with him,"Obligatory ""not today"" this happened 38 years ago but I only realised today it was a fuck up and this is about a gay experience, so don't read if that bothers you.

When I (58M) was 20, naive, unexperienced and in college. I read an article in the college newspaper about a gay bar and for some reason was curious and decided to go and check it out. I had, at least in my memory, never really had a thing for men.

When I walked in the first time, I was extremely nervous and very surprised to see a few men that I knew from college, work, etc.. I sort of migrated to one that I knew who did the design of the stores windows in the retail place I worked at and hung out with him for a while. The whole time I was there, I was being asked to dance, given free drinks, ass was being pinched, and being rubbed against by men. It was a hot, exciting night but I was so overwhelmed and confused, I just hung out with my friend until it got to be too much for me and I went home.

The thing is, I kept going to the gay bar and usually ended up hanging out with my friend and it got to the point that were beginning to be know as a couple and I sort of liked it. We danced a lot, did the poppers thing while dancing and grew closer and the sexual atmosphere was really hot but I was nervous, naive and just scared of what it all meant for me if I was ‚Äúgay‚Äù. He was really patient with me and I knew he wanted me in every way possible and I wanted him too but scared.

One night we ended up in his place after the bar and took something to relax. I lost all inhibitions that night and had the best sex of my life. He fucked me and I came without even touching myself, I fucked him and swallowed his load, we sucked each other off and collapsed hours late in sweaty pile in a spoon position with him holding my cock as we cuddled.

I really think that I loved him, but couldn‚Äôt deal with the fact that I might be gay, what it would mean and pulled back from him. I still went to the bar, ended up in bed with several other men, even got a hickey on my neck from one guy the night before I went out on a date with a woman who ended up being the love of my university life, fortunately my roommate at the time applied make up to cover the hickeys.

Looking back on it, I really wish that I had stayed with him and at least let the relationship run it‚Äôs course but I was so scared. I got older, got married, had a child, became a single dad and have been questioning my sexuality ever since. I have hit the gay saunas, blown as many men as I could there and am still scared of being gay.

I love women and am not generally attracted to men, just their cocks but I think that I really fucked up not staying with him.

TLDR was so scared of being gay, that I left a guy who might have been Mr Right.

Edit: added gay subject warning, seems to be upsetting people",34,28,tifu

I‚Äôve been having some difficulty sleeping recently, but I found that if I read before bed, I usually get drowsy enough to fall asleep for an hour or two. I recently began reading *The Great Old Ones: the Complete Works of HP Lovecraft* and I‚Äôve really been enjoying it. I heard that his work was foundational for modern horror, but up until this point, his writing had just struck me as somewhat eerie at best. Enjoyable to read, just not as spooky as I thought they‚Äôd be.

I found that some of his stories could be a little dry, or perhaps too experimental for my taste, so I looked up which story I should read next. This is the fuck up.

I look online and see a story called *The Rats in the Walls*. Sounds spooky, so I jump into it. Man, do I regret that decision. 

I am a fully grown, adult, man. I pay bills. I‚Äôm in a committed relationship. I do my own oil changes. I am also now completely covered in blankets to protect myself from the wrath of these imaginary rats. Arms are tucked in. Blanket is tucked under my feet. The works.

t3_krkw2x,TIFU by saying the right thing to the wrong person.,"Admittedly this happened about 5 years ago, and after telling a friend this story she encouraged me to share it with you fine fucker uppers. I'm writing this from my phone so excuse any poor formatting and/or waffling on.

Going back about 5 years and I was working at the local garage as a tyre fitter/mechanic, the work was pretty mindless but the guys I worked with were all good value and we all got along really well, we still occasionally catch up and I still cope a bit of flak for this fuck up. 

Anyway one morning before I got there someone had dropped in a set of 4 brand new wheels to have 4 new tyres fitted, my boss (a bit of a hardass who owned the shop and also another across town) asked me to have it done within the hour because the person who owned the wheels would be back in to have them fitted to the car at about (x) time. Piece of cake. As I'm fitting the tyres I admire the wheels that I'm working on, they were genuine forged wheels, about 10"" wide with a deep dish and looked extremely expensive, so I thought somehow I will compliment the owner on his choice of wheels when I see him. I finished fitting the tyres and move onto the next job. 

Fast forward a little bit and I have to leave the store to go get parts for said next job, when I return there is a different car on my hoist and a colleague had already removed the wheels, he let me know that this was the vehicle that was to have the brand new wheels fitted and that the customer was in the waiting room. I got right to work, within about 10minutes it was done and I drove the car off the hoist and into the carpark. My work colleague and I both remarked on how good the car looked with it's new feet, I thought now's my chance to go and compliment the customer on his choice of wheels. 

We both go into the waiting room where there is only one customer sitting and the first thing I said to him was ""far out mate those wheels looks great, they must have cost you an arm and a leg!!"" I have never seen someone's facial expression change so fast, complete elation to explosive anger in a fraction of a second. My colleague gaps it out of the room as he obviously sensed the impeding doom whilst I am none the wiser, then the abuse began.. ""You're a real funny fucker aren't you?! Must think you're real cool taking the mick out of someone else's misfortune, go get your boss before I punch your fucking lights out!"" Etc etc etc. This went on for about a minute, I locked up, not knowing what to say or do because I had no idea what I'd done, I stutter a bunch but eventually do what he said and I went to go get my boss, who by this point had heard the swearing and yelling and knew something was up. He told me to go make a cup of coffee and he'll see if he can get to the bottom of it. 

I go to the break room where I find my colleague doubled over in the corner wetting himself with uncontrollable laughter. He's trying to tell me something but can't get the words out in between bouts of hysterics, eventually he gets it across... ""That dude, he was in a motorbike accident a while ago, he's got a prosthetic leg and a false arm.."" then once again breaking out in hysterics. The significance of this didn't quite dawn on me until I recounted what I had initially said to him. My heart sunk and I felt like the biggest piece of shit, all the while my work mate thinks it is literally the funniest thing he has ever witnessed.

As it turns out the guy was so mad because he had told my colleague about his accident earlier,  assumed we were all aware of his disability/situation and therefore my comment about paying for his wheels with an arm and leg was me making a premeditated malicious joke at his expense.. fuccccckkkkkk

Customer grudgingly paid his bill, left the shop unhappy vowing to never come back, and then wrote a bad review on Google. I got a barrelling from my boss about paying more attention but mostly the vibe from it was shit happens get back to work and make me more money.

Unknowingly made fun of a disabled person, got the company I work for a bad google review. Still feel terrible.",25,2,tifu

I was a very edgy teen, but I usually tried my best not to draw much attention to myself or make much of a commotion- until my senior year, first period humanities class. I had a teacher who was the devil incarnate.
Mrs. Smith (name substituted for privacy) was an extremely catholic ~50 year old woman, I was a 17 year old gay and trans teen. I had never felt that much hatred and dread about a teacher, in my entire school career. She dragged on our section on Christianity and the Bible for so much of the term that every other topic. we were supposed to learn about was limited to 2 days per lesson. It was absolutely bonkers! The end of the term was nearing, and we got to our unit on period architecture, and as a wrap up activity, we took a field trip to the closest cathedral. Mrs. Smith was so thrilled about this trip, she was up to her eyeballs in holy excitement, she could not contain how important it was to her. Every class she taught, all 5 of the periods, were coming on the trip! Which meant that my best friend in her 3rd period was to come too. The day comes, and Mrs. Smith and the tour guide lead us around the (incredibly beautiful, breathtaking even) building. We stepped through the doors, and it was quiet, the whole place echoed with every noise, every shuffle, but everyone was in awe of the stained glass windows and vaulted ceilings, so they didn't have much to say yet. Except for me.

""Amanda, look at that fancy water fountain!""

I pointed my best friend to the holy water receptical that was hollowed into one of the nearby walls, a joke I meant to be just for her.

I have never heard my voice so loud in my entire life. It bounced off of every surface in the whole place. I don‚Äôt think I have seen anyone as enraged or embarrassed as Mrs. Smith was, ever. Not in my entire life. She was absolutely fuming, she looked like she would cry or explode or maybe keel over. 

She didn't look me in the eye, for the remaining 3 weeks of the term. I became a ghost to her in that classroom, and frankly, I cannot blame her!

Exactly two years ago today, my dad was diagnosed with a very rare and aggressive cancer of the duodenum. It was rapid, within 3 months he went from completely normal, to me giving the go ahead along with my brother for the DNR after he was intubated in the ICU. 

Everything went so fast, I feel like I got whiplash from it all. But anyway, my dad was prescribed very intense opiod painkillers. Stuff that only people in end of life care could get, specifically because he was a cancer patient. He was prescribed a variety of pain killing medication because od how intense his cancer was, and almost none of them worked. He was addicted the opiods, but they only ever offered a moments respite, before he was shouting in pain again.

It was very painful, not knowing what to do.  When he passed away we had more than a pharamcies worth of the stuff. I don't even remember the dosage, but I believe it was around 4 mg of fentanyl for the pills, which had absolutely no effect on him. Eventually he got the patches, but those caused their own set of problems so we discarded them for the less effective, but more accessible pills. At least when he wasn't in admittance at a hospital, which was very rare because of his pain

Every year, for as long as I remember, I get cluster headaches for a certain period of the year, which just so happened to conveniently be around the time he passed away, and the dust was starting to settle. Me, and my bright idea was to take one of these pills, with absolutely no tolerance to opiods, knowing and seeing, first hand, what opiod addiction can do to a person, because I just couldn't stand the headaches that day.  When I took it, I felt fine. But I felt very drowsey soon after, I slept for almost 14 hours after taking it. I didn't even realize I could have died from an overdose.

Pretty soon after, I  looked up the proper procedures to disposing of the fentanyl, and washed my hands completely of the stuff. I really wanted nothing to do with it, but looking back I could have easily died from what I did.

t3_krj01u,TIFU by trying to rescue a cat in a trap.,"Tifu by trying to rescue a cat. I was walking in the woods and spotted a cat with it's leg caught in a dog proof trap. It wasn't my trap. The cat was flipping out, screaming, and trying to free his leg. I went home and got some welding gloves and a screwdriver to open the trap with.

When I returned, there was a dog barking at the cat, and it was even more agitated. As I approached it would continue to wrap the chain around the tree it was attached to. I continued this until it's leg was starting to bend around the tree as well. He stretched his body away from me and was quite pissed about the situation. I just couldn't leave him there. 

I put a coat on and the heavy leather welding gloves on and tried to hold it still so he couldn't tear me up or hurt himself. Almost instantly it bit through the gloves and into my hand. I pulled back and waited for a minute. Then I tried again, this time thinking that I could get the back of it's neck and calm it like I have done with a kitten before. A terrible idea in hindsight, but I really thought it would buy me enough time. This time it somehow turned it's head towards my fingers, sunk it's teeth into my ring and pinky finger, and ripped the pads off of my fingers. I jerked my hand back losing the glove, and it just kept chewing up the glove like it was my hand. These were deep bites, and a lot of blood from the missing skin that used to be a fingerprint. The shock made it feel pretty numb at first. 

I did get the trap open without restraining the cat finally. Originally I thought it would try to attack, but it just made a big scene while I worked. It tried to stay as far from me as possible. He is fine, and ran away, jumping in the air, and climbing trees. Hopefully without a newfound taste for my blood lol.

In hindsight, I would have put my coat over the cat to protect myself, and the cat. I would have never dreamed it was possible for it to do so much damage through these gloves. Now that I'm thinking clearly, I can remember my cats crunching through bones when they eat scraps, or kill rabbits. I might be lucky I still have a finger. 

I hope I am wiser now.

tl;dr : I tried to rescue a trapped cat, wore gloves, and still got injured pretty good. The cat is fine.

Edit: Thank you for advising me to get a rabies and tetanus shot. I had not considered this until you guys reminded me of it. I will call my doctor's office asap. Thanks for taking the time to let me know the danger.

Edit2: Turns out, first day I had to get two shots in each finger that got bit, then in my shoulder, and one in each butt cheek. I have four more rounds to go over the next 28 days. The next round won't be near as bad. It will just be split between the shoulders and butt. It would have only been 14 days if I wasn't on immune therapy and chemotherapy.",69,22,tifu
t3_kriyx4,TIFU by using too much Bengay,"So this happened about 30 minutes ago. 
*Note for context: 
Me:28
Husband:31*

I have a bad back and threw it out earlier today by just walking around my house. I called my dr but due to covid I couldn‚Äôt get an appointment and all the urgent cares in the area were full. Normally I get a few muscle relaxers and move on but since I couldn‚Äôt see anyone in person I decided to deal with the issue the ‚Äúold fashioned way‚Äù. 

My husband went and got Advil and Bengay. My dr recommended it along with epsom salt baths. 

I laid down and he put the Bengay on my back and then helped me to the couch. The ‚Äúhot‚Äù feeling it gives actually helped and made my back feel better. 
This lasted about 3.5 hours. 

A few more hours later and it was time for bed and another round of Bengay. My husband was tired and didn‚Äôt put on the same amount that he did earlier. I asked him to put more on as we joked around. 

He put on so much Bengay that I‚Äôm pretty sure the neighbors think a bus full of old people must have parked in our neighborhood. He rubbed it in and we joked about the smell. 

Here‚Äôs where the problem occurs. My back starts to burn. Not in the good way from earlier but from a skin on a hot stove kind of way. To make matters worse my husband thought it would funny to ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù put some cream in the top part of my bottom. 

After some screaming, crying, and a lot of laughter we were able to get enough layers of the cream scraped off to make things more manageable. 

I got into bed and still feel a little extra hotness but it‚Äôs nothing I can‚Äôt handle but then this weird sensation kicked in and I realized my top bottom is tingly and on fire. 

My husband is laughing so hard the bed is shaking as I‚Äôm complaining that my butts gonna burn for the next 3 hours or so. 

We both find the whole thing funny and now know not to use too much Bengay when we‚Äôre older. 

TL;DR: 
Bengay burns. Don‚Äôt slather it on like it will save your soul and do not put it near your butt.",1,0,tifu
t3_kris06,TIFU by trying edibles at a concert.,"       Buckle your seatbelts, this is a good one. Granted, this was a few years ago, but this is the perfect place to expose myself. 
         Alright, so I found out Slayer was doing their farewell tour, and of course I needed tickets. F*ck up #1, buying pit tickets. My first ever pit experience. Keep in mind, I was 5,4 and 125 pounds. Me and my best friend, who is accompanying me, decide to kick it up a notch. Which brings us to f*ck up #2. Paying my other friend to make us edibles for the concert. At this point in my life, neither me or my best friend had ever taken edibles, and he‚Äôd never even smoked.  Day of the concert, we do our thing. Friend only eats part of his, I down the entire brownie. We‚Äôre in the pit, Phil Anselmo and his band play. We don‚Äôt feel anything yet. We start thinking our friend played us. Next band comes out, I start to feel a lil ~weird.~ Then it hits me like a ton of bricks. (Any metal church fans out there?) y‚Äôall. When I say I kept disappearing and nodding back into reality, I mean it. I cried, kept fading in and out of reality. I had no idea weed could do this. By the time slayer comes out, I‚Äôm GONE. The intro starts, curtain drops, and that‚Äôs all I remember from the actual stage. I‚Äôm panicking, needing to get out. Me and my friend swim through the crowd, and I have no idea how long it took us to get out. We sat out most of the concert, as I could barely even think. The ride home was a blur. Matter of fact, the next few days were a blur. 
Upon further investigation, 2 grams of Captain America OG made into 2 brownies comes out to around 240 mg per brownie, if that gives any of you an idea. Ive learned my lesson. 

Tl;dr ate a 240mg brownie at a slayer concert, in the pit. Thought I was going to die.",2,3,tifu
t3_krij98,TIFU by sitting on a very fluffy blanket with my whole family while wearing a butt plug,"For Christmas, my boyfriend got me a butt plug (looks like [this](https://imgur.com/a/gKBiSR6) ). Tonight, I knew I was going to be left alone because it was a family movie night and I told them I wasn't feeling well. So, naturally, I went ahead and watched a youtube video about butt plugs and stuck it inside. I sent a couple of pictures to my boyfriend and while I was having a fun time, my dad knocked on the door and told me to come to join the family.

I didn't want to, but I hadn't been with them in a while. I study and live in a university halfway across the country and it was one of those rare occasions everyone (my 2 brothers and my mum and dad) were at home. And with the ""appreciating small things due to the pandemic"" mindset, I decided to go downstairs and watch a movie with them.

Our couch is really old, and we don't want people coming in and out the house fixing it with the pandemic, so we just had on this microfibre plush blanket on top of the couch. I sat in between my brothers and since the room was dark, I was 100% no one could tell I had a butt plug on. I mean, no one would be able to tell with the lights on anyway. I was immersed in the film (Singing in the Rain) and I sat very still and comfortably on one spot. The film ended, my parents to bed, and my brothers and I all stood up at the same time.

Now, you could see our butt imprints on the blankets, but you could also see a distinct mechanical non-human body part heart mark right on my butt imprint. Like it was perfectly outlined and white contrasted with the other part of the blanket. My brothers saw it because they were comparing their butt sizes on the imprints, and assumed for a second I sat on something. They started looking around to see what I was sitting on, then they realized it wasn't what I sat on, but what I had in me that was marked on the blanket.

No words were exchanged. One of them just went over, smoothed all the imprints and erased the butt marks on the blanket. They walked, silently, to their individual rooms. I am currently in my room and I feel like God did me wrong to expose me like that.

Well, it is what it is. Unlike my boyfriend who's laughing about it now, maybe I'll be able to laugh about it sometime in the future. For now, y'all can enjoy this story. It's my late Christmas gift to you all.

TLDR: Got a buttplug in, sat with my family, my buttplug made a very visible and obvious indentation on the blanket which my brothers all saw.",12189,595,tifu
t3_krig9d,TIFU using icy hot,"Okay, so my girlfriend got me some icy hot just yesterday for some shoulder pain I was having. Used it the other night and it worked well!

(Sidenote: I never really use over the counter medicine, like ever, which includes topical creams and such.) I was actually very impressed with how well it was helping my shoulder/neck area. Today was the day that icy hot would FU my day.

I did a lot of heavy lifting/walking so my knees started feeling kind of sore. Gf decided to rub on some icy hot (nice and thick too lol) all around my knees and at first you'd think ""Ooh nice cooling sensation. Ah, relaxing heat."" For me, it was more of a ""THIS F*CKING BURNS SO MUCH MORE THAN YESTERDAY."" So I kept trying to sleep and just could not stand the searing pain anymore. 

Turns out what I was experiencing was a chemical burn which apparently is kind of rare but can happen to some people. ü§ó

t3_kri6gd,Tifu (really like last year I fucked up and admitted it to my girlfriend today),"Little background to paint the picture.
24, used to have a pretty good job. (Pay wise) quit because I'd rather neck myself than torture myself for dollars.

Started trading stocks and turned a few hundo into over 60k. Legit. I felt like the fucking goat.

Girlfriend and I had a rough start but year 2 was going great

And that's really all the prologue needs.

Quit good job in December last year mainly to spend Christmas with the family and find another job, found one, worked legit 26 hours straight once. Fairly certain it's not legal but in long story if I didn't drive to Baltimore (6 hours each way) to get supplies for the shop, to make the food, and sell the food, we wouldn't be open at all that week because the manager was a fuck up and I saved her entire career. I got her fired too cause fuck her but that was later.
Started consuming recreational Marijuanas. Tried it but never stuck. Magically I went from 0 smoking to awoken and tokin' 24/7. Quit the store. Stonks doing good, gf laid off from covid, I thought I was Jordan Belfort junior up in this shit. Making hundreds a day sometimes, between the copious amount of pot, spending every day off with my girl and seeing those stonks I felt invincible and I started putting off bills because I could just float till next week so I can do whatever this week.

Lost all my potential stock gains in like 1.5 days.
Negative 4k on robinhood (long story)
Maxed cards.
Other personal debt.
Continue to hide it from everyone around me. And let it build up.

Opened the water bill today. 980$ I've put it off all year. On top of my other fuck ups and losing over 60k in potential gains. I really do feel like offing myself. I started crying in the bathroom tonight when I knew I cant pay our rent this month or really anything. I've got enough for food but if I buy food there's no money left. 


And now that it came crashing down and I lost it all it now means that instead of ""using the cash for rent for something else and using my money to pay the rent"" I officially am a person who spent all my friends money on drugs, all my girlfriends money on drugs, and I lost every dollar I had.

*But wait theres more*

I knew what I was doing. I watched the descent. I'm a very intelligent person. I'm great at stepping out and looking at myself. No one is harder on me than me. But this year I slipped. I've been so lucky, plus using my witts to hustle I've never struggled. Not in school, not at work. I mean fuck, honestly looking back I would've called myself a God.

And tonight I humbley admit, and would like to claim the throne as the world's biggest fuck up, and reddit biggest retard. And that includes all those r/wallastreetbets retards too. I declare myself king. 

Because I KNEW I was doing it. And told myself I'd be okay. As opposed to people who are ignorant. At least they genuinely didn't know better. They may be stupid but I my friends... am a different breed. 

I don't need any anti suicide posts. I 98.72% (made that shit up) won't neck myself. But if I do, I'll go out like a fucking king by slamming my car into a wall revbanging that bitch since the car is all I have left. As of now my girlfriend is staying but I've lied to her this entire journey. I didn't even tell her about the 60k in gains untill tonight because instead of cashing out I got greedy. And I knew it.

Tldr. Ya boi done fucked his life and im in enough debt to buy a small house at 24. And now I can't can't afford drugs to cope (let's be real I shouldn't. I know that, but at this point I'm stupid enough to throw my life away)

Yabadaba doo I'm out of here

Edit. I want to change the ending of my speech to 

**thanks for coming to my ted talk**

Edit number 2. Sometime the world tells you not to give in. I went for a drive to clear my head, pulled into wawa for gas and food and a kid rolls up to me and compliments my car (I got them cosmic purple wheels always catching looks) and I kinda jokingly told him how fucked I was since we had been shooting the shit by the gas pump for a few minutes and he told me I can work at dominos with him, he'll give me the job as long as the manager can waive my reckless (2.5 years ago) and you know, dominos might not be the best job to recover but it's a fuckin start.

t3_kri5wg,TIFU by taking home shells from the beach.,"This is ongoing from earlier.

Me (23F) and my fiance (31F) went to the beach earlier to kill time while waiting on some repairs for my car to get done. Was fun! Found a lot of shells, hermit crabs all over, dug up some clams and played with some pelicans!

There were 2 very pretty spiral shells that I loved and wanted to take home and use in a future Salt Water tank my fiance was planning. I made sure to check as well as I could that they were empty, rinsed the sand out, and stuck them in my pocket (for about 6 or 7 hours till we got home). 

When we did, I placed them next to the bathroom sink to wash more thoroughly later as I was feeling lazy at the moment. Mind you, these were pretty far from the edge, they wouldn't accidentally fall by themselves.From our room we suddenly heard the sound of something falling in the bathroom, and went to go check it. One of the shells were on the floor! Luckily it wasnt cracked and we just chalked it up to the cats being dumb, so I moved them higher on a cabinet.

About 45 minutes later, the same shell falls AGAIN. This time, there was 0 way a cat could have done it, so I checked the shell closer than I did before and found that it was inhabited! We made plans to go back tomorrow and release him and apologize for kidnapping lol

Well I went to check on something else while I left him on the counter by accident, and this time he must have fell on a pair of pants that was on the floor so we didn't hear him fall. We looked EVERYWHERE for him, and still haven't found him! My fiance is freaking out that theres a crab in the hotel room somewhere and that I'm an idiot for not watching or at least not putting him in the sink. 

I'm still looking for the SOB but I might make crab legs for dinner instead of realeasing him!

TL;DR: Went to the beach, picked up some shells,  then took 'em home. Found out one was  a home to a hermit crab, which is now missing somewhere in the hotel room. Sigh.",23,3,tifu

You may ask, well she previously told me that she was going to exercise, so I thought she was being silly with her belly after december, but boy was I wrong.

t3_krhrq3,TIFU by letting me act before I think.,"So the story is this, today school has started again, and it goes semi normal. Though one thing is I needed some new headphones for my laptop so I can focus in class, as my dog had bit on my previous ones. So me and my mom planned to go to target to get some after school. Though, unexpectedly to me at least, a good friend of hers had visited us and brought his son. I wanted to hang out with him, so I thought we would play COD Warzone. Thing is, I didn‚Äôt have Gold/Live. 

Also for context or anything, I am 18 years old, I live with my mom, and do not work, I have a debit card, in which I get money either through child support or something similar, though today I only had like....$4 in my account, yes seriously. Just know I‚Äôm a avid collector of transformers and have a lack of self control when it comes to them and the opportunities to buy them. This is important for later on. 

Anyways, back to the story, so instead of being honest and say...play a single player game. I go ahead and buy the 1 month membership for Gold, which is $10 I believe. Which puts me in the negatives/a overdraft fee already to around $-8. We play, the friend and his son soon leave and I tell my mom on the purchase and she says we have to go to the bank to deposit money for that overdraft fee. 

We do so, but we first go to target to get the small groceries my mom bought there via take out. She said I should take this opportunity to go inside and find some headphones. She gives me $40, and I had $40 in my wallet already, just note that this money was given to me by my Aunt to save for a gaming PC, she gave $100. It goes normally, most of the headphones seemed to have sold out cause it was late, but I find some for around...$15 I believe. But then...the plastic addiction took over(I consider me collecting transformers a plastic addiction). I go to the toy isle where the Transformers are and see some toys I was really interested in and wanted. I was thinking at first, but my impulsive took over and I got 3 figures. Each $19.99 each. In which I go to the self checkout, the cost was around $81.38. To lower it, I used the little money I had, $1.40, in the target mobile app. I do it, now the price was $79.90. I continue the checkout, getting ¬¢10 in change. I go back to the car and basically keep on thinking on my horrible decision. My mom gets upset initially, but she‚Äôs had a long day, so she stopped. We then went to a atm to get money out of her own account(we use different banks) and transferred it to my account. Which I still feel horrible for, as she is using her own money to correct my mistake. So yeah....thanks for reading and hope you all have a good week, and year even. 


TL;DR : Got myself into a overdraft fee with me knowing fully, went to target and had money that was to be used for only some headphones, use it to buy Transformers figures, mom had to take money from her account to transfer it to mine to fix the overdraft fee

t3_krhmmt,TIFU by accidentally texting my co-worker that he was going to be fired.. and celebrating it.,"This happened two years ago while working my first job out of college. I just recently thought about how fucking awful (hilarious) this was and wanted to share.

Myself along with about 5 friends from college all landed the same entry level sales role with a startup tech company in the Bay Area. We were all from the Midwest so working together at a start up in California was super cool. We had happy hours on the beach almost everyday; we were broke, post grads living on the west coast. 

We made some friends that were locals, and all around our age. Majority easy going, motivated young professionals trying to make a name for ourselves. Except for this damn new kid.

At about 8 months into the job, one of our friends, Johnny, made his way to a team lead position- so he was now essentially on the way to becoming a manager &amp; sort of helping out the new hires.

Shortly after securing his first promotion, team lead of about 30 entry level sales folks, our 45 year old manager was suddenly fired. 

This made way for the possibility of Johnny (24 year old), our good friend to become our direct manager.. Sort of awesome, and sort of very awkward.

After a couple weeks of our director being indecisive about whether to have Johnny be the manager of essentially his 30 friends.. the decision was final. Johnny is now our manager.

Back to this new kid - we‚Äôll call him Chad. Chad was born and raised in California, a bit different than the majority of our friends we had met that had moved in from out of state for the job. Chad loved to talk about his daddy‚Äôs money, Cars, numerous homes, and would leave work early (starting the first week of the job) to play golf. 

He found ways to cheat at work, constantly hit on the very few women at the company, took advantage of having a young friendly manager, and all around became pretty well hated amongst our team. 

Everyone wanted Chad fired. I was essentially begging Johnny to fire him as I couldn‚Äôt stand him, knew he didn‚Äôt need the money, and just all around didn‚Äôt think he deserved the job.

One morning (we had to get to work at 5:30am working east coast hours) Johnny pulls me into a room and tells me he got approval to let go of Chad. I was fucking ecstatic! I didn‚Äôt have to deal with this fucking guy any longer, he was going to be fired in a couple hours. Johnny made sure to tell me not to tell a soul and this was between us, he couldn‚Äôt hold it in and not tell me because he knew I‚Äôd be stoked.

I rushed back to my desk, went to text my co-worker the great news: I typed - ‚ÄúDude Chad is getting fired today hahaha thank fuck‚Äù 

I texted it to Chad.. he comes over to my desk, showing me my text message, on his phone, with watery eyes. I had no idea what to do, I nervously laughed and said ‚ÄúI mean it is what it is man, you wanna go talk it out?‚Äù 

He says ‚Äúno, Johnny we need to talk, with his voice quivering holding back tears‚Äù

They leave the room and I instantly feel awful, know that now my job and Johnny job are on the line.

Chad wasn‚Äôt fired because HR got involved and felt bad for him. I had numerous meetings with HR and my director. Chad left on his own, and got a better job a few months later. After MONTHS of awkwardly passing him in the hallway &amp; not speaking to anyone.

I was almost fired, along with Johnny for the way we handled the situation. That was Johnny first month as a manager. Johnny is still a a manger there today. I left a couple months later for a competitor. 

I still hate Chad but feel awful for how that went down. I also quadruple check who the recipient is that I am texting whenever I am talking shit. 

TL;DR: My friend was my manager and let me know he was going to fire this kid the whole company hated (Chad). When I got the news, I texted Chad accidentally and said ‚ÄúDude Chad is getting fired today hahaha thank fuck‚Äù and almost lost my job while he kept his",9,5,tifu
t3_krhbxb,TIFU by sending extremely passive aggressive messages to my sister after she left for college without saying bye.,"Ok so some context. This happened hours ago, my sister's Winter break is over so she went back to college today right? Well I helped her with her stuff and then said I was gonna use the bathroom, expecting to see her outside and say goodbye to her. My mom texts me saying she parked across the street and I go out only to see she isn't there.

So I get in the car and we wait. Turns out according to mom she came down and didn't come out. Mind you, she has a boyfriend who she obviously gives all her attention to (no joke she talks to him 24/7 but not to us) and up and left. Me, my mom, and my stepdad, we were all upset at her.

Later on, come nightfall it was dinner time and I got too pissed and messaged her an extremely passive aggressive message. I sent:

""Heyo (sister's name), just wanna let you know we're all upset that you didn't say bye to us and just ghosted us cuz of your boyfriend but y'know it's whatever! I hope your phone actually ""works"" this time with us and not just with your boyfriend!üòÉüòÑ""

Yeah, big mistake. She got ticked and I went back and forth saying ""Riiiight but I bet if it was (sister's boyfriend's name) you would've received it huh?"" (This was after I told her mom did call her and she ignored us... again.)

This lead to me sending a screenshot as evidence of the fact that mom DID call her saying ""Bullshit! You didn't call us but mom did!""

Side note, I'm 14, she is 21. I rarely curse to her (only when I quote some dumb meme or a thing my friend said). I have NEVER cursed at her in spite. Today was the first.

Of course, she got upset, and said not to curse at her (although, if I'm extremely upset at you and I feel it's appropriate obviously I'll curse. I won't give people respect if they do something like that. Especially if they're a family member).

She then claimed she was in her room thinking I'd come back (mom and I had a feeling she'd say that) and then I said ""Mom and I had a feeling you were gonna pull the ""I was in my room"" card.""

And things sorta went from there, with my last message to her being ""But ya know it iz what it izzz! Right?üòÉ""

Later on mom got a call from sis's boyfriend and sis was on the line. I overheard it all. She was crying and when mom put me on the phone to talk to her sis said (without me knowing I was on the line) in her tearful voice: ""I don't want to talk to her right now.""

**That hurt. Really badly. I somehow made my 21 year old sister cry. And I felt so terrible. I still do. I couldn't eat the rest of my dinner.**

And here I am! 12:33 AM and typing away all of this and fuck I feel terrible. She's gonna call this weekend supposedly but eh I dunno.

TLDR: My sister went back to college without saying goodbye and I ended up coming at her through texts and making her cry because I was so passive aggressive.",9,42,tifu
t3_krh86d,TIFU by swan diving into my roommate‚Äôs head.,"For once this actually did happen today. A little over 2 hours ago, I was playing some pickup basketball with my roommate. Full disclosure, we are both super competitive and so it‚Äôs no surprise that we both desperately wanted to win this meaningless game of pickup at the gym. 

With 2 points to go for the win and my roommate down by 1, he was pushing hard to try to get a basket to tie it up. Unfortunately for him, his dribbling was getting really sloppy and I was able to bat the ball away from him. As it bounced away, we both wanted to get the ball and dove for it. He got there first. 

Crack! I get there a tenth of a second after he does, but instead of getting the ball, I ended up diving eye-first into the crown of his head. Immediately I felt some intense pain radiate from below my eyebrow and when I opened my eye I could already see a lump forming and starting to cover my eye. Despite my competitive nature, I was willing to cede the rest of the game so I could get some ice on the golf ball that was quickly growing over my eye. After 20 minutes, my eye looked like [this. ](https://imgur.com/a/A96GCxS)

I held out some small measure of hope that my eye would get better as I iced it, but the lump quickly went from golf ball sized to baseball sized and now my eye looks like [this.](https://imgur.com/a/zO2sq53)

t3_krgx0m,TIFU By accidentally taking my spouse to one of those unexpected pregnancy pro-life clinics,"This happened a little over about a year ago. In December 2019 my(29m) common-law spouse(28f) and I found out we were having a baby. We had a girl! We love her dearly and she's really the best thing to happen to us. At the time however, the pregnancy was unexpected, unplanned and what Bob Ross might call a ""happy accident"".

We may not have known a single thing about having a baby, but we had our google toolbelts on and started doing some deep dives into what we need to do next. We didn't have a family doctor, didn't even know what Midwives do, couldn't tell family or friends just yet, but we wanted to make sure we do all the right things in this pregnancy. I googled something like ""unexpected pregnancy help near me"" and one of the top results seemed like a nice place, the reviews were great, the website looked great, it seemed to be what we needed - somewhere to get all the advice we need to kick off this 9-month and lifelong journey.

I called the place and the receptionist was polite and warm so I told her the situation ""we're expecting a child and we don't know what to do, we need some guidance"". In hindsight, I never gave them a chance with that statement. They booked us in for that evening, made sure to let us know they are a charitable organization not for profit so there won't be any fees. FANTASTIC!

So we showed up to the appointment that night and although the place looked kinda like a Sunday school, things seemed fine. No waiting, they saw us right away. This is great. My partner was also rather thrilled about the atmosphere and the people, plus we got free apple juice boxes. Nice!

So we met with a councillor and she had us both fill out a form, pretty basic stuff, age, sex(yes please), married/not married, basic medical history, pretty normal stuff it seemed. So we each signed and handed the form back. The councillor then told us we forgot to fill out the back page. These were the real questions, how many sexual partners do you have, do you have any STDs, have you ever had an abortion, have you decided if you wanted to keep it? Wait, what??

OK so yeah if nothing else tipped us off, surely that did... Right? Nope, we finished the form and handed it right back. This councillor didn't even read it and started showing us some things.... We got to see lifesize models of how the fetus should look right now (except that they were just fully developed babies shrunken down to various sizes), we heard some Bible verses and some interpretations of them, then the fun stuff. They showed us real photos of abortions, like high resolution images of actual abortions that belong in medical journals. Neither of us were prepared for this and my spouse nearly lost her stomach. We kinda just tried not to look fazed and we thanked the councillor for the presentation, she was sure to give us a phone number for a support line, some contact information for doctors and Midwives nearby and some church pamphlets that looked so full of Kool-aid I wanted another juice box. It was a weird experience.. At least we got a referral to a doctor and a midwife. 

That's pretty much it, I hadn't planned to post this, or for it to be this long, but now we are able have a good laugh about our own stupidity (mostly mine) and thought it made an interesting read.

tl;dr
Was surprised with a pregnancy for Christmas in 2019, googled unexpected pregnancy looking for guidance on where to begin, ended up going to a Christian anti-abortion clinic by accident.

In my country most people drive a manual, and therefore you have to pull on a handbrake after you park.

As usual I held the handbrake and yanked it up, only this time, instead of the handbrake, it was just my hand which went up, with enough force to make my phone slip out of the hand, jump a couple of feet into the air, and land directly on my balls.
The phone weighed 200 grams, so it pains. A lot.

Tl;dr: Don't try to pull on the handbrake whole holding your phone if you don't want your phone to bungee jump and kiss your balls.",167,22,tifu
t3_kqwjpk,TIFU by oversleeping for over an hour and missing something important," For a bit of back story, my son and I are disabled and my partner works 6am-4pm Monday to Friday. I can't drive so we're a little restricted with what we can do. For years now we've had our groceries delivered and, due to Covid, not only is this more important delivery slots fill up fast. I usually order for delivery on Monday between 9am and 10am.

So recently, I've been oversleeping in the morning as I'm not sleeping well. I usually subconsciously remember on a Monday but today I slept right through the delivery. The problem is, there is no way I can get it delivered another day so I have a choice, even make my partner do it, which he will never let me forget (and is harsh), or drag my boy out tomorrow and get a taxi to the nearest store (over 3 miles away) or starve for 2 weeks. Tomorrow's going to be tough but I'm just wondering how much my partner is going to rant and rave when he gets home tonight. 

Totally my fault, did not need this and I feel so bad! However I blame the pandemic for there being no slots this week I can rearrange it for.

Edit: I manage to arrange to have it come later but not only is my partner mad at me for missing it in the first place, I forgot to get cheese. Apparently, me suggesting he pick some up on the way home from work is unreasonable after he's been up for twelve hours. Well excuse me.

 

TL;DR I missed the delivery of groceries this morning and there are no slots for two weeks. My partner is going to blow his top!",4,5,tifu
t3_kr2vzn,Tifu by showing my balls to a girl on omegle,"So this happened today in the evening . I was just using Omegle for some kind of timepass but eventually I forgot about it . It was just swapped out from my mind that I was using Omegle , that too on video call . They were going from one girl to another and I was lying naked on my bed just relaxing for a bit(I still forgot that Omegle webcam was on) . But then , after just a few seconds , I just looked downwards and what the fuckk !!!! There was an African girl who was texting me hi and hello and on my webcam I could see my balls and dick in low angle view . She was just laughing (yes seriously...!!!). But after seeing that , my throat went sore , my heartbeat gone crazy , my brain felt ice cold and I was really fucked up for some few seconds or so. But out of that tension and perplexed mood I quickly turned the cam of . It was really good that I had long hair so my face was half covered and she was unable to see me . But I really felt very bad and sorry for her , as she maybe wanted to chat but I ended up showing her my balls . FML .

TL DR : was unaware of Omegle webcam turned on while I was naked on my bed and ended up showing my balls and dick to a girl . But thankfully , she was unable to see my face cuz of my long hair jumped forward while I was closing the cam üòÇ .",0,2,tifu
t3_krgivq,TIFU picking a stupid fight,"
So hi, this is my first post, sorry if I‚Äôm doing it wrong. Lol. 
So on New Years Day I had my friend over, we will call him Blue Cheese. Anyway, this is my best friend, one of two friends (but also I‚Äôm kind of in love with him because of another TIFU, it‚Äôs super lame). Well, we got in a fight, and I ended up telling Blue Cheese I didn‚Äôt want to be friends anymore and to get his stuff out of my house. And then he did. And I was really broken up about it. I guess I expected him to console me even though he was also upset and ignore my childishness? 

Then I fucked up some more and sent long ass texts pouring my heart out to him to receive nothing in return. 

On some level I expect him to feel things for me because I feel things for him which is not fair

But on the other hand we used to hang out almost every day and he was really important in my life. And i didn‚Äôt think it would be that easy for him to lose me. I mean I have witnessed this guy get harassed and threatened by one of his drunk friends and still reach out to them the next day. It‚Äôs hard knowing we are not the friends I thought we were. 

Also I broke my phone.

And then on top of everything when I sent my message to end all messages my phone went out and now I got the new phone and he probably never responded but now I‚Äôll never know for sure. But TIFU is one of his favorite subreddits so maybe he will see this and reach out? 

TL:DR, I was being petty and immature and I lost my best friend. I just want my Blue Cheese back.",6,1,tifu
t3_kr6fum,TIFU by having my car break down 120 miles away from home,"Obligatory, this didn't happen today. This happened two years ago on mothers day sunday. Long story because I fucked up a lot on the way to the ending. 

My parents planned a trip to Viet Nam just because, and needed me to drive them to the LAX. Okay no problem. I argued that we should take my new prius c its more fuel efficient, but my father said that our older prius had a larger trunk that could fit their luggage better. Also my prius c could totally fit all their luggage, but they wanted my little sister to tag along on the ride up so I couldn't put the seats down. So like okay whatever, we'll take the old prius. My dad drives us up to LA all slow and responsibly like an asian father does, he hands me the keys at the airport so I can drive me and my sister back to San Diego. 

I (25 ftm) drive like a total douchbag on account of my toxic masculinity stemming from being trans. I ruined my last car from driving it too fast and ruining the transmission. I didn't learn my lesson then. I take the prius and we take the ramp to get onto the freeway. I do this stupid thing where I accelerate really hard down the exit so I can match freeway speeds by the time I get to the freeway. This aint no sports car, immediately I felt something... slip? it was strange, it was like something in the car slipped and suddenly the prius starts beeping and screaming at me to pull over and it wont accelerate anymore. I thought it was just doing some dumb old car thing, so I tried gassing it a little more and more. No help, I went from 55 to 15 really fast. I pull off in the next exit which was an exit to essentially the middle of nowhere. It looked to be some truck stations and factories and not a SOUL anywhere. My car barely manages to slide into a little neighborhood. I turn off the car and attempt to turn it back on. Car was whole ass dead. 

I was like, alright stay calm, call your dad. Oh wait, I just dropped him off at the airport and is likely in an airplane on his way to ASIA. So I start to slightly panic, but I can't panic because my sister is with me and I'm her role model and I must maintain super cool. I start phoning my friends and looking online of what to do and how to fix this. My phone is starting to die. I can't charge it in my car because it's dead. I decide the only thing I can do is call a tow. I shop around online trying to find the cheapest tow from LA to San Diego. My friend calls me saying that he talked to someone who was willing to drive up to LA to tow me back down to San Diego for 500 bucks. That sounds like a lot, so I said cool I'll think about it. I continue shopping around on the internet to find cheaper alternatives. I figured maybe I could call a tow company and try to see if they can help me for something cheaper than 500. At this point I'm full on panicked because it was hot as hell, my sister was hungry, my phone was dying and the same creep walked by my sister an I for like the 8th time. 

The woman on the phone told me to calm down and that she could send me a tow for $620 and in my panic, I agreed. She proceeds to tell me that there is a $200 fee for cancellation once my car is on the bed of the truck. And I was like yeah yeah yeah. Anyway, dude shows up, has a really bad attitude, takes his time putting my car on his flatbed tow. My sister and I hop into his truck and he's on the phone with the tow company. My phone rings and it's from the tow company, a different woman was talking to me and tells me that i was way under quoted for the job and that it would actually be $875 and I said NO WAY! And she reminds me that my car is already on the bed and that cancellation would be $200. I was furious that they would only tell me that the job would be significantly more expensive AFTER my car was already on the bed. But I didn't have time to argue because my phone was going to die any second. I tell her that I just don't have that much money, I only had $750 in the bank. She very reluctantly agrees. So I get towed back to San Diego for $750 because I panicked and forgot that my friend had found someone willing to do it for 500. 

Finally got home and had an anxiety attack in the safety of my shower but at least I was home. The old prius is still sitting dead in our driveway to this day. We've taken it to many a repair shop but it just keeps dying. Also, I really did only have $750 in my bank account, so I had to buy things using my credit card (i live paycheck to paycheck) until I got paid again and I'm STILL in debt (I also have student and auto loans). Every time I see the old prius (or any silver prius for that matter) I involuntarily break out in sweats and get really light headed. I was told I developed some form of diet PTSD from my experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I drove my prius too fast in Los Angeles and killed it. I panicked and grotesquely overpaid for a tow back to san diego which costed me 750 bucks which is my entire bank account and so now I'm in debt and triggered by silver priuses.",3,3,tifu
t3_kr9g2q,TIFU by giving myself a chemical burn in my throat.,"Today I (55m) completely nuked my throat. I'm a fairly adventurous guy, I like hot foods and I don't shy away from eating them. A co-worker makes his own ""nut rub"" as he calls it which is ground peppers. Reapers, habaneros and ghost peppers. He uses this to add heat to all sorts of things. The star of my FU was jerky with reaper and ghost pepper dust liberally applied. It was hot. Nose running, eyes watering hot. That was okay, about 15 minutes later I was able to cope with things. The actual F to the U was later, about 3 hours after eating the jerky. I have a toothache. I use this liquid toothache medicine which is clove oil that you apply to a cotton ball (mini cotton ball) and then pack the cavity. I got my cotton ball loaded, put it into the affected molar and as soon as the oil mixed with my saliva and slid down my throat I was hit with a blinding pain. I couldn't breathe. My throat seized and refused to swallow. My tongue felt like it grew to 4 times its size and I began to salivate copiously. My nose started running, my eyes started watering and my throat was fucking aflame. This lasted about 4 lifetimes. Every second was agony. I was choking, gagging and coughing because the onrush of saliva was trying to go down my windpipe. The whole ordeal lasted a solid 5 minutes before I was finally able to work my tongue loose, swallow the torrent of spit going down my throat and stagger over to my lunch pail  and get a slug of water. It didn't help much. I finally gave up and left work early so I could get some oral anesthetic spray and went home. I'm currently sitting at my computer and contemplating my life choices while occasionally shooting the spray down my throat. Learn from my example and don't mix insanely hot foods with clove oil. Nothing good will come of it.

TL;DR Ate super hot beef jerky and later used clove oil toothache medicine, gave the back of my throat a pretty painful chemical burn.",7,0,tifu
t3_kra7bq,TIFU by tearing part of the roof off the company truck,"This happened earlier today. I work for a company that uses box trucks for service. Before I go any further, let me preface this by stating that I don't have much experience driving anything larger than a pickup truck and my company knew this when I got hired.

Moving on, while going to unload the truck before moving to our next location on the property, in order to reach the dumpster you have to go under a large tree with a large portion of the trunk hanging over. Thinking I had the clearance and was already past the point needed to make the turn clearly, I turned the truck, but ended up wedging the truck under the hanging part of the trunk. We were able to get it out, but now the truck had a large portion of the roof missing.

Now I sit in anticipation for tomorrow morning to see if I still have a job.

t3_krba1h,TIFU by drinking 25 hours worth of 5 hour energy.,"I literally could not stay still while typing this so excuse some spelling mistakes if any.

So today I went over to a mall with my friends so we could do some random bullshit later with stuff we bought. We went in one of my friends van so we could all fit comfortably. (Not the most fit group)

So we all got in and about ten minutes into the ride one of us decided to back flip into the trunk. (No dash in-between so back seats can be folded) He hit his head on something, we ask what it is and he decides to throw it up to us. It hit the car roof and landed straight on my head.

Well as it turns out my friend who owns the van is a hoarder and has this big pack of many bottles of 5 hour energy.

After a little while we got bored and were thinking of ways to make this more fun for us. (We all live in a rual area far away from any mall.) And long story short I ended up drinking quite a bit of the 5 hour energy stuff. 25 hours worth. This is when I decided anymore could be seriously harmful since I wasn't getting any effects.

We eventually got to the mall and I didn't get any rush effects. After checking out a store or two we head to the food court and got some Chick-fil-A since we wanted some of those spicy chicken sandwiches. And this is when I found out why the 5 hour energy didn't work.

As it turns out, you need food in your stomach for the shit to work. I took about two bites before I asended to levels of energy so extremely high. I nearly had a panic attack if it wasn't for my need to move. I ran around the store so much we all got kicked out. 

We were all in so much amazement that we forgot where the car was, and so I didn't hesitate to run around the entire parking lot once or twice before I found it. I couldn't ride in the car for a while because of how energetic I was and instead ran. The car wasn't going the fast and there was a lot of places they had to stop so I easily caught up.

By the point I go back in the car we were out of town. I had wanted to get back in a while ago, but I could not sit down. I could only get in because I sprained my ankle. And this whole time I felt like I've been overclocked to such an extreme I couldn't think because I kept interrupting myself.

There's some people that walk down my road in the morning and afternoon to keep people from speeding while are in cars more. They almost called an ambulance thinking my immediate health was a time bomb and I was gonna run out. 


TL;DR - Found out how to get 5 hour energy to work and couldn't function for some hours. Almost got put in ER.",6,1,tifu
t3_krepj9,TIFU by Downloading Minecraft Mods on My Chromebook,"So I'm a gamer. A budget gamer. My parents aren't poor by any means, we are actually pretty well off, but we have to be frugal. If I want a sixty-dollar videogame, I have to buy it myself. Since I don't have a job, obviously I can't get a six-thousand dollar gaming PC, I have to rely on either christmas gifts, hand-me-downs, or birthday presents. My mom is a doctor, and regularly buys electronics for her practice. Once in a while, she will bring home a crappy PC or some other old electronic that she bought an upgrade for. This is how I got my eight-year-old Ipad pro that I like to draw on.

One day, my mom brought home an old PC. I used this chance to finally get Minecraft Java (I had only played Minecraft on my phone.) The PC was s\*\*\*, so it was VERY slow, and little kid me quickly infested the poor thing with adware, and a horrible virus that sent me nudes of random women. (Don't worry I'm a girl.)

Fast forwards a few years, and I was going to a new school. A new school that made laptops mandatory for schoolwork. I was excited, because it would be the first time I would get my own personal private computar.

When we were at Best Buy, I looked at all the cool computers that ran mostly Windows. But my parents wanted me to get a Chromebook. Back then, I knew nothing about Chromebooks, so I didn't know the thing we had just bought for $300 dollars was a total piece of s\*\*\*.

I got home and logged into all my accounts. I wanted to play something on Steam, so I tried to get one of the free games. I was unsuccessful. You can't get games on Chromebooks unless you do some complex stuff on Linux, an extension that comes with every Chromebook.

A few months later, and I was fed up. I looked through YouTube for ways to get games on a Chromebook. Specifically Minecraft. To my delight, there were a couple people talking about the subject, and I chose the video with the most views. I ran Linux, put in all the commands needed, and I was legitimately surprised when the Minecraft launcher worked, and I was directed to Minecraft's title screen. No issue.

For the next few months, I happily played Minecraft. I built a cool amusement park, and was starting a massive minecraft city I had in my head. I also had a survival world, but I didn't play it often, because the game would crash regularly, and I had to go to the setting to set a bunch of things to the lowest setting. Like the graphics and render distance. I think it was because since all of my creative worlds were on superflat, those had an easier time loading chunks in.

I was soon unsatisfied. I should have stayed unsatisfied. I wanted mods on my minecraft worlds. BAD F\*\*\*\*\*\* IDEA. The same guy I had learned to download minecraft from had posted another video about how to download mods on a Chromebook. I followed all the steps like last time, and it worked. I spent hours downloading mods and trying them out. I even created a survival world full of mods. Remember what I said about survival worlds? I tested out all the inventory pets from the inventory pet mod, and I checked out new biomes from the biomes o plenty mod.

Problems started to appear, but I ignored the warning signs. The game would crash way more, and there was this bug where I sometimes couldn't press the buttons on the title screen. When I finally acknowledged that something was wrong, it was when I had downloaded a certain mod that caused there to be an error screen every time I tried to launch Minecraft, and it would crash soon after that.

I shrugged and went to bed. Hoping that my Chromebook had just overheated, and things would be solved the next day. Nope. When I clicked on the Minecraft launcher, a different error came up saying something like Linux apps can't open. I panicked and looked up on Google the specific error, but nothing came up. I waited another day, but the same error screen. Not only could I not launch the Forge launcher, but I couldn't play my vanilla worlds either.

So that meant all my hard work on all of the minecraft worlds I had on my Chromebook was all down the drain. I wish I could have backed up my worlds, but you can't do that on a Chromebook. My world files are in my Linux files, and that won't open either. So it really was too good to be true. You can't play games on Chromebooks, and really shouldn't try. I guess Icarus really did fly too close to the sun.

TL:DR- I downloaded Minecraft mods to my Chromebook that crashed the system and made Minecraft literally unplayable.",6,3,tifu

t3_kreoye,TIFU by not being thorough enough,"I guess this starts a while back, but the fuck-up happened today.  I bought a second hand xbox 360 for the purposes of playing Guitar Hero on back in 2015.  Didn't know at the time, but I bought a system that has some issues with guitar hero (the only game I really have ever played on it).

[There was a thread a while back in r/guitarhero that I'd seen detailing the issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/GuitarHero/comments/imkmxb/psa_if_you_play_on_xbox_make_sure_you_have_the/) and I'd heard it mentioned once or twice on the scorehero forums.  Basically, in August 2011, microsoft decided to change the sound card in their Xbox 360 slims, which the guitar hero games developed by Activision and Neversoft didn't like (the harmonix guitar hero game and even rock bands work fine).  What happens is the audio starts to desync from the game, making it harder to keep your timing right, and makes the notes seem ""random"".

Anyway, today I decided I was going to finally buy one that would work with guitar hero (as it's still the only game I play really.  That and rock band).  So I called my nearby stores asking if they had any 360s in.  Only one store did, and they had 2 original 360s (which are guaranteed to work, and both had HDMI output, which is a plus), a slim (which the power adapter was rated for the same model I had already that has the issue), and an E (which I had thought was just a model of the slim before heading off to the store).  The guy working there said I could come by and test the consoles out and see if they'd work.  I had my preferences that I'd rather not get an older one that's just going to crap out on me (I don't want to deal with a RROD), so I tried out the E first.

Additionally, I brought my own copy of Guitar Hero 5 to test (as it has issues on my slim, has all the songs unlocked from the start, and has relatively long songs).  This was the only game I brought in to test as i figured its the same issue on all the games.  This was what led to my fuck-up.

Game played fine, I chose 21st Century Schizoid Man because it's one of the longer songs on the game, which would let me amplify the issue if it's there.  It's also a song that has stuff at the end of the song that would be an indicator if it's having the issue.

Song works fine no issues.  So being that a newer model is my preference, I stop testing right there and buy the console.  It was also priced near the price of the original, although slightly more ($109 vs $100).  I did however get a lower price because I didn't want a controller included.

I got home and spent most of my day transferring my data over to the new 360 (I was using a thumb drive.  This was really annoying).

Finally (about an hour ago maybe?), I booted up Guitar Hero Metalica to play Master of Puppets.  The issue happened :/

Booted up Guitar Hero 5 to see if it was also having issues, played the same song I played in the store and it worked fine still.

Looks like if I brought more games (or at least guitar hero metallica), I could have bought a system that would work for me.  Instead I'm stuck with two xbox 360s that don't do what I want, and even less money than I had before :/

TL;DR tried to buy an xbox that works well with guitar hero games.  Was allowed to test the consoles, but picked a game to test that apparently works on one of the models that doesn't work well with the other guitar hero games.",2,1,tifu

We chilled for a little bit and then we went in my room and had sex. After she left, I looked around my bed in case any article of clothing was left behind. My parents are super religious and would not be okay with me casually banging some chick and I really didn't need them getting in my business. I didn't see anything and thought I was in the clear

I thought ""*no way in* ***fuck.****""* How could I have missed these? Thankfully my parents hadn't come home yet, only my sister did. But she never comes in my room so I thought ""*that was close.""* I picked up the panties and decided to give  them a few sniffs because I had never sniffed any before lol. Just then, my sister walked in the room and screamed to the top of her lungs. I told her to keep it down and she snatched them from my hands. She asked me why the fuck I was sniffing her underwear.  I was really embarrassed and told her I thought they were someone else's. My sister never met this girl before and didn't believe me at first so I promised to show her some dirty snaps we sent each other if she promised not to tell my parents. Then I asked her what the fuck her panties were doing in my room. Apparently she was doing her laundry earlier and came in my room with the laundry basket in her arms to ask me something.

The person that sent the invite referred to the person as her. Now, I didn't know that the person was a her, so I typed ""Her?"" And the entire discord chat suddenly went silent. I asked why they went silent, and then they asked me to check the person's reddit profile. I checked.... and they had a transgender flag pfp, and the pfp said ""I'm trans so that's cool."" I realize I fucked up and some other guy jokingly said that he can't tell my mother from a cow so it was alright.

Now, at this point, the mood was much lighter, but then I decide to fuck up again. I say to the chat ""My mom died a few months ago"". She didn't, but it was meant to be a dark joke. Then some other guy said same, and I assumed he was joking.

He then asked me ""What month?"" and I made up a fake month, and then he replied with an actual disease and date. That's when I realize: I fucked up badly.

For a few minutes the discord chat says that they are sorry for his and my loss. I say after it was actually a joke, and thankfully, things have cleared up.

TLDR: Asked if someone was a her when they were transgender, make a dark joke about how my mom was dead and learn that someone's mom actually died a few months ago.",1,4,tifu
t3_kreas0,TIFU By Cumming On My Cat,"So for context. I was sitting in my room about over a month ago. I had buildup of stress n shit and had to bust a nut. So me being the horny teen I am, I load some nice content and start wacking. At this point my cat had just came into my room to lay down. He is sitting over across the room about 3 to 4 1/2 ft away. Something about today was just stressful. I had just finished a 3week no fap period. 

So here I am willy in hand and I'm edging. So come about a good 6 munites later, I'm already ready to blow. So this would be my 4th organism and I go to stop the nerve signal to my willy to make it shoot cream. Except this time I'm too weak. I only managed to block off the flow. So here I am now shaking and right when I let off the point of pressure. I shot like a fucking rocket spewing thick heavy strings of cum


And I fall backwards due to the amount of release and intensity of this. I remember laying up to see I had hit my wall that was 5 ft away and looked down to see my cat had been in the line of fire... So I had to clean everything and the cat. The worst part wasn't cumming on him. It was having to give him a fucking bath and getting clawed the crap outta. 


But that was my fuckup I was too embarrassed to share. So I am now.

TL/DR 
I finished 3 weeks of no fap and needed to bust. I wasn't able to move my cat out of the line of the fire and had to suffer the responsibility of bathing him",18,20,tifu
t3_kre4i4,TIFU by not checking my hot sauce,"This happened an hour or so ago.

My husband and I recently started enjoy Pho. We've only made instant stuff at home. Once that ran out, I looked up some recipes and noticed we already had many of the ingredients, so after picking up some rice noodles, I headed home to cook faux-pho for dinner.

I get the broth going, adding onion, ginger, etc. Its time to add the hot sauce. I pull the bottle of Sriracha, twist open the cap, and give it a light squeeze.

Plop went the cap along with about a fifth of the bottle of the spiciest sauce I feel comfortable eating. Im not making a whole lot of soup, mind you. Just enough for about one ladle of broth each for my husband and I.

I dilute it a bit with water. Doesn't help. I add some more. Not helping. I've now made twice as much broth as I was intending and its still more spice than flavor. I can't dilute it more because I don't have enough onion and garlic to make up for the flavor.

""Fuck it, we can tolerate it."" - some of the whitest, blandest people you will ever meet. 

We get a few bites in and start crying from pain. I go to wipe my tears away. That's how I found out I had not washed the sauce off my hands properly.

So now my eyes hurt, our mouths hurt, and in the morning our buttholes are going to hurt, and not in the fun way.

I woke up this morning feeling fine but on a very uncomfortable bed. When I looked around I realized I was in a jail cell. I was super confused and then my roommate woke up and asked me to stop snoring. I was completely confused and just sat there trying to work through my memories. Last thing I remembered was taking an ambien and playing on my phone in bed. I rolled every possible scenario through my mind but couldn't remember shit after that last memory.  

Eventually a gaurd let all of us out for breakfast and I asked him why I was there, but he only knew that I was arrested for public intoxication. I didn't remember drinking so that only added to the confusion.  

I was eventually released and my dad was already waiting to pick me up. He informed me I had been acting very strange and had taken me to the hospital. After going through the ambien it was realized I had taken a dozen more later in a haze. The hospital apparently let me walk out on my own and after I tried to enter moving cars they called the police who arrested me for public intoxication. I'm so fucking embarrassed.  Could have been worse probably, though.

t3_krcual,TIFU by almost getting my self and my friend killed and my dad arrested for murder,"(TLDR at the bottom) This didn‚Äôt happens today but I‚Äôm still gonna tell the story;

so when my buddy Lucas (not his real name)and i where around 17-18 we where really into hunting rabbits, at first we hunted with air rifles because I live in a farm which is 20 meters from town and people used to call the cops every time we used a shotgun, but we weren‚Äôt catching anything cause pellets aren‚Äôt good for hunting (we where broke and hunting with a 200‚Ç¨ rifle and 2‚Ç¨ pellets). 

        We started making traps and in fact they worked great, the thing is that my family has a dairy farm with around 100 cows (at the time), so every bad smell was attributed to us even though they came from the water treatment facility and the local pig slaughterhouse or every person who also has animals here, but people always said it was us even though we have all the permits and a ‚Äúpoop management system‚Äù.
basically if you stand 100 meters in front of the barn you won‚Äôt smell anything.
We‚Äôve invited the local authorities and sanitary services to our farm to prove the smell wasn‚Äôt from our farm and they all seem to say that‚Äôs it‚Äôs nothing wrong with us and that neighbors are just assholes.
All of ur neighbors live at least 300 meters away from us, and the nearest house is 500 meters away from the barn so there‚Äôs no way they get any hint of smell from us.

One day things changed, there‚Äôs always been legends about us, the most of them where about my grandpa who was a ww2 German soldier who moved and became the first forestal engineer in my country, when he retired he built his farm.

There where many legends about my grandpa like that he had a contract with the devil because everything that he planted grew (it was because he used fertilizer) or that we had a snake hatchery and that we fed them with calves, that his dogs where a gift of the devil himself etc...

A day like any other my dad received a letter that said that the neighbors of saruca (the street next to our farm) where suing us and and the cause was: (it actually said this)  ‚Äúthey kill old cows and calves to feed their snakes‚Äù, my dad was livid, he couldn‚Äôt believe how stupid this was, at first he thought it was some kind of joke so he called the town hall to verify that this was legit and it was.

Some rumors started spreading and people started trespassing to search for proof of our ungodly behavior (obviously they didn‚Äôt find anything) so they placed cow and calf bones and killed pigs on our land to make it look like it was true (we don‚Äôt even have pigs) and when they couldn‚Äôt prove anything people decided to start threatening us, because of this my dad had to shoot a few people who trespassed (he made special shotgun cartridges with sea salt so it‚Äôs not lethal but it sure burns like hell and leave a easily recognizable mark on the skin) 

One day I was talking to my dad and he told me how much of a pest rabbits are and that I should hunt them, sooo....I did,  I called Lucas and told him what I wanted to do and before I could ask him he said yes.
The thing is that I forgot to tell my dad what we where about to do, Biiiiiiig  mistake, so at 8-9pm we started setting up our traps and we knew we needed to be quick to check them, otherwise stray and our neighbors dogs might get them first, so Lucas stayed at the farm and around 5:30 we took my truck and went to check the traps.

The milkman, who arrives at that time saw a truck wandering the farm and called my dad, he took one of his shotguns and went to check the wandering truck, we were checking the traps we left on the forest and suddenly I notice him because of the rear lights of his truck and called him;

Me: hey dad what are you doing here ? 
 
Dad: what ? Is that you ? WHAT THE FUCK ATE YOU DOING HERE  !?!?!?!?

Me: we are hunting rabbits like you told me 

Dad: ARE YOU NUTSS!?!?!? WHY DIDN‚ÄôT YOU TOLD ME !?!?!? IF YOU HADN‚Äôt CALLED ME I WOUL HAVE SHOT YOU TWO 

Dad: Jesus Christ..., go home AND NEVER PULL SOMETHING LIKE THIS AGAIN, YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME WHAT YOU WHERE DOING !!!!!!

So we went home and I knew I screwed up and that we could have been shot with those salt cartridges, the think is that later That day out of curiosity I checked his shotgun to see how salt cartridges where and I found out that he wasn‚Äôt carrying the non lethal ones, they were real cartridges , that‚Äôs when I realized that if I hadn‚Äôt called him we would probably be dead and my dad in jail for murder

t3_krc4zq,TIFU by eating raw potato,"Okay, please don't judge my IQ based on this! Also: happened some years ago, then eventually caught up with me.

When I was a kid I tried out for a basketball team. I wasn't a tall kid, so I asked the coach if there was anything I could do to get taller and he told me that he used to eat raw potato everyday until he reached the hight he was comfortable with.

Since I was 9 years old I totally trusted him, so I started to eat a piece of raw potato everyday to get taller. It tasted really nasty, but I was determined to grow tall and maybe one day become one of the best basketball players in the world.

Some months goes by, and I lost all interest in basketball, so I stop eating the raw potato. For some reason my parents were in this with me, so we were measuring my growth every week, and since I was only 9, I did grow a lot taller when eating the raw potato.

At some point I just stopped eating raw potato, and I totally forgot about all of this.

Fast forward to Christmas Eve 2020 I am now 27 years old and celebrating Christmas with my SO, my soon-to-be in laws and my family. We start talking about their height, since my SO and his brothers are all 1.90m (6'3) tall or taller. For some reason I said ""haha, you guys must have eaten A LOT of raw potato as kids!"" and my mom just burst out laughing and is almost choking on her food.

December 24th 2020, at 27 years old, I learned that raw potato does not make you tall.

TL;DR: I believed raw potato would make me tall, but it didn‚Äôt, and I was today years old when I found out. Not my proudest moment.

Edit: Changed some misspelled words. Wow, I just wrote this because I couldn‚Äôt sleep and didn‚Äôt think it would get this much attention! Thanks for all the comments and awards, I will try to reply to as many as I can!

Side note: I googled that raw potato is in fact not good for you in big amounts, but I never ate a whole entire potato in one go. I just grabbed small pieces, so I didn‚Äôt get sick.",23309,1024,tifu
t3_krbrjh,TIFU By Not Washing My Protein Shaker,"This is not a humblebrag, I am not a ripped and strong gift from the gods above that they have put on this earth for the purpose of being ogled at. This short cautionary tale will elaborate on why I am quite the opposite. 

First lockdown happened, (coming up to a year ago soon, wow) and I decided to get fit. Being a fitness noob I had to buy all the sporty do-dahs and whatamacallits and was ready to go. Had my protein shaker with me for the first home session and that double chocolate protein mix tasted sublime. Then during my second session, the next day, something must have distracted me because I didn't finish that session and that in turn was my very last session. And here lies the crux to the FU, that protein shake I had prepared for session 1.5 was never drank.

I forgot about it for the most part but whenever I did see that half full protein shake sitting on my bedroom locker, it was if it was mocking me for giving up on my fitness dreams. And this mocking didn't encourage me to get rid of it either because who doesn't like to wallow in misery and regret sometimes.

But today was the day I had enough and decided to vanquish it to the kitchen sink. What followed next when I pried open the shaker is a stench so retched, I will never forget it. It was like a mix of expired milk, rotten eggs and a faint hint of chocolate, basically it smelled like a sewage problem at the Wonka factory. I can still smell the stink in my nostrils 8 hours later. 

I ended up chucking the shaker in the bin as the plastic had somehow fused and molded into the chocolate sludge. So let this be a lesson to wash your shakers and not to give up on your fitness dreams. 

TL/DR I didn't wash my protein shaker for 9 months and it ruined my nostrils.",7,4,tifu
t3_krb9ut,TIFU by letting my mom watch unholy anime,"First of all, I'm sorry for my bad english.

This happened a while ago, back in september 2020. One day, I decided to watch an anime movie called Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel II. I've watched several animes from the Fate franchise, most of them in the living room's TV, it didn't contain things like nudity, just a bit of violence. So it was gonna be alright this time too, right?

Right?

I donwloaded the movie and started watching it on the TV. My parents were working from home, but I didn't think it was that big of deal. Thirty minutes into the anime, things started getting a little...weird. I started questioning if this was a good ideia. Then, one of the characters start undressing. And after this, there is the sex scene.

And of course my mom would appear in that exact moment. Not in any of the amazing fight scenes, nooooo. It had to be in the god damn sex scene.

So my mom almost didn't let me watch anime anymore, if it wasn't for my dad, he didn't make a big deal out of it. But yeah, my mom still gives me that disgusted look when I'm watching anything.

I didn't really fuck up things that bad, just wanted to share this story with you. Besides this little incident, it's a great movie, can't wait for the sequel!

He has been asking for one for the past  4 years and my wife and I decided we were ready. My kid has been a superstar about taking the puppy outside and cleaning up after him when necessary. The puppy is pretty good about letting us know when he needs to go outside to potty. He has had a few pee accidents but hasn't dropped any dueces in the house so far. Today is the first day that my kid went back to school and my wife and I both had to work. We used baby gates to isolate the puppy to the kitchen. My wife came home at lunch to take the puppy outside and I got home a few hours after that. I beat my kid's bus by about 15 minutes and rushed to check on the puppy. Sweet, no accidents. I scoop him up and take him out to the backyard. The puppy quickly takes a leak and starts attacking a nearby leaf. I let him play for a couple more minutes and take him back inside. This is where the FU begins, I noticed the house was a little messy and we just got a brand new robot vacuum for Christmas. I grab the remote for the vacuum, get it started and hop in the shower. I take a quick one since my kid will be home in a few minutes. All finished, I towel off, get dressed and walk out of my room just as my kid comes in the front door. ""How was you day kiddo"" I ask. He replied with ""it was ok, why does it smell like poop in here?"" Instantly I catch a wiff as well and we both begin to look for source. I see a brown streak across the living room carpet and my son finds a similar streak in the dining room next to 1/2 of a fresh  pile of shit. Weird, I thought, did the puppy step in it? Nope our new vacuum went straight through the hot steaming pile and proceeded to cover our entire 1st floor with muddy melted peanut buttery puppy poop. My kid picks up the vacuum and gets shit it all over his hands. The puppy has walked though it several times now. My wife comes home as we are struggling to clean up and once she realizes what happened, she busts out laughing. I send my kid to take a bath and my wife starts cleaning the floors while I clean the vacuum. OMG it was every where. The wheels, the spinny thingies, the filter, it took me two hours to clean the damn thing and almost as long for my wife to clean the floors. Once we were finished I looked down to see my new puppy taking a leak on the kitchen floor.

Happened 2 years ago. I was 24m then. My family went on a little snow day trip to an area just under bear mountain in California. Like, the ghetto area that‚Äôs free with sludgy snow. 

I‚Äôm not a snow person, I live in sunny soCal, but I know this area had that really bad type of snow that‚Äôs not fun to play with and definitely not fun to sled on.

This little free ghetto area had some trash can lids that other people left behind. It wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äòbring your own sled‚Äô type of deal, everyone here seemed to not mind sharing.

People were taking turns sledding casually on what was essentially hard ice from the Middle of the hill. But my turn came up, and the genius that I am thought, ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt anyone sledding from atop of this 50ft hill? Looks way more fun from up there!‚Äù

I went up there and felt bolder (stupider) than everyone else. This was surely going to be fun. 
I sled... fast. I had absolutely no control and was heading straight for a huge tree...until I slammed into 2 little kids. Both probably around 10 years old.

Their little bodies probably saved my life. 

One boy and one girl. The boy kind of ricocheted from the impact but the girl took the full blunt of my 160lbs body. I didn‚Äôt know these kids or their family at all. The parents were mad. My family calmed them saying it was just an accident and that everyone was fine, just some bruising (despite the little girl uncontrollably crying.) 

I felt so bad, I pretty much ruined another family‚Äôs ghetto snow day, but all I can think about was that these 2 kids‚Äô frail bodies saved me from sledding head first into a tree, and I was kind of thankful for that.

My little family of four went out with my aunt and our little cousin to eat. While my mom was filling up the car with gas, I realized we were very close to a park with a view point of the city (won‚Äôt say where out of privacy), so we set the GPS and went there. It‚Äôs a very pretty place, except the trash that flew out due to the very.. minimal care. We were taking some pictures and were having a good time. My younger sister said she needed to use the restroom, but she didn‚Äôt want to go alone and wanted to make sure the doors weren‚Äôt locked, so i went with her. We notice a guy, Honduran most likely, following behind us. I, being a guy, tried to put on a strong face to let him know that i‚Äôd hurt him if he tried to get to my sister. He ended up walking around the building and we really didn‚Äôt see him afterwards. 

My sister and i ended up walking back since the doors were locked, and saw my mom and aunt talking to a small lady, probably also either Honduran or Guatemalan. We got close to them and even with the accent, i was able to pick up on it (i only really speak english and mexican spanish) and found out she was telling my mom and aunt that the guy that had followed us was hitting her and threatened to kill her. 

As someone who was in a situation similar to that, I got really angry and stayed alert the whole time. At one point my mom tells the lady to go check on her child that was left in the car, and the lady responds ‚ÄúNo, you go check on him, i‚Äôm scared. Please help me.‚Äù My mom, as she already had told her before, said ‚ÄúI really can‚Äôt help you with anything other than calling the police.‚Äù 

The woman snapped back ‚ÄúWell, are you going to f***ing help me or not?‚Äù A car came driving by and a man stepped out, talked to the woman, and took her child and her things and put them in the car. He looked at us and winced before hopping back in the car and yelled something at her. ‚ÄúLook, If you‚Äôre not going to help me, i‚Äôm going to leave‚Äù was the last thing she told us before running in the car and left.

The man from before came out and yelled at us ‚ÄúWhere the hell did she run to now?‚Äù 
We ignored him and ran back to our car as yet another dude comes up and starts talking to him. In fear of a gun fight or something, we sped off. I think the only thing that scared me more was the woman. She didn‚Äôt give clear answers and she wasn‚Äôt crying with tears. she looked drunk/drugged. None of us could tell if it was all staged so they could hurt us or something of the sort since we were all mostly women (and i still kind of look like one).

It all started when I met my ex girlfriend to go and visit my daughter (she was on a camping trip with my exes parents) and after having a pretty good time driving and talking to her she suggests I spend the night at her place to make it easier in the morning when her parents get back with the kid. We're just hanging out in the living room when she asks me if I want to smoke a little weed. I agree. Now my weed smoking history is little to none. I have smoked a couple times before but it must've not been enough because I didn't even feel high or even a buzz. This time however I really did want to have a nice time chilling with my ex (wanting to get back with her but its complicated) so I take about 4 big hits and prepare to chill the fuck out. This was a huge mistake. 

As soon as I start feeling it my heart starts racing so fast I thought it might burst out of my chest. Everything was going in slow motion and if I didn't move I froze in place not being able to move. I might have fainted but I can't remember. It is so hard to describe what I was feeling but it was NOT good. I tried telling my ex this but it was so hard to talk and I couldn't quite make the words come out right. She was starting to get really freaked out and this caused me to start having a panic attack. This would be the first of many panic attacks and paranoia. All the while my ex was freaking out and wouldn't come near me and getting ready to leave. I couldn't understand what was going on so I was truly scared and thought I was going to die. I felt like I had to manually breathe and if I stopped I wouldn't be able to breathe anymore. 

I was finally able to lie down on the couch and try to sleep it off. She decides to order food and asks me if I could pay which I agree. But then I start thinking that she is using me for my money (paranoia) and start having another panic attack. The food arrives and I try to eat but I just can't eat anything at all. After all of that I lay down and finally have some much needed rest. But this is also when the terrible nightmares started and I couldn't sleep much. Today when I woke up I tried apologizing but she kinda doesn't acknowledge me and leaves for work. I'm worried this will kinda ruin the relationship we have now and I am also very embarrassed that this happened the way it did.

If you've been on a typical early morning Chengdu metro, you'll know they are packed like sardines in a cans - extremely full!.

I tried to remove it but it wasn't budging. Normally, the door would open at the next stop, no problem! There was a problem, though. The next stop, the doors switched, so the door opposite opened and the door that I was attached to would remain closed until the terminal 1.5 hours away. I spent the rest of the journey leaning on the door, hiding my bag, pretending there was no issue. If my bag was empty, I probably would have just got off and left it in the door as a work of art. At the terminal, I notified a conductor who had to call an engineer. The engineer used some tool to pry open the door. 30 mins later, and 2 hours after I set off, I was free. I told my employers and tried to laugh off the problem, but employers are often very direct in Chengdu. They just gave me a soft telling off for being late and deducted it from my salary.

This goes on and off being changed up with different pedantic variations such as ""sure you can see it"" and ""I mean I could, but the question is will I"". She also would get me with these as well much to my wife and hers delight.

This all picked up with a fervor this week, where we each got each other multiple times during dinner 3 nights in a row, until she ended it last night with the sweetest compliance I've seen in a while. We were having tacos, and without thinking I asked her ""Sweetie, will you please pass me the cheese"" without missing a beat, she grabs the cheese and throws it right at me. I wasn't expecting it and it smacks me right in the face. My wife and I just sit there staring at her mouths agape and all she says is ""You told me to pass the cheese"". Through the laughter and mild humiliation, I have never been more proud.

TL;DR- Pedantic dad raises a pedantic daughter and has a bag of cheese thrown in his face at dinner.",113,7,tifu
t3_kr9etl,TIFU by thinking my teacher was Tom Brady's mom.," Obligatory, this didn't happen today, it happened years ago actually.

This happened back in 2011, when I was just 7. As a young sports fan in Rhode Island who was starting to get to know his local sports teams (Patriots, Celtics, Red Sox, etc). My first day of school was in August, and I was one of those kids who had to stay in an extended day program where you hang out with teachers until your parents pick you up. My parents didn't neglect me or anything like that, it was because of their jobs and they didn't want me taking a school bus. One of the teachers who ran the program was an old woman named Mrs. Brady. So when I first met her, I was convinced she was Tom Brady's mother, because, well, same last name and I didn't know any better at the time. I didn't bother to ask, I was just convinced. In October, our school hosted a Halloween party, and Mrs. Brady said she was bringing her son. I was thinking in my mind, ""oh my goodness, I'm about to meet Tom Brady!""

Fast forward to the Halloween party, and I came in with my hopes up. I saw Mrs. Brady, and she pointed out her son, throwing around a football. I was totally thinking, ""oh my God! It's Tom Brady!"" Thank God I didn't say it out loud, because...

It wasn't Tom Brady. His name wasn't even Tom. I don't remember his real name, but I was disappointed.

TL;DR I was convinced my teacher was Tom Brady's mom, and when I met her son I was disappointed to see it wasn't him.",15,3,tifu

And there it was on 12 pt Calibri NSFW text seeing through my hell and embarrassing me. I quickly stopped sharing it and then deleted it and proceeded with the meeting.

ATM we‚Äôre at his mom place seeing his siblings and Mom, everyone but his mom are avid weed smokers, however his mom is not a total fan of such activities. 

We wait for his mom to pass out and then all take turns smoking bowls in the back. It‚Äôs our turn, load a bowl and step out to smoke. Everything‚Äôs going fine, I take a hit he takes a hit, peachy. Once we‚Äôre done we go to empty the bowl and my boyfriend blows the bowl of ash right up into his face and into his eye. 

Transition to the bathroom, he‚Äôs running water over his eye and trying to get the stuff out of his eye. The waters not really helping so he asks me to find him some eye drops. Now, I‚Äôm not very familiar with his moms house or medical supply stash. I‚Äôm high, a little freaked out because he‚Äôs freaked out, and digging through the drawers of pills like a starving raccoon in a dumpster. 

I finally find what I think are eye drops and bring them over to my poor unsuspecting boyfriend. He glances at them and full sends disaster into his eye. Instantly made a minor situation much worse. We basically dumped isopropyl and salt into his eye, escalating the pain tenfold. 

Now he‚Äôs in the kitchen, running water over his eye and doing what we can to sooth his burning eye. I finally find actual eye drops and try to use those to flush his eye even more. 

The situation doesn‚Äôt improve and eventually his mom and everyone gets involved. We can‚Äôt do much for the pain, but eventually we decide it‚Äôs best if he just lays down and goes to sleep.    

Even sleeping is hard but with some sleeping meds and a little distraction he‚Äôs out. Feeling better today, still irritated and needs an eye patch as bright light doesn‚Äôt help.

t3_kr8vpf,TIFU by not exiting Bulbapedia on my phone.,"This FU technically occurred yesterday, but the consequences are occurring today.

Me and my friends are all competing in a Pokemon Sun and Moon ""race,"" and since my memory on things like game mechanics and type advantages has gotten rusty, I've been using Bulbapedia (a very useful Pokemon wiki) to check that kind of stuff and gain the upper hand.  Typically, I use the site on my computer instead of my easier-to-access cell phone.  This is because of screen time limits: because I use my phone too much, I helped my parents set up a screen time limit that disables non-essential phone apps and websites after two hours of use.

Now we begin the mess-up: yesterday, my computer was inaccessible and I needed to see on what route I could get myself a riolu, so I went on my phone to look it up on Bulbapedia.  I had only two minutes of screen time left, so I wasn't able to get the information before my phone timed out.  *No matter,* I thought.  *I can just look it up on a different device.*  So I put my phone in the kitchen in sleep mode, and went on with my day.

Unbeknownst to me, the website was still running on my phone - I didn't close the site.  That's my mistake right there, was that I left it open.  I don't know how it remained active in sleep mode, but Bulbapedia was still on.  And it was on the rest of the day.  And it was on the whole night.  And it was still running for just shy of a full 24 hours.  Even though my phone was in sleep mode, even though my phone had another restriction (downtime) activate from last night to 9 AM today, Bulbagarden managed to run despite the odds.  My phone easily ran out of screen time before I even touched it today, and now I can't use it to talk with friends on Discord or to do anything fun and distracting today, simply because of a website on Safari pulling a fast one on me.

Now, you may be wondering, ""Infernoking23, this sure does suck, but there's no real consequence in this story.  What makes your baby-hands tale worthy of sharing the same digital space as legendary nursery rhymes like [the Major Tom technique](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c7kqjl/tifu_by_performing_the_major_tom_technique_and/) and [El Coconut Fleshlight](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6rr6ay/tifu_by_cumming_into_a_coconut/)?""  See, that's because I was going to use my phone while my foot got meddled with.  Let me elaborate: I have three planters warts on my right foot, with two of them being on my toes.  I have to go to the doctor's office today because they are contagious, and I'm getting injections to wipe them from existence.  The problem with that is, I'm scared as shit about the appointment, so I wanted to use my phone and watch some YouTube videos to keep my mind off the hour-long treatment.

But now that my phone is no longer usable, that means I have nothing to keep my thoughts off the dreadful appointment.  My FU of not closing Bulbapedia means the next hour of my life is going to be fucking terrifying.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - Didn't close a website on Safari while screen time was disabling it, which somehow ran for almost 24 hours and drained today's screen time.  This means I can't use it to entertain and distract from an hour-long foot doctor appointment where I get toe injections.  God fucking dammit.",8,2,tifu

the post about moisturizing soaps and real soaps reminded me abut this

i was the girl that always had lotion with her so whenever people needed lotion they would always come to me for it, i got frustrated with giving people all the expensive smelly lotions i liked so i started bringing whatever travel size lotion we ended up having at home.

I hate Olay whenever i use it i just feel weird all over so when i ended up with a travel size olay bottle i resigned myself to not using lotion at school till the bottle was empty but i kept giving it to people, then came the inevitable day that i needed to use lotion and of course i felt worse after using the olay so i went to wash it off but i didn't use the schools soap because i didnt want to further dry out my skin and thats when my face started lathering and becoming all bubbly and i looked at the bottle and it said body wash

t3_kr87ux,TIFU by adding coffee to my special cake,"This fuck up started January 1st and continued until yesterday.

My husband got some weed from a friend and since we have pretty much stopped smoking it I baked a cake instead. I have been doing this occasionally for the past couple of years instead of smoking since I don't enjoy smoke and smoking and I like the high better when I eat it. 

This time though, I decided to add some coffee to the mix. My mother in law gave us this nice carepackage as a christmas gift filled with delicious snacks, teas, homemade buns and some special Christmas coffee. The coffee has some orange, chocolate and nut taste. Pretty neat.

I had had a cup or two of this coffee to taste it, but I've actually cut way down on caffeine and actually quit a couple of months ago. I also don't eat a lot of sugar and I try to moderate alcohol. All this is because I have major anxiety and insomnia and I need to be careful about my blood sugar and so on. Since august 2019 I've hyperventilated and almost daily have shortness of breath so my body is telling me pretty clearly to chill out and treat myself better. My husband has also quit caffeine but for stomach reasons mostly.

Well, for some reason I thought it was the best idea to use this coffee that we would  not otherwise drink in the cake. And plenty of it too. It made for a nice wet brownie like cake and tasted delicious. 

Since we're both just home right now, we have been eating this cake everyday for the past four days! Cue surprised pikachu face when I get restless, kind of uncomfortable and can't breathe or sleep properly and not at all last night in spite of eating a goddamn weed cake that usually chills me out. Last night was the worst night. I was really tired and kind of dosed off only to be abruptly awaking by nothing really and then not being able to breathe properly because I can't calm down and then not getting any sleep the rest of the night. And insomnia always makes me feel so sick. Like I'm hung over and got the flu. I'm nauseous and so hungry it hurts without any appetite and I'm so thirsty but have to pee all the time even if I don't drink a lot so its impossible to even rest.

Then today it dawns on me that I totally forgot to google whether the caffeine stays in the cake when you add coffee, so I do and of course I learn that I've been on a four day caffeine bender (oh yes, I microdosed ALL DAY EVERYDAY) instead of having a nice four day chill out after the hassle December is. Awesome. 

I'm absolutely writing this down in my recipe! Never add coffee! üòÇ

t3_kr86ip,TIFU showing my main Reddit to my coworker... but not as much as he FU'd showing me his.,"Alternate account for privacy reasons. 

So, hey, coworker. If you are brave enough to come back to Reddit after today I am sorry I am telling Reddit about this but it is just too funny.

TL:DR at the bottom.

So I fuck up a lot in a day. Really, I could have posted here before a few times, but this really takes the cake. 

I (F) work in tech support. We pretty much all use Reddit. So when I posted a picture of my cat and it got over 1k likes, I was like hooray! Coolios! And I sent the link to 3 of my coworkers (M) to show how proud I was of her, and to give them a little chuckle cause they all like cats too.

Then I remembered oh, shit... i post NSFW stuff on my Reddit.

Now it's not what you think!! I was more embarassed that I had stuff tagged NSFW. I'm really into piercings/tattoos/mods and post mildly bloody stuff sometimes, so naturally they are flagged nsfw. Nothing I'd be fired about, but I didn't want them to think I was willy nilly posting nudes and linking people to my Reddit.

So I shared this funny little anxiety attack with the one coworker who had an incredible fuckup today.

I went on with my day and worked for oh, idk, an hour before checking in on the progress my cat had make with likes. 1.1k likes. Nice! And a new follower?? what a treat!

Oh, what a... weird pervy username? NSFW profile? Might be body mods though?

So I peeked behind my shoulder, no one in the office, and unblurred the images.

Oh MAN that's a lot of dong. Oh? He's holding a local brew? Oh... he's from the city I live in...

All the while sharing these findings with my coworker. 

Now, I say he's my coworker, as in we work IT for the same company. I mostly escalate work to his team and we have a good working relationship but we work with different teams at different sites. I've seen him in person 3 times, total. I hardly recognized him on the street to be perfectly honest, we talk over the phone or through the work IM system.

So anyway I'm describing this pervy weirdo to my colleague because CRAZY COINCIDENCE, HE LIVES IN THE SAME CITY AS ME!

... I'm not very bright, guys.

Thank GOD I picked the right one of the 3 of my coworkers to present my findings to of this TOTALLY WACKY COINCIDENCE.

So he says ""oh god. Im sorry. I didnt know you could see who your followers were""

Cue cry-laughing at my desk. Guys I had to go into the utility room to call my best friend absolutely hysterical about this.

I ESCALATE TECH SUPPORT TO HIM. IT DID NOT OCCURR TO ME THAT HE WOULD MAKE SUCH AN OVERSIGHT.

So yeah we talked about it. He's an incredibly valuable member of our team, super professional, and just a nice guy. Apparently with an exhibitionist streak...

TLDR: Shared a cat photo with my coworkers and was embarassed by some body mod posts I made being marked NSFW. One coworker followed me and did not know I could see all of his very NSFW nude content.

I am not going to HR. I told my husband who also knows him. We had a really good laugh about it. Resuming business as usual tomorrow.

Edit: typo

Edit 2: minor details that would've bugged me

Edit 3: oh yeah... after he calmed down a bit I told him that when you delete your Reddit account it doesn't actually delete the photos so they're still just there chillin. He said he felt less awful now that he's calmed down, and he'll deal with it another time. What's done is done ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

t3_kr834w,TIFU by being too reliant on my Google pixel 3XL and showing my dad's friend a cherry pink soft silicone dildo.,"This mortification actually happened today, I know, unfuckingbelievable.

Last week I encountered a small problem with electricity at my house, And my dad have a friend who's an electrician, so he offered to help me over zoom with a discount. 

I took all the pictures of the cables and electricity box, and the magic alien genies that create all the energy I used to power my house.

Then I opened up my Google photos on my computer where I had zoom open, and screen shared my Google photos so he can see them.

This is the part where I am a fucking diabolical idiot.

Last night, I had screenshotted a dildo I kind of want to get, as a small reminder.

Turns out that was a really successful move, since I'm going to remember it till I die.

Right before the meeting, when I took all the photos as needed, I archived the dildo screenshot, so it won't show up on my photos, and unless I specifically go to a folder and open it. 

My Google pixel phone have the Google photos app, and it automatically syncs to my computer.

I love this phone, and I swear this is not a commercial.

I screenshared all the electricity stuff I don't understand, and he asked me to scroll back to see the first photo again, and like the  dumb idiot with 5 thumbs on each hand, I accidentally scrolled up too far.

I only archived the photos about a minute ago, and today, it didn't load yet on my computer. It was still in my photos gallery, not in a private folder

When that showed up on screen, I was in shock, and it took me like at least 3 seconds to go back, And I'm pretty sure he saw it too.

Because he asked me: ""did you need me to help fix that too? Because it looks like it's battery operated, you don't need to plug it in to any outlets right.""

My cheeks were just as pink as the dildo, And I asked him a quick question on some dumb cables, And he chuckled and answered them.

And now let me share my embarrassment with all of you adorable goofballs, laugh ahead.

t3_kr789n,TIFU petsitting,"So this happened a few days ago but I thought it would fit this subreddit. For the past few weeks I‚Äôve been petsitting for my neighbors while they‚Äôve been out and while there are minor mishaps, everything was going smoothly until a few days ago. My neighbors have a chicken coop in their backyard with a fenced in pen connected to it so that they can be let outside and there‚Äôs also a little door that slides over the exit so that they can be locked in. 

So, the routine is to let them out of the coop in the morning and feed them and fill up their water. I let them out and decided to hang out for a few minutes on my phone on one of their outdoor seating areas and then suddenly the chickens started frantically screeching at the top of their lungs. I fucking BOOKED it to the pen and saw a hawk fly out just as I got there. I thought, ‚Äúokay, crisis averted‚Äù but texted my neighbors to let them know just in case and they said to keep an eye on them so I hung out for a little longer and I heard the screeching again. This time I had to scream and clap at ANOTHER hawk and it eventually flew off but perched 

on a tree nearby. 
I told my neighbors it happened again and they said I should try to get the chickens in the coop and lock them in, so I opened the door and tried to entice them to go in by shaking their food and eventually all but three went inside. There‚Äôs about 16 so most of them had gone in. However, the three remaining in the outdoor pen were a problem. I tried chasing them around the pen and jumping and catching them but chickens are fucking FAST and it proved impossible. I again texted my neighbors asking what to do and they said that I could try and use some orange ribbon (the kind used to mark property lines) they had in their garage to tie up some of the bushes in the pen so I could get to them easier. 

So I followed their advice and the ribbon was pretty tangled around these three wooden stakes so I spend around 10 minutes just sitting on their living room floor just trying to untangle it. When I finally got it decently untangled, I went out to the coop with it and I saw a hawk and clapped at it hard until I saw it fly off. But by then it was too late and I saw a chicken laying limp on the ground and my stomach dropped. 

It was pretty clear it was dead or dying so I started freaking out but I knew I had to get the last two chickens in so I spent a long time trying to entice the two other chickens in while keeping the 13 other chickens in the coop at the same time and one of the last two eventually walked in and after countless attempts I eventually lunged and caught the other chicken and chucked her in the coop. Then I had to face what happened. My eyes started to water and I called my neighbors to tell them what had happened. Thankfully, they were pretty understanding and didn‚Äôt blame me and said I had to *bury* it. I walked over to the chicken and checked to see if it was possibly still alive but it wasn‚Äôt very warm and it looked like the hawk had snapped it‚Äôs neck so it was definitely dead. 

I picked it up and it‚Äôs head flopped around and I started uncontrollably sobbing. I just sat there petting the chicken and sobbing over it and saying that I was sorry for at least fifteen minutes. Then I had to find a shovel to bury it with. So I found a shovel and found a nice spot under a tree by the fence and dug a small grave for the chicken. I also put some leaves on the dirt so that it was more comfortable for the chicken (it just made me feel better). Then I went down to the creek nearby and found some pretty medium-sized white rocks and stacked them on top of each other on top of the grave and I tried to find some flowers but because it‚Äôs winter   there weren‚Äôt any nearby so I found a small branch with berries and laid it on the rocks. I cried for at least a solid hour that day and I had to go back and petsit and had to see the grave every day when going to the chicken coop.  So... yeah now I have trauma from petsitting. 

TLDR: I petsit chickens and when I was inside for a little, a hawk killed one of them and I had to bury it and make a grave for it in their backyard ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢",9,1,tifu

We made it back to my house where her car was and I'm thinking she's going to head home since she works at like 7am the next morning. She wants to hangout more so we go in, meet my roommates, eventually go to my room. We play Mario kart and eventually I get her playing Celeste (awesome game btw). 

 Throughout game time we're slowly getting closer and eventually start making out. This is the turning point. She gets into it. Much more than I expected tbh. She climbs on top of me and she slowly starts grinding on my crotch area and I get into it and do it back. Eventually she pulls it out for a handy which I noticed didn't feel very good on one certain part of my penis. But like a champ I toughed it out till we were done.

 She leaves and I go to the bathroom to check out my willy. Come to find out my dick was being rubbed against my pants in a very unfortunate way to where the spot being grinded actually lost like, the top layer of skin. The spot itself was probably only like half an inch but my god it was so sensitive that even it touching my underwear sent a sharp pain.

We ate and everything was normal.

Went to sleep and woke up today normally. Went to the bathroom to take a shit and noticed there were tiny drops of oil in the toilet just there, floating with my shit, it was a very scary moment and I thought I was very sick. I noticed my underwear was dirty with some kind of oil, as well as my bed sheets.

Did some research and apparently what happened is that dogfish is so freaking oily that your body just cannot process all that oil and just gets rid of it through your ass, where the oil slowly leaks out of you. There is no way for you to notice this is happening, since the oil has the same temperature of your body and apparently your asshole is not tight enough to retain the oil, so it's kinda of an unnoticeable, unretainable diarrhea

So I get myself to her place for a whole day's visit, no car so it's busses and trains for me.
Without getting too graphic and sounding like a douchebag, we did this, this and that, she comes, we snuggle and take a nap.

Back up and at it, do that, that, and this, she comes. Now what's going through my mind is basically *the fuck can't I cum?*

t3_kr5rmr,TIFU by forcing air into my ear,"This happened last week but since the side-effects seem to have eased I can share it now. I have been using cotton-buds/cue-tips for many years to clean the inside of my ears, I kinda like the feeling of them but recently thought that my hearing may be degraded in my left ear so bought a special syringe to help me irrigate the ears and wash any wax out, I had also been spurred on by suggestions that cue-tips are really bad and force wax deep into the ear.

My ""irrigation kit"" arrived and I read and followed the instructions as I prepared to do the job. The instructions say to force air out of the syringe before drawing in the warm water, I did this then stuck the blighter into my ear (or at least tried to). I gave it a go and did feel water in my ear but not too much, I tried again a couple of times but on one of my goes I pushed the plunger all the way down and despite following the instructions there was a tiny air bubble in there which now got forced down my ear. Right away I felt a bit dizzy and add to that my ear had ""reverse"" popped so was a bit muffled. 

Not really realising what I had done I had another few goes but couldn't unblock my ear. I packed everything away and eventually through moving around realised that I had gone and rammed air into my ear and now pretty much had a little bubble inside my head (or it felt like it). It was weird, if I went up or down the stairs it was almost like the minute air pressure difference was felt in my head, if I leaned over I could feel the ""bubble"" move and it was the same if I lay in bed. I had recently been to the Doctor over a 2 month long headache which has now been identified as a sinus issue, they would have loved me if I went in again. 

Fortunately I didn't have to go back to the docs, it cleared itself one morning when lay in bed I felt and heard a little whoosh from that ear and it popped (though it still feels like there is something in there).

I haven't used the damn thing since and will stick to cue-tips :/

t3_kr5o03,"TIFU by misspelling the name of my to-be interviewer in my cover letter, and it is likely to be addressed in the ""Are you detail orientated?"" segment of said interview later today.","TL;DR I managed to misspell the name of my boss's sort-of boss in a cover letter when re-applying to my sort-of current job, and now it's going to be brought up within the interview I have today with half a dozen interviewers.

Just as a heads up, I am deliberately keeping various names/genders/details anonymous. Ya know, just to be safe. So, if my wording sounds a bit strange, that's \[mostly\] to blame. The actual F.U. was performed few weeks ago when I wrote the cover letter, but it all comes to a head today.

As per the title, I have an interview for a job in a few hours for a permanent administrative assistant position. A very detail-orientated job, indeed. I have actually already been doing remotely for some number of months, but just on a loose, per diem basis. They've approved of a regularly scheduled staff member now, and as I had originally fallen into it by way of mutual connection, I now have to formally apply and be hired for the position. The interview will be conducted by a half a dozen people or so, with my direct boss being the only one of whom I have so far met or even actually heard of prior to this formal \[re\]application process (the others are board members of some kind; in my mind it's an excessively large interview panel, given the actual job). Anyway, I was talking to said boss yesterday, asking if there was anything specific that I ought to do to prepare for the interview. Amongst all that was said, I was informed that I will be asked if I am ""attentive to detail"", and that I managed to misspell Shmidt, the names of one of those other interviewers, on the cover letter. I had written Schmidt. Which, I mean, damn it. Shmidt was the one whom I addressed the cover letter to, and appears to be who has the single largest influence on the hiring process. I was told Shmidt would be the one to likely ask me if I'm detail orientated, and just by the way it was worded, it is related to the misspelling.

On the one hand I should have caught it. It was an easy thing to do right, and I am both frustrated and embarrassed that I managed to mess *that* of all things up; it's the absolute worst word to have misspelled that I can think of - though I am sure there's a few other linguistic hiccups that would have been more embarrassing). What's worse is that I even double-checked that I was spelling the name correctly. But I had written it multiple times throughout the cover letter and the email I had sent it in, and just managed to add that extra C to one of them.

On the other hand...It's a single-letter typo. I would tear into anyone lambasting me or someone else for making any kind of big deal out of someone else's spelling mistake for any purpose other than just correct it. (In a hospital setting or at NASA where lives and millions/billion's of dollars are at stake, I'm a little more sympathetic. This is very much not that.) Trying to use this as a talking point in an interview to extrapolate whether I am attentive to detail is...frustrating, to say the least. I make spelling mistakes at roughly the same rate as any other human, but I make a distinction for one's capacity for details and the average rate we all make typos.

I honestly would have preferred to not know about this in advance, because I've now spent all last night and this morning thinking about, trying to determine the ""best"" response.",4,8,tifu
t3_kr5flb,TIFU by having a naked brawl in my dorm room and permanently scarring my history teacher.,"This happened about 2 years ago. For context I live in a high school dorm of all guys, and naturally we hang out a ton in each other‚Äôs rooms. That year my room was the central hang out zone and often I would let my friends chill out there when I had to leave real quick. One day I was in there with 2 friends and I had to go shower (I changed by putting the towel over me first and then unclothing) and I let my friends stay in my room while I was gone. Upon my return I kicked them both out cause it‚Äôs a lot more awkward getting changed from a towel to clothes, and I also wanted some alone time. Maybe I‚Äôm weird but when I‚Äôm alone in my room I like to just chill naked, idk it‚Äôs just more comfortable. 

Anyway this is the juicy part, so I‚Äôm kicked back in my recliner, butt naked and watching YouTube, when all of a sudden a hand emerges from my closet with a phone that‚Äôs recording. Following the hand and grinning mischievously is one of my dumbshit friends (not one of the two who were in there previously, apparently this guy had been hiding in my closet for over an hour playing brawl stars and waiting for the perfect moment to strike). Naturally I start freaking the fuck out and jump up from my recliner, using my laptop to cover my crotch as it was the only thing in close proximity to me. This whole time I‚Äôm screaming every profanity in my vocabulary at this dude to get tf out, but he won‚Äôt listen and keeps recording. I attempt to grab a pair of underwear, but I‚Äôm only able to swap them out with the laptop to cover my crotch, and don‚Äôt actually get the chance to put them on. I then grab this guy‚Äôs phone with one hand and attempt to wrestle it away, while elbowing him and covering my crotch with my underwear with the other hand. Naturally we‚Äôre making a lot of noise and I‚Äôm still screaming at him, and the two friends that I had just kicked out overhead from the hallway and are banging on the door wondering what kind of demon magically spawned in my room that caused me to make such a racket. Then to make matters worse the house advisor on the floor, a middle-aged female history teacher, hears the racket and decides to get involved, using her master key to unlock my door. Upon opening it she is graced with the sight of my naked body, only obstructed by a pair of underpants that I‚Äôm loosely holding over my crotch, in a full out wrestling match with this other dude, screaming my ass off. She screams so loud that the entire dorm heard her, and slams the door immediately. To make matters worse her seven year old son decided to come with her while she was on dorm duty, but thank god he was standing somewhat behind her and was shielded from the worst of it. After this my friend had a big OH SHIT moment and he got into some pretty serious trouble. But he was still my friend and so i didn‚Äôt mention the recording phone to the house advisor, cause that had grounds for some serious cp allegations and no one needed that, he ended up deleting the video anyway. But to top it all off this house advisor became my history teacher the next year, and I don‚Äôt think either of us ever fully recovered from the awkwardness. 

TL;DR Didn‚Äôt check my closet before being naked, ended up having to have a nude wrestling match with a dude that came out of it, house advisor saw it all and later had her as my history teacher.",127,14,tifu
t3_kr3xrg,TIFU by taking photos of myself in my new clothes,"TIFU by taking photos of myself in my new clothes

This happened a few minutes ago. Today my clothing sale haul arrived and I excitedly opened my parcels and tried on all my clothes. My mum had sent me a bit of money to help replenish my wardrobe in the sales (being a poor student I was super grateful and excited for the opportunity to buy clothes that weren't from Primark) so I thought I'd send her some photos of me trying them on seeing as I'm away at uni. I was having a great time enjoying my new clothes and taking funny photos. I particularly liked the new black shorts with fabric suspenders and I took a funny, mock sexy photo where I hold the suspenders and stare into the camera in a sultry way (with my tongue stuck out so it's a bit less serious).

Anyway I finish trying on my clothes and taking photos and I pick out the best to send to my mum. I also decided to send them to my grandma as I like to keep in contact with her. Once I've finished this I scroll through the photos I sent to my grandma to double check I didn't send the ones with my eyes closed. But then my eyes lock on to something in the background. Last night my boyfriend and I had gotten up to some fun in the bedroom and of course this was the one time we didn't bother to put the lube away. And yes. In the background of every photo I had sent. It was there (including in the mock sexy one). I died inside a little. I told my boyfriend and he said I could try and unsend them quickly but it was too late. They'd been sent and seen already by both my mum and my grandma. My boyfriend tried to reassure me. The bottle looks a lot like a hand soap bottle so he thought it might look like hand sanitiser. Yeah ok maybe it isn't that bad, I thought. But then he zoomed in a little to enhance the silhouette of two people going at it on the bottle. And next to the roll of toilet paper this really didn't look so good. I then realised that the empty chocolate wrappers strewn about next to them looked horribly like condom wrappers. At this point I want to jump out the window of our fourth floor flat. My boyfriend is laughing his arse off but telling me they probably won't notice and I'm curled up in bed now writing this in an attempt to find some humour in the situation so I don't want to cry.

TL;DR tried on my new clothes and sent photos to my mum and grandma only to realise there was a bottle of lube and toilet roll in the background along with some chocolate wrappers that looked like condom wrappers",18,55,tifu
t3_kr3vlo,TIFU by asking a blind man for his driver's license,"By ""today I fucked up"" I mean ""about fifteen years ago I fucked up.""

While a student in university, I had the privilege of working in our campus bookstore. It was a small university, and the bookstore staffed about 15 students, with two or three of us working at any given time. It was a wonderful experience and great way to meet new people (and would highly recommend to anyone in university or college now).

Anyway, one of our semi-regular customers was a ""mature"" student (he was probably in his 30s), who was visually-impaired. He carried a white cane and had a beautiful guide dog, and while he wasn't likely 100% blind (he was still regularly buying print-textbooks), he was clearly visually-impaired.

At the time, students could choose to pay for textbooks with debit/credit card, or by charging the books to their student account (which typically held the balance of their student loan). In order to charge to your student account, you needed either your student ID card, or your student number and a piece of photo ID.

So, when this man approached the register with his items and told me he wanted to charge them to his account, I asked for his student ID.

""Sorry,"" he told me, ""I don't have it with me.""

""No problem."" I replied, ""All I need is your student number and a driver's license.""

Silence.

My co-worker standing at the register beside me slowly turned her head to stare at me in disbelief of what she just heard.

""Um..."" the man said with a smirk, ""they don't really let me drive."" 

I can't remember exactly what happened after that because the embarrassment basically shut my brain off, but I think I said something like ""ugghghhhgghhhhhhhhh okay no problem"" and charged it without his ID and hid in the back of the store for the rest of the day. He was a very chill dude and clearly found my blunder funny, but it was too much for me to handle.

TL;DR Asked an obviously visually-impaired man for a ""driver's license"" rather than ""photo ID,"" embarrassed myself and maybe the man and probably his guide dog.",18,8,tifu
t3_kr3pcy,TIFU by trying to go to sleep,"So this just happened and i feel like i just got punched in the stomach, so let me explain, sometimes when I have problems sleeping I rub a quick one out because it really helps getting things out of my mind. So i go on ph like every other man and do my thing. And right before preparing to clean my mess, my fucking *sister* comes barging in my room. **Oh**. **My**. **Fucking.** **God**. I felt my heart drop to my stomach and start yelling to her to get the fuck out of my room but she looked at me for a literal fraction of a second and *realised* what i was doing and then she asked me where are her shoes, while i was with my wee wee in my hand trying to cover myself up, then she looks for the shoes (also i forgot to mention this all happened with the lights off so it was pretty dark except the lights from my window giving a bit of lights but just a bit), then holy fucking shit it gets even worse she only finds one of her shoes and i had to point with *the hand that i had done the deed with* to the other shoe, she picks up her shoe and then prepares to leave then my dad comes out the living room asking why am i shouting and then my sister tells him that i dont know what the hell am i doing and then she goes downstairs, i clean up my mess and then wonder what the hell am i going to do now and what could she say to my dad.

&amp;#x200B;

 TL;DR I tried to challange myself and stealthly steal my sisters shoes without her noticing, then i paid the price by her walking in on me rubbing one out whilst searching for her missing shoes.

Ok, so now that i have calmed down a bit i want to add some missing details i skipped in my panic.

My sisters room is right next to mine, in my lockdown boredom i decided to go in her room to rile her up a bit just for fun, you know banter between brothers type off stuff and i decided that i should try stealing her shoes ( they were some unicorn house shoes recieved as a new year present from one of her friends) and surprise surprise i sucedeed, i then went back in my room and continued playing some overwatch, then she notices her shoes are gone and that tracks back to what i wrote above, she comes barging in my room when i was doing the deed.

t3_kr3p0f,TIFU by asking my fellow campers to masterbate together.,"This happened about six or so years ago. I was at a summer aquatic's camp. Our Camp counselors had decided that we would all play a game together. I don't remember the name of the game, but it was in the same vain as Mafia or Among us. One of us kids was a killer and we needed to find out who it was. Being the eloquent genius that I am, I decided that I should speak up and say something witty. 

""We need to come together and contemplate!"" 

Well, that's what I had meant to say. Instead I decided to say ""We need to come together and masturbate!"" I had assumed that masturbate was a similar word to contemplate except for one key difference. Those who masterbate are masters. 

My flawed logic lead me to horrify the adult camp counselors and embarrass myself.


TL;DR: I said the word masturbate instead of contemplate during a camping game and made a fool of myself at age 11.",58,15,tifu
t3_kr2fx0,TIFU by getting a $70 parking ticket,"This story happened to me in February, and since I recently got Reddit I thought I would post about it. I'm a university student, who like many, am very broke. Because of this, I refuse to pay into the scam that is campus parking (it's $1220 for 8 months). They force us to purchase a $350 bus pass as well, therefore, it doesn't make sense for me to pay for a parking pass when I'm forced to pay for the bus. Anyways, onto the story. This one particular Thursday I had a night class and was planning to drive two hours afterwards to visit my boyfriend. I didn't want to pack up the car, take the bus to class, take the bus home, and then drive to see him (I'm also a little sketched out taking the bus at night alone). So I thought what the heck, I'll just risk parking on campus for four hours (this was my first time risking it). I figured that if I got a ticket I would pay the $20 and be on my way. So I drive to campus, park, and walk to get some food before my class starts. I come back to check my car before class and turns out I have a ticket. At a closer look, I realize that the ticket was $70 (another campus scam, in my opinion, the spots are never filled anyways). As I realise fuck up I start freaking out about the price. In the midst of this minor freak out, I ended up locking my keys in the car. Well great, now I'm going to miss class and there was no point in parking on campus in the first place. So I call CAA and they say they will be there in one hour. Two hours go by and I get a call, the CAA guy is lost on campus. About 30 minutes later he finds his way to me. He informs me that because of my older car it is going to be difficult for him to unlock it. So that took about 25 minutes. At this point, I have missed my class and decide to drive up to my boyfriend. On the way there, a raccoon ran out in front of my car on the highway so quickly that I did not have time to get out of the way. I hit it and it cracked the front of my car. I started crying, I felt so terrible. I thought to myself that this day could not get any worse, I was wrong. I got to my boyfriend's and we had to do some car switching so his roommate could go to work in the morning. I offered to back my boyfriend's car out of the driveway. He lives on a busy road so I was so concerned with the traffic that I totally did not see the huge traffic cone at the end of the driveway (not the little triangle ones, the huge striped cylinder looking ones). I heard a crunch and didn't know what to do.  In my fast thinking I decided to continue to roll over it (I later learned that that was a bad idea).  Luckily I didn't total his car I just broke the mudflap. His roommate witnessed the whole thing and now everyone makes fun of me for it. Needless to say, I had a lot of fuck ups that day.

TL;DR - I risked it, parked on campus, got a $70 ticket, locked my keys in the car, hit a raccoon, and drove over a massive traffic cone with my boyfriend's car, all in one day.",9,4,tifu

TL;DR at the bottom.

Context: I work at the flagship store for the biggest vape retailer in my country, I try work hard and be that sales clerk that treats customers like people, not wallets. Now, this store is big, and by big, I mean 10m long counter, flat screen, leather couches, pool, air hockey, and a fooseball table...

So... Today I had a guy come in with some short girl, I wasn't really focusing just tryna help him out as he had called in earlier asking about a specific flavored vape juice that was out of stock so I was trying to find him a similar alternative.

I grabbed some e-juice and came back to the counter as he said ""sorry sweetie, I know you hate it when I spend money on this stuff"" but, seemingly unbothered, she remained quiet and walked around checking out the fooseball and air hockey tables like most of the kids do. He says he's gonna step outside to test my proposed alternative (Can't vape in the store due to COVID regulations) and try the juice to see if he wants a second bottle. 

I'm busy ringing up the guys purchase and notice in the corner of my eye the little girl proceeding to sit in one of the chairs opposite the counter.
Now we've got a bag of lollipops for any kids that come into the store... It was sort of a Christmas thing, but seeing as we seldom see kids, we have plenty left.

Before he bounces outside, as I normally would, (because kids are often off in their own worlds) I say, confidently smiling to the dad, 
""I've got something that might make your daughter a little happier while she waits"" 
He chuckled...
""That's not my daughter"" 
Oh, whoops, he must feel really old now *internal face palm* that must be his little sister.
""That's my wife"" 
.......It wasn't, as I thought I'd seen out the corner of my eye, a kid... But a short and now slightly upset looking Asian lady.

I died internally, but the real punishment was yet to come:
I was then forced to make small talk with her while she waited for her husband to try the juice, making me shudder internally with embarrassment more and more with every passing second.
Then I was mocked by my best friend, and colleague for the remainder of the day.



TL;DR: Offered a customer's daughter a lollipop, nope... That's his small Asian wife. Shit.",21,6,tifu
t3_kr2aq9,TIFU by drinking,"A story for you

This happened last august but I have been too embarrassed to tell the tale... until now.

It was lockdown and I hadn't drunk in a while, my roommates and I bought a 26er of hennesy for a fun night of dominos w drinking rules. Everything was cool until I started losing each round and got VERY drunk. I didn't even realize how drunk I was until we left the game table and started freestyle rapping.. and recording it no less. the last thing I remember was eating some narsty McDonalds and trying to rap with my mouth full, then came darkness.

next thing I know, I woke up butt ass naked with nothing on but a durag. Oh boy was I in for a treat. My roommates wanted to spare me the details but I needed to know.

A few days after the events my closest roomie divulged the info; I guess I went to bed after the McDonalds but got back up a couple hours later and found my roomies in the living room. I stripped down to my birthday suit in front of them and sat on the couch. I was being the drunk naughty version of myself, I tried to broke someone's bong as a joke and went into someone elses room to scare them... ALL WHILE NAKED. they were trying to wrangle me and I was running around like a greased up hog. The mischievous behavior ended when the caught me and tried to give me my clothes... that's when I vomited all over myself, my clothing and them, then pissed right there in front of them in our hallway. they cleaned everything up and put me to bed. I guess I was still coherent enough to put on my durag though.

I was so embarrassed I think this sent my spiraling for a while and now Im sober so maybe this was all a good thing. hope y'all liked my story - I decided 2021 is my year of honesty and to come out of the shadows of being a reddit lurker.

t3_kr0xnu,"TIFU By Not Knowing How To Eat An Artichoke, Which Led To Me Arti-Choking","Obligitory ""this didn't happen today"" blah blah blah-

Some background: When I was 11 I was home schooled due to me being bullied and the school not doing shit, my mom was a single mother so unfortunately she couldn't take time off to stay home and teach me. Her best friend, being an absolute sweetheart, offered to teach me at her house until my mom got home from work each day.

My mom's friend (let's call her C) was the definition of ""fitness mom."" She took a literal 5k jog every morning, was on a diet, and gave her kids mostly healthy food. She was also way more religious than my mom, so things at her house were very different than things at my house were.

One day, my mom had to work late, so C offered to let me have dinner at her place until my mom showed up. I asked what we were having and she said ""artichokes."" Artichokes? The fuck is an artichoke? I didn't want to be rude, so I told her that I would like to stay for dinner. I sat at the dinner table as she finished up in the kitchen, she later came in with what looked like a bush on a plate. She and her family held hands and did their dinner prayer, while I looked at my plate with one thing on my mind, ""How the fuck am I supposed to eat this?""

Everyone began to dig in, I on the other hand was still staring at my plate. C had worked hard to make dinner, I wasn't about to just refuse to eat it. For all of you that don't know, you're supposed to eat an artichoke by picking off the leaves and scraping out the soft insides with your teeth, I on the other hand, did not bother to ask. So instead of asking how to eat this because I didn't want to be ""Rude,"" I picked off a leaf, and shoved the entire thing into my mouth.

The first thing I noticed was how hard it was to chew. Literally felt like I was trying to chew through a tire. C looked at me and smiled. ""Does it taste okay, OP?"" I didn't want to upset her so I just nodded my head. People were already almost done, and I think they noticed that I was just sitting there chewing the whole time. C looked concerned and asked me if I felt sick because I wasn't eating anything. It hit me that I needed to answer her, so I fucking SWALLOWED this whole ass artichoke leaf, and that's when I started choking. 

C ran over to me and started patting me back really hard, after about 10 seconds she hit my back hard enough so I coughed the damn thing back up. Where it proceeded to land in the center of the table, where the following conversation happened. 

C: Uhhhh, OP?

Anyways, this morning I was waiting outside the hospital and asked the doctor to come outside to tell me how he‚Äôs doing but instead my grandma came. She tells me he‚Äôs doing fine but is having some back pains and having trouble moving. She went back inside and I continued to wait. My parents were also here but only my mom was with me since this was my dads father. About 30 minutes after my grandma went back inside, my cousin, same cousin who tried to fight me and the uncle too, came over to see how he‚Äôs doing. As soon as they saw me, they came over and gave me some shit. I tried to ignore them. And it sort of worked. My uncle went inside, as he was my dads brother and wanted to see my grandpa. Right when my uncle walked in, my cousin, who is a year older than me came over and tried to get in my face. I told him to knock it off but he didn‚Äôt and I noticed at that point he was getting ready to punch me. I am a pretty big dude and he is a couple inches smaller than me. A fight ensues and I have the upper hand. Nearing the end of the fight, he‚Äôs getting weaker. And I try and back off, which he takes as a sign to go full blown batshit crazy. I defend and get him on the ground and he goes ballistic and started screaming in pain. My mom and I rush him inside for some help. 

The rest of it is fuzzy but I later heard I broke something in his right arm and all of that family has blocked me on everything and are planning on suing me. Funny thing is, my grandpa is a lawyer and he has told me stories of some of the cases he took.

Being silly and friendly I shout across to her ""yo, why you walking that way? Work's in the opposite direction!"" To which she replies ""I've just been fired.."" in a seemingly jokey tone. Joking about getting fired was also weirdly common where I worked too

Thinking she cant possibly be serious, I yell back ""haha, GOOD! see ya later dick head!""  Whilst waving my middle finger proudly in the air and grinning from ear to ear like an inflatable tube man.


10 minutes into my shift I'm told by a friend that she was in fact NOT joking and absolutely had been fired. This was a job she had told me she was excited about as it was big career change for her but she unfortunately didn't make it through probation...
This poor girl had stuck her neck out trying something new then basically been told she wasn't good enough, then my stupid ass cheerily rubbed salt into a very fresh wound.

I never saw her again and me calling her names, giving her the finger and exclaiming my joy at her dismissal will forever be her last memory of that job.

t3_kqypix,Tifu by running away from a guard dog and getting stuck with another one in a room.,"This happened 2 years ago actually. I was visiting Ba√±os, Ecuador. I had booked a room in one of the hotels. The hotel didn't have its own parking lot so there was a public parking lot across the street and I was told to park my car there for the night. So I went to park and paid the security guard sitting outside by the gate. And I went back to my room. 

A few hours later when I was getting ready for bed, I realized my phone charging cable was in the car, hooked up to the car charger. So I decided to go out to the car to grab it. Went out and saw the security guard wasn't there anymore. I Walked into the parking lot and it was pretty dark, I went to my car and opened door and as I opened it I was still looking around me in the dark, because I was worried about being robbed or something. I noticed a dog sleeping a few meters away from me. I am terribly afraid of dogs, of all kinds, big or small. I slowly grabbed my cable and when I closed the door, the dog woke up and started barking. I didn't know what to do, so I ran!

I ran out of the parking lot with the dog still chasing me, I had hoped it would stop once I'm out of the parking lot, but it still kept following me. I was very close to my hotel but realized I can't stop to open the door the dog is way too close, so I ran past the hotel and kept running. To make matters worse, a few other stray dogs started running after me too. I kept running for about a block and noticed a small shop on my right which had an opened sliding door and I ran in and closed the door. The dogs outside started barking and I prayed for them to leave. The stray dogs left and the guard dog kept barking for a bit but also left after a few minutes. 

I felt so relieved, but was still scared to go out. All this time I hadn't realized that I'm in someone's shop. I turned around and started calling out for someone to come and id explain why I'm actually inside. It was a small room and there was a door that went to the back, but I couldn't see anyone inside the shop. Eventually I started hearing a growl and saw another dog come from the door at the back of the shop and started barking at me. I honestly at that moment felt like I'm in some movie. Because this kinda stuff I've literally only seen happen in movies. I was hating on my bad luck at that moment. This dog was smaller than the previous guard dog but I was still just as scared. 

I turned around and opened the front door and decided to face the first dog if it's still out there because at least I could run from that one. But when I went out, I didn't see the dog, saw the strays but they didn't say or do anything. I went back to my hotel and could barely fall asleep. I was shaking with fear still.

Tldr: I ran from a guard dog and ran into a small shop to hide but only to be in a room now with another guard dog.",14,2,tifu
t3_kqy44u,TIFU by forcing my eyes when taking an eye test,"This happened a year and a half ago but realization only happened last week

18 months ago I got the amazing news that I had got the job I applied for, at the time, I had just finished college and was only working at a Burger Shop in a shopping centre

Coincidentally, I (32M) had just started my relationship with my partner (32F)

I decided that it was long due I had my eyes tested as I had been living here for 3 years and hadn't had  that done for at least 4 years

&amp;#x200B;

That is where the fuck up starts

Just some context, I have been wearing glasses since I was 7, my prescription is pretty high, I have 5.50+ on each eye also, -2.30 astigmatism on both eyes

Those who wear glasses, know how the test goes, they place a super funny machine in front of your eyes and ask you to read/tell if you can see letters in a small frame at some distance, normally 2 to 3 metres

Without realizing, I forced my eyes during the examination, at the end of it, my dumbass got really happy that my prescription had changed and I had gone from 5.50+ to 4.25 on both eyes, at last, finally some good news, maybe my prescription is decreasing as I age, even dreamt of not wearing my glasses at some point in my life

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a few months, the happy time at work is finished, it is time to get hands on as I start to get workload I start to few dizzy and my sleep pattern is completely fucked up, I can barely see the screen as after 30 seconds of focusing my sight, it all goes blurry, I get stressed like 200% as I am not being able to read on my Kindle or read the countless pages of documentation and lines of code and perform decently at my job

This has been going on for months, my relationship took a huge turn, we were fighting nearly daily, I am super stressed with everything, my libido is completely gone, depression tackles me really bad on top of all that is going on in the world right now

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks ago, it was about time to get new glasses, now I have a job that pays me decently and it is not a big deal

&amp;#x200B;

Eye test is taking longer than usual, during the consultation, the optometrist keeps asking me to relax my eyes and so I do it, after 30 minutes she is kind of surprised and asks me - Have you taken a new job where you use your eyes a lot or have you been feeling any difference in your sight and off I go explaining everything to her and she says, all your symptoms kind of connect to the lack you had in your prescription, all the exams came back Ok and I see no sign of any illnesses, I have been using the new ones for the past two weeks

My sleep has improved

My libido is getting back to normal

I can deliver at work

My relationship has improved

Moral of story, don't force your f\*cking eyes when taking an eye test

I apologize if any errors as English is not my native language

t3_kqxxgp,TIFU by saying an inspirational quote about going blind next to a guy with a glass eye.,"This actually happened like ten years ago, but I mark it as one of the greatest FU moments ever. 

I was having dinner with friends at a restaurant. At the time I frequently tried to sound smarter by saying inspirational quotes. And I was reading the autobiography of Gandhi. That was my time to shine.
I don't even remeber what was the ""trigger, but I really had to say it: ""An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind"".

All my friends were really impressed by what I just said but somehow I felt that the whole table next to us froze after I said it. I took a look and... I saw him. A guy with a glass eye that was visibly shaken and embarasses.

...sigh.

t3_kqwueh,TIFU by saving my cat from strangling herself,"In my apartment, I set up a cat tree for my 8 month old kitten right by our window so she could see outside while I was at work. Since I have blinds, my kitten would always bring the blind cords to the top of her cat tree and play with it. One night while I was making dinner, I hear a horrible noise and look over to see my cat dangling from the cat tree by her neck. I frantically rush over and see that she somehow managed to wrap the blind cord at least three times around her neck and her make-shift noose wasn't coming off easily. In the moment, I decided to lift her up to prevent her from hanging, and tried to spin her around to loosen the blind noose (I didn't have scissors nearby). Understandably, she was very scared and amid all the chaos, she bit down on my hand with a force so impressive, I needed to go to the hospital and get stitches. To make matters worse, this is when I discovered I was allergic to cats. Fortunately, she's ok, and yes, I cut off the cords to the blinds and got cheap curtains instead.

A bit of background, I have borderline personality disorder, and when I have an episode/flare up, I won't let my partner touch me. This often means that I'll lay in bed funny, ie head at the bottom of the bed, rather than where the pillows are.

This morning, I got up to put on breakfast, and then went back to bed while I wait for it to cook because it's cold. Not wanting to risk falling back to sleep, I started off sitting up with the duvet around my shoulders, but that started to hurt, so I layed down and continued my reddit browsing.

My partner suddenly sits up and calls my name, asking what I'm doing. He's just woken up, so has no context, other than, I'm in a position that might indicate an episode, and he went straight to ""talk her round"" mode.

TLDR: didn't wanna fall back to sleep, ended up worrying my partner that I was having a mental health crisis by not having my head on the pillows.

I walked for about an hour, which was actually nice without my phone, just me and the outside and soon I made it to where I knew I was. At that point I was confident I could make it home without collapsing but I was also hungry and I wanted to sit down at a Starbucks and relax with my phone. The problem was I didn‚Äôt have a charger and my phone was now at 4% so I could either continue till I got home and eat something there or I could buy a charger, which I was pretty sure I needed a spare, then charge my phone at Starbucks while on it. I decided to go with the second choice. I get the charger which was 35 bucks and then I reach the Starbucks and remember there‚Äôs a fucking pandemic so no seating. As I was already there and I was still hungry I bought myself a frappuccino and drank it on the walk back home. This would‚Äôve been bad enough but I discovered to my annoyance that I already had a spare at home which meant I had bought a charger for absolutely no reason at all.

So early yesterday night I was uncomfortable and kept thinking why and I uncomfortable? So I took off my clothes. I felt comfortable and rolled my self up in my blankets like a mummy and drifted off to sleep.

Then I had a dream I was in sum type of anime with weapons for handling and catching monsters. But the monster we were up against was a golden mewtow, but not just any mewtwo. One that is a mix between Alakazam and mewtwo both being the strongest and smartest monster he decided to turn invisible and in my dream I hit him hen I felt it he was trying to crush my nuts. 

I felt it and I was waking up?

Why am I waking up this is a new experience but not a bad one since it‚Äôs a dream?

Then as my dream crossed into blurry eye vision I saw I was snapping my fingers as my hands were reaching for my huevos 

Not just snapping with sound but the kind when you but your index fingers together an ü§û  spread your thumb out üëç so it kind of looks like this üëÜ and imagine it closing in on itself fast enough to make your dry ass hand make a friction noise and you got to on them coming for you precious eggs in between you legs hanging for a human bag.

t3_kqslv2,TIFU my first time buying condoms,"Posted this in r/sex yesterday but the mods eventually removed it because it didn't apply to that sub or something. Some of the comments suggested I come here. So here I am.

In a few days, if all goes well, I will no longer be a virgin. I've been doing everything possible to prepare for what's to come, which is how I ended up at the convenience store two days ago to purchase condoms for the first time ever. Not gonna lie, it did feel really awkward standing in a queue with a snickers bar in one hand and a box of condoms in the other. Maybe it was just my imagination but I could feel people staring. It also didn't help that on the box was a half naked woman preparing to take off her pants. If that wasn't awkward enough, as soon as the cashier had to scan my condoms, the scanner somehow stopped scanning. The cashier raised the box of condoms towards the heavens like it was baby Simba... just to check the big ass barcode printed on the bottom.

The cashier apologized and said she's new before proceeding to call one of the other cashiers to come over and assist. At that moment I was tempted to just abort the mission and leave, but I convinced myself it couldn't get any worse. I was wrong. Cashier #2 showed up, and lo and behold, it's one of the girls at my school. We're not friends or anything but we've seen each other at school enough times to prompt a ""hey you"". Cashier #2 noticed the condoms and I could tell, even behind her mask, she was struggling to keep a straight face. So, instead of just keeping my mouth shut, I blurted out ""it's for my dad!"". Both cashiers froze and looked at me like they were scared I was gonna go into more detail. Long story short, I got the condoms and got out, but now I got PTSD or some shit.

If it was any other product in the store, none of the above would've been weird. So why is buying condoms so damn awkward? Or maybe it's just me, I dunno. All I know is... I ain't going back there ever again. 

TL:DR Went shopping for condoms at the convenience store. It seemed like the people in the store were judging me. I became awkward and without thinking said the condoms were for my dad. My dad!!! Lol so stupid.",2569,253,tifu
t3_kqrcmm,TIFU by getting a covid test at the wrong place.,"I worked at a hole in the wall restaurant off the gulf coast in mid-Louisiana. We are in an area highly susceptible to hurricanes. For Hurricane Delta, the water rose up to the ceiling on the first level. I went back to work after about a month of cleanup and re building. A week or two later one of my coworkers tested positive when her high school opened back up. All 4 employees and the manager was forced by the owner to get tested. The manager and other 3 employees were mother/daughter/son/niece (respectively), so they all got tested together. The owner told us all he would pay us back for the test whatever the cost. The family of workers‚Äô tests costed $55 each, which I was not aware of. I went to one of the other urgent cares to get my test, which turned out to be $345 because my insurance wouldn‚Äôt cover it due to me having no symptoms. After 2 weeks of quarantine, the joint finally opened back up. When I would ask about getting repaid, which I was very open about the cost with them right when I was charged, the manager floundered about the idea another week and a half. I texted the owner himself so I could see about getting my money back, he told me they are ‚Äúliterally giving away free tests all over (city nearish me)‚Äù and told me he‚Äôd pay me a $55 copay. I texted back saying he could keep his $55 copay and I would no longer be working there.

I‚Äôm 17 and currently unemployed because of this. It‚Äôs hard to find a job around my area and especially at my age, and most of all working with my schedule being a high school senior.

Was I in the wrong for quitting on the spot or should they have been more than willing to be true to their word and pay me whatever cost the test was like they said they would?

(I drank Soju with my parents instead of our usual red wine not thinking that it would hit me so hard when I wake up. The soju was 350 ml and I drank half a bottle of it as it was very fruity. The soju hit me so hard that my parents wanted me to just rest but I insisted on going to classes as I didn't wanna miss anything important.)  So we were having classes and it was Off Cam so I was listening and at the same time, writing fanfiction. The fanfiction that I was writing had a kiss scene in this chapter and I wanted it to be a little spicy so I was editing and adding words and I finished writing it when our classes also finished. I took screenshots of it and sent it to the GC, not realizing that I sent it there first. When I looked at where I sent it, I panicked. I panicked to the point that our housemaid even got worried. I opened our GC and unsent the photos a few minutes after I sent them. 



The first persons who saw the photos were my two female teachers. I'm waiting for one of them to scold me but they didn't even say anything! No ""Don't do it again"" or ""Remove this immediately! What if the Principal sees this?!"" Just silence.



Now I'm just waiting for the scoldings and lectures to come. But no one said anything. This got me more worried and I won't be attending classes later as I'm still panicking. I just hoped they didn't have wifi or data so they won't see what I wrote but everyone has been silent.



Also, the last time my classmates sent something so ridiculous to our GC, they got scolded by the Principal himself and I'm scared if that will happen. Our Principal is strict hates any romantic talks, writings, or anything related to romance when it comes to us, his students.

It was around 10:00 pm when dinner was finally being put on the grill and we had 4 rib eyes. Both of my grandparents are in their late 80s and are getting very weak and fragile. As the steaks were being served, we all went far apart with our families. Not 2 minutes after we started eating, my grandpa started to choke and his face was getting red. Everyone started to panic, and as someone who knows the Heimlich maneuver, I ran over trying to keep my composure. While I was running over, I tripped and knocked my grandpa out of his seat causing all the other family to panic and yell at me. At this point I was freaking out but didn‚Äôt show and I started to perform the maneuver. I got the steak out of his mouth but he couldn‚Äôt move so we called an ambulance. Earlier today I found I broke his collar bone and dislocated his spine and he is getting surgery today.

t3_kqq3zu,"TIFU by saying ""hey look it's your boyfriend!""","This happened today and I'm now facepalming at the comment i made about my friend. 

Little bit of context: im living with my girlfriend's parent's and have been since everything started with the world circumstances and a different topic not for this sub. 

So my best friend let's call him R (16M) came out to me as bi romantic (for those of you who don't know it's romantic attraction to both genders) and im proud of him for coming out to me and my girlfriend K! (15F) Of course we supported him 


While we were supporting him and he and i (16F) were having a conversation with his girlfriend M (17F) and he seemed to calm down a bit until the dumbass inside of me decided to pull his strings a bit here comes the FU. 

So the 4 of us were having a conversation which eventually lead to video call (something we do fairly often and we love it) 

K was watching dragon ball super which was an interest both of them shared and a scene came up where Android 17 came up (his favorite character) and i proudly yelled ""hey R look it's your boyfriend!"" while pointing the camera at the TV while laughing my ass off after.

R quickly excused himself and turned off his camera and i later found out that his notifications were probably turned off considering he wasn't texting K and hasn't spoken since. 

M and K told me that my joke really wasn't funny and ""he's still very embarrassed you should be more considerate"" and proceeded with about a 20 minute lecture but K wasn't mad M however...Just a little bit 

Tl;Dr made a joke about my friend being Bi turned his face into a cherry and got a lecture",0,4,tifu

Let me preface this by saying I was/am stoned, watching Jumanji, and on Facebook half paying attention. I was scrolling through my feed and saw one of my good friends post a photo of his dog with a caption. From what I remember, it said something to the extent of ‚ÄúMy buddy, love you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù. It had no comments or likes so I thought it would be funny to comment ‚Äúfirst like‚Äù. 

I leave Facebook and continue watching the movie. About 10 minutes later I return to Facebook and start scrolling...once again. I came across the post a second time and read the caption only to find out it was a post about HIS DOG WHO HAD JUST DIED. 

The shame. The embarrassment. 

I immediately messaged him to tell him I‚Äôm sorry for the comment and how sorry I was to hear about his dog. I explained myself and no response. About 5 minutes later he got back to me and said it actually cracked him up and made his day a little better. 

Forgot me friends have a sense of humor. Thank god for that!

t3_kqq2on,TIFU by watching my car roll backwards down the driveway on it's way to the corner light pole and fire hydrant.,"This happened a few years ago.

I had returned home with my dog after an outing and pulled into the garage.  I disconnected him from his safety harness and connected him to the leash.  As we walked up the stairs to the door I hit the button to close the garage door. I hear the door starting to close and then immediately retract.  I stand there for a few milliseconds thinking something is breaking the beam and preventing an accidental closure.  I turn around to look back to discover that what is breaking the beam is my car rolling out of the garage down the driveway because I forgot to pull the parking brake (I had a manual transmission at the time).  My dog can be a runaway so I'm standing there thinking ""Do I run with the dog to the car or drop the leash or...""  Finally, I drop the leash and thankfully was able to jump into the car and pull the brake before it entered the corner intersection and crashed into the light pole or a nearby fire hydrant.  Then in a panic, jumped out of the car to grab the dog and into the house.  After I get the car secured in the garage, I make a trip straight to the liquor cabinet to down some Irish whisky. The next car was an automatic.

t3_kqpelz,"TIFU by almost touching an art piece by Giuseppe Arcimboldo, and sounding an alarm which called security","So this happened many years ago when I was still a kid, so i guess it wouldn‚Äôt be TIFU, but i would really like to get this story off of my chest. So i was in an art museum in France that was not the Louve ( sorry if i misspelled that), but it was still a pretty big art museum that had many famous collections, of which one of them was a room full of paintings by Giuseppe Arcimboldo (for those of you who don‚Äôt know he was the artist that made the paintings of people made of food and other random things). So let me start by saying that i had been walking all day and was therefore very tired, you know when your in a new city you wanna see everything so you decide to walk everywhere, so my back was absolutely killing me, but we were in a rush to see everything since the museum was closing soon so there wasn‚Äôt a chance for me to sit down. So there I was walking enjoying the paintings when i reached the room, or better say the hallway of where the said painting were kept
and decided to walk up to the painting to get a better look, so here is where the FU happens. I turned around to talk to my brother and decided to put my hand on the wall for a little bit of rest, however before i realized what i was doing my finger tip had already grazed the loose wall that holds up the painting ( for those of you who are confused, in this art museum they hung up the works on separate stands and surround them with cloth walls so that if anyone tried to touch them a sensor would go off once the cloth moved). So after barely grazing the cloth a super loud alarm goes off and I completely freaked out, and bolted out of the room as fast as I could without looking like i was running away from a crime scene, which a obviously was, and in the corner of my eyes i saw that there were cameras pointing directly at the art works. My mind went through a million thoughts, what if they dragged me out of the museum? There were cameras so they knew it was me, so here i was freaking out thinking the worse would happen to me, so to calm me down my aunt who was with us took us to the little cafe area that was in the middle of the museum to sit down and drink something, but just as i thought that maybe everything would be ok, a lady which looks like the manager of the museum comes in with what looks like security staff. Now here I really thought something would happen, but the woman just walked passed our table without even looking at me and we left a little bit later. Most likely the staff of the museum looked over the museum video tapes and saw that I had not actually touched any of the art pieces and only grazed the wall by accident and decided to not really do anything. Let me just say that I am never getting that close to valuable art pieces again in the future.

TL;DR I accidentally grazed the wall surrounding very valuable paintings and set off a very loud alarm which called security",5,5,tifu
t3_kqpbl1,TIFU by giving myself an EXPLOSIVE chronic illness and racking up $1000 doctor bill,"So as per usual this didnt FU didnt start today but I have confirmed my suspicions today. Also sorry if the format is shit, I'm on mobile. 

Last year a couple months into the pandemic I quit my job (another FU but I digress). So after a couple weeks of binge drinking I severely screwed up my sleep schedule. Welp picked up these nice melatonin gummies so I could start getting a proper night of sleep before I started my new job at a butcher shop. Also since I was trying to get my shit together I started the keto diet. 

Fast forward about a week and I wake up to a seriously rumbling, very angry stomach. I go downstairs to go to the bathroom but my fiance is in there taking his morning shit. Theres no other bathroom in the house and I'm yelling at the door for him to hurry up. I'm clenching my butt cheeks but what I think is a fart is coming. It was not a fart. I'm like wtf is happening I'm an adult. 

The next 4 weeks at least I'm having this *problem* everyday, sometimes up to TEN TIMES. Alright I go to google and see if it could be my diet. Yes, Keto poops are a thing so I'm like there we go easy fix start eating normally again. NOPE. still having cramps and explosive relentless diarrhea. 

I decide to go to the doctor to figure this out cuz it's really bumming me out. I miraculously get in that day. They run a covid test, a couple blood tests, and give me an abdominal xray. They also send me home with a stool test. I return the stool test the next day. 

When I get the results everything is negative or normal. All my blood levels are fine, no infection, no infestation of worms. Doctor says schedule a follow up appointment. I'm like alright but then I see my bill. Comes to a little under $1000 dollars. I cant afford to go back. 

I look into all my test results and I guess sometimes the test for worms comes back as a false negative. And I'm like oh the job I started at is a butcher shop that could be it. I bought myself an over the counter treatment for worms thinking that will do the trick. Yet again no.

So now I'm getting stressed. I have IBS or crohn's. Some time later I'm going up to bed and I'm just curiously looking up the side effects of melatonin... YOU GOTTA BE SHITTING ME. *this* is a side effect. I stopped taking it and it stopped happening.

Fast forward to the last week. I'm jobless again and I have succeeded in screwing up my sleep schedule. I guess I'll take one melatonin gummy before bed and risk *the issue* for a good night's sleep.

Well, today I can tell you, it DEFINITELY IS THE MELATONIN! NEVER AGAIN!

t3_kqp8k6,TIFU cause my girlfriend thinks I have a small dick,"So basically I've been seeing this girl for a few weeks now. Last weekend she came over while my parents were out. We ordered a pizza and watched some show on netflix. After a few episodes, she grabbed me by the hand and began leading me somewhere. I was rock hard and she was wearing booty shorts so I knew it was time to smash. She asked me where my room was and I told her to guess. She picked the wrong door, my brother's room. He had his hentai porn posters all over the wall and a bottle of lotion on his bed. A little bit of the lotion was on his sheets. Now, whether that was lotion or something else, we sure as hell didn't stick around long enough to find out

We walked out and shut the door behind us. I told her where my room is.  I was so excited to smash but when we walked in there was a few boxes of extra small condoms. Those were the ones my brother uses on the rare occasion he gets lucky and for some reason he left them in my room. She giggled a little before closing her mouth with her hand. I told her these weren't mine but obviously she was skeptical. ""*F\*ck it""* I thought to myself. I grabbed my waist and desperately began trying to take my jeans off so she can see I don't have a small dick. But over the holidays I gained a few pounds. I've always been a smaller guy and you wouldn't really be able to notice but the jeans were tight to begin with. As I was struggling and groaning, she told me she has to leave and walked out

I'm really pissed off now and I don't have the balls to message her because I'm too embarrassed

t3_kqora7,TIFU Cringe Moment At A Friend's Wedding,"This happened a long time ago. I was young, and as you will soon find out, very dumb and socially awkward.

I had a guy friend whom I met while out clubbing in my very early 20's. He started dating a really nice girl. I eventually befriended the girl as well. They got engaged somewhat quickly and the day of the wedding had arrived.

The groom was not close with his family, so they didn't attend the wedding. There was no wedding party and the guests were all of the bride's family/friends. I didn't know a single one of them and instead of recognizing this as an opportunity to meet new people, my anxiety riddled, introverted ass mostly hung out with the bride and tried to be helpful if she needed anything. 

I went to the bathroom and heard noises coming from one of the stalls. I began worrying that this person might need some kind of help that I was 100% not equipped to provide, but I also didn't want to make a scene. I wondered how to resolve this discreetly without alerting guests. So what did I do? I STUPIDLY went to the bride and told her. She replied, ""Yes, I know. It's my mother and she's been crying in the bathroom for a while now. She doesn't approve of the marriage and is really upset about it."" 

ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è This was news to me and I was all OMG, what have I done? üò± Just instant regret for all of my actions.

t3_kqo34c,TIFU by using the family camera to take nudes.,"This happened 3 years ago. I (gay M) was 18 and really horny and I had decided to take nudes of myself to boost my confidence. For some reason I thought my own phone wasn't ""good"" enough to take those pictures so I decided to use the camera my mother had bought a few years back. 

I started to do my thing, took a LOT of really nasty pics of myself and after I'm finished, I transferred them to my laptop using the SD card in the camera. I put the camera back where I took it and went back to finish what I had started.

I forgot about it for a time until one day where my mom came to tell me she's going fishing with her boyfriend and she's taking the camera with her just in case they catch something big. I didn't think much of it until i asked myself something : I transferred the pics to my PC, but did I delete the pics from the camera after I put it back ?

I started panicking and kept asking myself if I deleted those pictures or not. At this point it's too late to call my mom back and ask her the camera for a few minutes so I can check and delete them just in case. I spent the entire day making up the worst scenarios I could think of, completely freaked out about it until my mom and her boyfriend came back from their fishing trip. I stayed in my room for about an hour, terrified to get out and face the possibility of my mom seeing her son's asscheeks spread in front of the family camera and 10~ other nasty pictures of all sorts.

After some time my mom came in my room, talked to me like nothing happened at all so I was completely relieved. I thought : ""Either I DID delete those pics or she did not see them yet"" but I still felt better anyways. After they both went to bed I went and checked the camera and there was no pictures of myself to find.

My relief only lasted for a while because the next day I overheard my mother and her boyfriend talking. All I heard of the discussion was ""You kept those pictures?!"" from my mom's BF. I immediately ran to my room, once again completely panicked. I had not imagined this possibility that my mother could have seen those pictures and deleted them without talking about it with me and pretended that nothing happened.

We're a few years later and i moved out of my mom's house and I'm still not sure I deleted those pictures. And I'm still wondering if they were talking about those pictures or not. My mom never brought it up if she saw them and I'm scared to ask her about it out of embarrassment.

t3_kqnoxy,TIFU by having too good acting skills as a kid,"This was many years ago and it's kind of fuzzy now but here goes.

I was at this summer camp and the councellors decided we would put on a play. It involved the wolf and the three pigs fable. But this play was unique because it was a play within a play. I was given the acting role of ""director"" in which my job was to randomly stop the play at intervals, shout at the characters about their lines, and change the scenery with a wave of my hand. Idk it was super weird but that's what it was.

They gave out notebooks with lines to everyone and it was our first read through. So I was getting to a part in the script where it was my turn to speak and ""be evil"". And so I went with it, insulting the wolf and three pigs, as per the script. I perhaps did it too convincingly. I remember getting death stares from the councellor watching backstage, and being confused because I was just reading my lines. She dragged me off the stage later and raged at me about manners and how I needed to control my temper. I was barred from participating in the play, and barred from participating in other camp activities afterwards.

I was a quiet kid and I was too freaked out by getting in trouble that I never admitted that I was actually just speaking lines the whole time, and that I had mistakenly read the script out loud from the wrong page, when everyone least expected it.

TLDR: Was in a play and was given a script. I mistakenly read my lines out loud from the wrong page. Convinced everyone I was talking for reals, and a total asshole. Got kicked out for being rude. Was too scared to admit I was actually just reading lines the entire time.",28,1,tifu
t3_kqnkxb,TIFU by driving my new (to me) car,"Background: I (15f) have been learning to drive (I have my learners permit), so my caring yet cheap dad decided to get me a car. I knew that he wasn‚Äôt going to get me a new car and I didn‚Äôt expect him to, but the car (2007 Honda Civic hybrid) he bought was in really rough condition. The main problem was that the transmission needed to be replaced. He finally finished replacing it this weekend. He got the license plate this afternoon, and I was thrilled because I would finally be able to drive it! The main reason I even needed a car was so I could drive it to my youth orchestra rehearsals. I usually drive my sister‚Äôs car, but she gets home from school later than I need to leave for rehearsal, so I am almost always late by just a few minutes. Now that I had my own car, I could leave earlier and I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry...or so I thought.


Fast forward to about 3:30 this afternoon. My dad and I are getting ready to leave (I still have to have an adult in the car with me when I drive because I only have my learners permit). Rehearsal starts at 4:45 and it takes about 40 minutes to get there, but traffic is usually pretty heavy so it takes longer. My dad originally wanted to leave around 3:45, but he needed to stop by the bank, so we left at 3:30. I start the car up and back up the driveway so that I can get to the road. The first thing I notice is the terrifying rumbling and shaking that occurs when I put the car in reverse. My dad said it was fine, so we went out onto the road. The next thing I noticed was how bumpy it was. Again, my dad blew it off and said that it was probably just a fixable problem with the tire. We finally got to the highway and I noticed ANOTHER problem. The car was really sluggish when you pushed the gas at first. My sister‚Äôs car accelerates very quickly, so it was a little concerning to think about since my sister has practically the same model of car. The reason it was so slow was because the battery wasn‚Äôt charging. I don‚Äôt know anything about how hybrid cars are supposed to work, but I do know that when you put on the break, it should charge at least a little bit. But the green bars on the gauge that show when the battery is charging did not light up and the gauge that showed the battery charge only had one little bar.


I kept driving while my dad, in the passenger seat, fumbled around with the different features. The biggest difference between my car and my sister‚Äôs car is that mine has a little touch screen navigation thing in the console. My dad really liked it and was trying to figure out how to use it when the screen turned off. He chocked it up to loose wiring and I could tell he was a little disappointed. A few minutes later, the lights on the air conditioning buttons, just below the navigation screen, shut off too. That‚Äôs when the real issues started arising. While going around a slight curve, I felt that the steering wheel was really difficult to turn. I decided not to worry about it though, because I still had a long way to go before I had to turn.


I came to a stop at a red light on the highway. There are several stores along the road. I pulled up a little bit as the person in front of me started to move, but when I looked down at the dash, the whole display was flickering. My dad told me to pull off at a gas station and I did, even though I struggled to turn the steering wheel. I switched places with him and he drove to an auto parts store just down the road. The car was lurching, the display was flickering, and it wouldn‚Äôt go over 5 mph. He was able to buy a new battery and replace it quickly. It was about 4:15 at this point and I was convinced that we wouldn‚Äôt make it in time. 


My dad drove the rest of the way (thankfully, as my legs were shaking really bad from the adrenaline), and miraculously, we made it on time! I‚Äôm so glad that we left early or else we would have been really late. As for the car, it still has lots of problems. There might be a problem with the axle and I think my dad said something about the alternator being the reason the battery wasn‚Äôt charging.


Sorry if this is written badly, I just thought it was funny how many things went wrong, yet I still made it on time.


TL;DR: I drove the car that my dad recently repaired to rehearsal, the battery died on the way, but I still got there on time somehow",14,2,tifu
t3_kqmxn1,"TIFU: No glove, no love","  Obligatory didn't happen today, but happened last Thursday on New Year's Eve. I drive a delivery truck and four days of the week I deliver in the St Joseph, Missouri metro area. I always see the same homeless guy standing at the last stoplight on my way out of town. When I saw him today I read his sign he was holding. It said, ""Homeless veteran, anything you can do will help."" He was wearing an old woodland camo Viet Nam era field jacket. I saw he wasn't wearing any gloves so in my rare fit of benevolence I thought I'd give him a pair of gloves since he was panhandling bare handed in freezing temperatures. I had a brand new pair of black Mechanix gloves I had just bought that morning and I had a nice pair of black Nike Fit running gloves. Both pairs were laying on my dash, so when the light turned green, I idled forward and wolf whistled for him to come up to my passenger window. As I rolled thru the intersection I tossed him a pair of my gloves out of the window which he caught and I went on my merry way. Feeling pretty proud of my self appointed do-gooder status. 
  Two hours later when I get back to my office I docked my truck to take the empty pallets out of my trailer. I grabbed my gloves and lo and behold I had two mismatched left handed gloves. I knew immediately where it all went south.

t3_kqmqaq,TIFU by not checking the name on my package,"So my wife and I recently decided to try a few new things to spice up our intimacy during COVID. I don't often buy lingerie for her, but when I do I usually get it from victoria's secret or a place that's near our house. Because of covid, I decided to try buying her a few items from Amazon instead. I went kind of crazy and purchased about 6 pieces of lingerie, a very realistic dildo, and a butt plug - I was ready for a great weekend.

I was sitting at my home office a few days later and got a notification that the delivery was a few stops away. It was pouring and I didn't want the package to get soaked, so I went to the door and greeted the delivery guy as he fumbled around a bunch of packages and handed me mine. I set the package on the table to dry while I finished up my work and few minutes later I got the a gut twisting text...

""Hey!  We're expecting a bunch of deliveries from Amazon today and accidentally opened one of yours that was accidentally delivered to us.  Sorry!""

I read this text that was between me, my wife, my neighbor, and his mother, and felt my heart drop. I quickly went to amazon to see if it could have possibly been a different package that was delivered to my neighbor, but no, the most intimate, private package that I have ever had sent to me was delivered to the wrong address...and of course, it was opened. It was the perfect storm.

I then went to check the package that I set on the table and realized that sure enough, it was addressed to my neighbor. Had I noticed this when the package was delivered, you wouldn't be reading this story. In an attempt to comfort myself, I thought ""well, maybe the lingerie inside the package just looks like clothes""...I had to do the awkward exchange to find out.

I dropped the package on my neighbors porch and responded to his text to let him know about the mix-up and he brought mine over shortly after. Luckily it was still raining, so there was a good excuse to not share any dialog other than ""sorry about that!"" I brought the package into the house and set the box on the dining room table and opened up the two flaps that had obviously been previously opened. The first thing I see is a massive penis looking dildo in a clear hard plastic tube. Right next to it, the stacked lingerie with a label on the top that read ""Schoolgirl lingerie set"". The butt plug was nestled in the corner, but it was easy enough to see.

Anyways, my neighbor and I have not spoken about this awkward occurrence, and I certainly don't plan to. Word of advice, if you ever buy lingerie or anything else that is private online, make sure the delivery driver delivers it to the right house if it's at all possible. Also, check your packages and make sure they're delivered to you!

TL;DR - Bought a bunch of sex stuff online, it got delivered to my neighbor by accident, and my neighbor opened it up and obviously saw inside my sick kinky mind.",1,0,tifu

We ended up watching a story about a couple living in a haunted house. The ghosts lived the walls, so there were all kinds of thuds, and scratching sounds, and whispers that developed into screams, and so on. 

It turned out to be a pretty decent horror movie and the buildup and graphics were amazing. Only problem is that it is now 1:15 at night and I can't sleep because suddenly all the normal sounds in my house are of course coming from the ghost.

She then goes to start a load of laundry, which I said she didn‚Äôt have to do, but she wanted to help out since I had been the one driving. She starts the washer, we make some pizza, and watch some tv. 

After a few episodes I got up to get a drink and she asks me to switch over the laundry, at which I jokingly let out a exasperated sigh and a drawn out ‚Äòfine.‚Äô I go to open the washer and paused when I looked inside. Everything was covered in these weird patches of white, and my first thought wasn‚Äôt pleasant. You know those white, strandy egg sacks you see in spider nests? Yeah, gross, and they were covering everything in the washer... But then I saw something else, a teal piece of plastic. Wtf? I pull it out and what do I find? The plastic wrapping for a pack of Angel Soft. The pack I had on the shelf above, with the remaining 1 or 2 rolls of toilet paper, had at some point fallen off the shelf and into the washing machine. Then my gf throws a load of clothes in on top of it without looking. So now all the clothes are covering in damp, half dissolved toilet paper and I break out in laughter. She‚Äôs embarrassed, I‚Äôm dying of laughter, and my washing machine looks like a Walmart toilet bowl.

There‚Äôs no way we were getting all that wet toilet paper off so we start throwing small portions of clothing in the dryer at a time hoping it‚Äôll all catch in the lint trap.

t3_kqklwj,TIFU by licking my orthodontist's hand,"Yes this happened today, and yes I am still hiding in my room afraid to face other humans. So, I have braces, and I had to get a surgery to fix an impacted tooth. Today I had to go back in to get my wires tightened, and to get another wire attached to yoink down this tooth that ended up trapped on my palate. Basically I have a chain connected to this tooth but it's still under the skin except for a teeny bit of chain.

So anyways, I sit down and she gets started, I pick out a new color and all that jazz. Well, my ortho gets to the area where I had my surgery and begins yanking to her heart's content. Good god, I was in agony. I'm not sure quite what she was doing, but boy it hurt like hell. Well anyways, after far too long of absolutely awful pain, she stops and turns to the plate of torture devices. I assumed that we were done, thank the lord, and out of instinct I went to feel with my tongue to see if the area felt different. (And to make sure that I still had all my teeth)

Here's where the fuck up happens. You see, my tongue is really long and pointy, so it looks kinda funny whenever I move it. Very similar to the Gene Simmons tongue. Anyways, I went to feel the spot and discover that there was something smooth covering it. Being a complete doofus, with my mind hazy from the awful pain, I continued licking whatever was there trying to make sense of the situation.  A few seconds go by and I see that my ortho has a very confused expression. It was her FINGERS! I had been licking her hand repeatedly for the past like 30 seconds. She definitely noticed. I had assumed that she had taken her hand out of my mouth to go mess with the tools, but I was wrong.

I instantly stopped and tried to mutter that I was sorry, but that's tough with a bunch of stuff going on in your mouth. ""We're almost done, just have to cut this piece of chain."" she said. I nearly died inside realizing that I was about to face more pain, and that I was going to have to look her in the eyes again. I still have 2 years of treatment left, fml.

t3_kqjyf1,TIFU by sending profesor 159 page long cheat sheet,"
today my unluckiness hit all time high. today i had a ancient history final, i was supposed to write a half page of text on 3 out of 80+ headers(subjects).
 i spent month learning for this test, i went throu every answer with internet and read a book which has everything i could be asked about. basicaly i had never spent more time to get ready for a single 45min task. while i was preparing i with my fellow students created a 159 page book with all the answers so if anything we can just quickly check answers and i saved this file under name Ancient History test, Name Surname. well 2 days before test i recived a message that during the time of final exam the home will be cut of from electricity (its covid time so everything has to be done from home) to manage that i created a whole setup so professor can see me and i can write and internet is working without eletricity and thus i had to use my laptop which i use so rearly after the lockdown i needed to use my other keyboard just to write. Anc then i had everything ready and they didnt cut the electricity so i was in position of having unfamiliar pc, unfamiliar e-mail (why outlook), and poorly named files. well today after writing the best work i could i realized i have 1 minutes left to send in the work and so i did send the professor, who is well known for hating cheaters with passion, a file named Ancient history test. name surname. but because the panick and my immense stupidity i sent him what one could call a cheat book. well now after he sent me message saying what he had recived i would like to say, dont be like me check the work at least twice because all the work and my credibility has gone, and yet i ,now empty husk of a man, will try to live with myself if i'm not thrown out of this university i had been working for since 5th grade.
TL:DR
i sent a professor 159 pages of cheat sheets and not my final exam work
P.s.
 (those pages were used in my fellow student work too so if professor checks i might have destroyed their work too as they said that they pasted and edited just a bit. Which would suck even more as i dont think i can handle ruining something for others with my dumb existance )

t3_kqju01,TIFU by giving my younger cousins weed brownies,"Obligatory this didn't happen today, but on on New Year's Eve (12/31). After taking a few days, I'm now able to look back on it with some humor.

On NYE, I decided to bake some weed brownies for myself with around half a cup of ABV that I had accumulated over the past few months. I'd just broken my Pax and was waiting for my Mighty to come in, so I figured why not use the ABV and start anew with 2021. I dumped the entire half cup into the brownie mix and was good to go. After baking, I had the ~~wonderful~~ idea to bring some over to the small family gathering at my aunt's house, where we were having an outdoorsy dinner. 

After arriving, I take out the small container of goods, and my cousins (15, 17, and 20) immediately ask about them. I tell them it's weed brownies, and their eyes lit *up*. At first, I was fully intending to just share some with the 20 year old cousin, but I thought to myself, ""Don't be a scrooge on NYE."" Since I started smoking at 15, I figured I was probably a hypocrite if I told them (15 yo and 17 yo) that they were too young to have any.

I smoke daily, and I low-key forget that tolerance is a concept. However, I figured that since I was using ABV spread across a 13x9"" pan of brownies, each brownie (cut in 1.5x1"" rectangles) would be like maybe 5-10 mg. Pretty easy shit, yeah. After finishing dinner at like 9 p.m., I cracked open the box and everyone took 1 brownie. I ate two, but was fairly sober so I could keep an eye out if anything did happen. 

Check up at around 10 pm on the 15yo in their room playing League. Everything's fine, and they're just feeling a ""full head,"" but other than that, completely normal. 17yo has passed out while watching Criminal Minds. 20yo is pretty much sober, as well, and we all decide to take a brief nap before waking up for the fireworks.

Wake up from the nap to hear my uncle knocking on 15yo's door. He comes down, asks what's wrong with 15yo since they're crying and won't answer any questions. I immediately sober the fuck up and run up to check on them. 15yo is curled up in bed, and my aunt is standing over them, worried. I manage to get everyone out and try to coach my cousin through their high, and it's going poorly. Their head feels like it's about to ""explode,"" and I'm terrified that they'll vomit or something else. Meanwhile, 17yo is pass the point of passed out and is nearly nonsensical. For two hours, I was running back and forth between the two, trying to see if 20yo was feeling any negative effects and checking if the parents are suspicious. 

At around 11:45, I manage to get the 15yo to wash their face and brush their teeth before tucking them in again after midnight. 17yo is now nauseous as fuck and can't get up without the room spinning. I'm panicking at this point and feeling like a sack of shit for causing this to happen. I'm at the point of seriously debating if I can carry 17yo to their bedroom on my back, but they sober up at the very last minute and wobble their way up. The whole time, I'm berating myself. The berating is not helpful in any way.

It's past midnight at this point. I check up again on 15yo (finally sleeping peacefully, thank fuck). 17yo, instead of washing their face and brushing their teeth, has decided to face-plant directly onto their bed, eschewing sheets and blankets and whatnot. That's fine, I can work with that. I wet a rag and wash their face in bed and also remove their chains so they don't wake up with marks on their neck.

Finally, it's over. 20yo and I look at each other, and they ask me to stay the night in case anything else happens. I make up an excuse to stay the night (too drunk to drive home) and stay up all night until 6 a.m. to monitor everyone in case they wake up disoriented and/or scared.

Morning comes. At breakfast, 20yo jokes that I should hand out my brownies at anti-drug school events. Everyone's fine. I go home and pass out at 12 p.m.

TL;DR: I give weed brownies to my younger cousins on NYE. They all have bad trips, and I spend the last moments of 2020 and the first hours of 2021 making sure no one woke up screaming.",58,9,tifu

t3_kqjf75,TIFU by sleeping naked on my couch.,"I am going to keep this short and sweet. This happened early this morning.

Backstory: Husband's BFF stays at our house every weekend. He 100% of the time opts to sleep in the living room opposed to the spare room. This man sleeps through *everything.* 

I've been a sleepwalker since I was a child. I've never been concerned about this because it's mild at best and makes for some funny finds in the morning. Most recently, I found an empty liter of cola in the glassware cabinet and one dresser drawer rummaged through. I have many sleepwalker stories, but that's not why we're here.

The Event: BFF passed out on our recliner around 9pm. Absolutely normal behavior for him. Husband and I watched an episode of Virgin River on Netflix and then went to our room for sleeps.

We did the dirty, I cleaned up and flopped into bed in my (quite skimpy) underwear. 

Fast forward to 1:30am. I wake up ON THE COUCH still in my underwear. I'm snuggled up with a baby blanket that is not doing me any favors. BFF is no longer on the chair; which means something disturbed his hibernation sleep. I hear the bathroom fan running so I dart to my bedroom (blankie in hand) and after a quick bout of shame and quilt I go back to sleep.

I told my husband first thing in the morning that I woke up in the middle of the night practically naked and somehow woke up BFF. He didn't seem phased by this.

NOBODY SAID ANYTHING while we were all getting ready to leave for work.

Husband and his BFF work together, so i'm interested in learning if he had said anything during the day.

This had worked fine for the last few months and my old neighbors knew about my work so they were fine with it but recently an older couple moved in and I didn‚Äôt get the chance to meet them and explain my situation. 

So last night I needed my sub to stay over so he slept out in my driveway (his choice) and my neighbors had seen him sleeping outside as they came home and saw him again in the morning.

On NYE, I smoked some weed in my car and didn't think much of it. The next morning, I wake up to text from my dad and he was furious. He smelt the car and found gummy stickers, a lighter, and a receipt from the dispensary totaling $1000. The most unfortunate part was that the receipts for all of the carts, weed, gummies, etc, wasn't mine, but under my name, because I have a medical marijuana card.

So far my dad hasn't laid any punishments or grounded me - mainly because I am going to leave for on-campus at the University on the 18th. It's been 3 days and the annoying part is that he constantly texts me about the situation. I want to get through to his head that it's just fucking weed and not heroin or something. Since he allows me to drink alcohol, I can't see why he can't look at weed the same as he looks at alcohol.

To be honest, I'm not sure what to do. I have two weeks to kill before I get the fuck outta here for good.

We discussed budget and messages and I arranged for some flowers to be delivered, saying that if the shop couldn't do same day delivery I'd ask my dad to drop them to grandma as he'd surely make an effort to visit her on her birthday (they both live alone and are in a bubble). My cousin mentioned something about it being out the way, which confused me slightly as it's not at all, but I assumed it's just because she hasn't visited in years and was a bit confused about where things were.

Cousin messaged me again this morning asking if I want the address, to which I thought ""of course not, I lived there for years!"" and assured her I knew the address.

  


Fast forward to this afternoon, grandma received the flowers and is overjoyed. She sent a photo of them to our family group chat and it made her day. She was so happy.

As I get into the utility room (near the side door), where we keep their food I spotted a slug in one of their bowls.

Well, COVID hit, and I figured that being in isolation with nothing much else to do is the best time to own a working hot tub. I tried to do the repair work myself, which took a lot of time and stress, and in the end I had to have a professional do it anyways. The process ended up costing almost $2000. But, with no vacations to budget for, we figured it was a good use of our money. 

And it was! We've been loving using the hot tub this winter. We regularly go out there for family time with our kids, who love being able to swim around a bit, and I regularly go out by myself at night to unwind. We have a beautiful park behind our yard that makes it an amazing spot to relax. Because of COVID I've been having long zoom calls with groups of friends, and realized I could do that from the comfort of my hot tub, which just amped up the enjoyment of both activities.

Concurrent to all of this though, my wife and I have been trying, unsuccessfully, to have another baby. The giant FU is that we didn't think, at any point, of the fact that hot tubs kill sperm. Last night as we were discussing our failures in the bedroom, it finally occurred to us that the hot tub might be a problem. I was disappointed, thinking ‚Äúshoot I guess there will be a few days every month when I can't use it.‚Äù

Nope. We looked it up and found out that after being boiled, it takes sperm three months to ""respawn"" or whatever they have to do. 

So until I produce a winner, I am no longer allowed in my own hot tub that I slaved (and splurged) so much to repair. It took us two years to get pregnant with our previous child. Hopefully this one comes sooner.

TL;DR fixed my hot tub, boiled my future children

t3_kqg0ib,TIFU by drinking boiling hot water and obliterating my taste buds.,"Well, typing this with fkn colgate in my mouth.
So it was a normal night, i was ready to go to bed and decided to take a sip of water (oh god why).
There was a normal water bottle and a thermos. It's really chilly where i live today so i decided to reach for the thermos and being fucking stupid, i didn't check the temperature of the water and just poured hot boiling liquid into my mouth and realised i have fucked up severely.
Immediately threw the water on my bedroom floor and screamed in agony after realising my taste buds have been fucked more than Constantinople was by the Ottomans.
There goes my taste buds for 2 weeks and begins the process of pain after everything i eat.

TL;DR : Drank boiling hot water from the thermos without checking the temperature and now i can't taste anything.",24,4,tifu
t3_kqfqrw,TIFU by sleeping before a zoom meeting,"So, as you all know, many of us have had to resort to the most terrible way of doing school ever, online school. Now, it may not be bad for everyone, but for me (15F) it sure is terrible. It drains me, keeps me up all night doing homework (which makes no sense because we are already at home, duh XD), and makes me just want to close my computer and sleep forever. Which leads me to my story! 

So, after the most restful 3 week winter break ever, I dreadfully logged onto my online school today. My first class was pretty easy, it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúHuman Growth and Development‚Äù. This class wasn‚Äôt terrible, as she just let us talk about our winter breaks and we only had to do one easy assignment. Next, I had Language Arts, which again, was honestly pretty easy because we were just taking notes. 

But, after that class was my 1 hour break. So, i decided to take a nap and set my alarm to wake up when I needed to get online again. (Bad idea). Well, knowing me, I SLEPT THROUGH THE ALARM and missed science class and half of geometry. Honestly, I hate these 2 classes. But I am known to be a pretty good student, and sleeping through online class is not something I have ever done before. Thankfully, I logged onto geometry halfway into the class. 


The even worse part is I had a dream of meeting my favorite celebrities. So, while skipping class, I had an amazing dream that wasn‚Äôt even real. Good going on my part smh. I hope that is the last time I ever sleep through class, and I still feel terrible about it, but I mean everyone makes mistakes and that was just probably one of the smaller mistakes of this world. Anyways, if you have gotten this far, thank you for reading and I hope you are having a lovely day :)


TL;DR - fell asleep before I logged onto science which is not normal for me, and even had an awesome dream which made me feel very confused and upset when i woke up.",17,5,tifu
t3_kqfp10,"TIFU by making a lady at Walgreens think I'm being abused, or am an addict","So backstory, I'm working (I'm in the VERY beginning) on my Masters of Nursing Science to become an NP, and my boyfriend is in PA school. I'm absolutely surrounded by medical people in every aspect of my life, and I sometimes forget the rest of the world doesnt operate in my bubble. 

Most people dont know this, but blood draws and starting IV lines are an art, not a science. So this means that practice practice practice is the most important thing. 

It's so easy to start a line on someone with body builder veins, that you could probably learn it from YouTube. But the reality is that most people dont have body builder veins. I, for instance, have itsy bitsy little shy veins that dont like to pop up with a tourniquet, and they also roll harder than a teenager at a rave. 

Thanks to Covid, all my classes are online, and I don't know about you all, but I don't think starting IVs can be learned/practiced online. I've never had the opportunity to start a line during my clinicals so far, and a pandemic fucked it all up, and my clinicals are online for now. 

But due to my lovely rolling veins, and my boyfriend having access to medical supplies, I decided to practice on friends and family... and myself. 

Well I fucking suck, and even though I always get a flash in the chamber and into the vein, I somehow always blow it when I do it on myself.

So I'm at Walgreens and I forget that massive bruises on the hands and wrists aren't normal to nonmedical people, and this lady asks me ""are you okay?"". I tried to explain how the bruises happened but I have social anxiety and made it sound even worse. I think she thought I was a heroine addict if I wasn't getting beat. She asked me if I'm safe and have friends and family I can call. The cashier and customers behind me were staring at me too, and I just crumbled embarrassingly and said I'm fine. I hate how I cant just act normal when strangers talk to me. My brain just shuts down. But she gave me a sad look and walked off. My cashier didnt even make eye contact with me. So great, I can never shop there again. 

So I guess.... just be patient with your nurses, especially the new ones. Because we've all had to get super inventive to learn how to be effective healthcare providers during a pandemic. 

Remember to wear a mask and stay safe :)

TL:DR a lady at Walgreens thought my bruises were either abuse or drug use. I'm a struggling nursing student trying to deal with learning during a pandemic",22,11,tifu

t3_kqey5l,TIFU by becoming a slapstick character over a measly $5,"Now that I finally had a little bit of physical cash in my pocket for the first time in a while, I decided to capitalize on a days-old hankering for McDonald's that I'd had. (Yes, I know my body is a dumpster. What of it?)

I ordered my meal, went to the first window, and tried to pay with exact change because of the national coin shortage. As I finally grab my coins in one hand, I give the cashier my dollar bills in the other, and while she grabbed the $1 with ease, the $5 slipped out of both of our hands.

I opened my door to grab it and made mistake #1: I slammed my car door against the brick wall. The bill was just out of reach, though, so then I made mistake #2: I leaned out of the car to grab it, **taking my foot off the brakes**. Now my car was moving forward with my leg still in it, simultaneously pulling me away from my cash and toward the car that was a few yards away at the second window.

So there I am, hopping on one foot to get back into my car before it crashes into another one and this $5 loss becomes a whole insurance thing. As I try to open my car more and slide back in, I continue to slam my door repeatedly against the brick wall, taking off chunks of paint each time. I get back into my own car a few feet before the it hits car in front of mine, then I make a quick third mistake by *immediately pressing on the gas* when I meant to press the brakes. Fortunately, I course correct before we actually collide, so no cars got damaged besides my own.

The first good news is that the van behind me in line saw this whole thing go down and did not pull forward, which would have just made things messier. As things stood, I put my car in reverse and shamefully backed up to the first window again, where the very concerned cashier watched on in horror. I fished out a second $5 bill and handed it to her, and for my troubles she gave me about a $1 discount on the whole meal because I was clearly having a bit of a day. Now, 30 minutes later, I'm finally sitting down to eat with one bloody knuckle, as I apparently punched the brick wall while trying to stop my car.

t3_kqevug,"TIFU by thinking ""dipshit"" wasn't a swear word.","This happened when I was 11.

My (much older, strict) sister was at my mom's. My nephew (9) stayed over with us.

We watched ""happy gilmore"" on VHS (appropriate, right?)

There's the scene where the guy is trying to throw Happy off his game and keeps calling him ""dip shit"".. naturally, I started saying it.

He quickly stopped me and said

 ""that's a bad word! I'll get in so much trouble, stop saying that!""

So I kindly explained to him that it's not a swear word because there's ""dip"" in front of it, so it's obviously a different word.

We watched the movie probably 3 more times that night, and kept calling each other ""dipshit"" or putting it at the end of every sentence the entire night.

The next morning, his mom is there when we wake up... She yells in my room

 ""boys, wake up""

We wake up, being young we were just naturally wide awake as soon as our eyes open.

We go out to the table for breakfast, his mom says 

""Good morning, sweetie.""

He replies in a very upbeat and loud 

""Good morning, dipshit!""

t3_kqeaem,TIFU by buying an f/4 camera lens as a brit,"To preface i'm a photographer who mostly uses a small pocket camera (Sony RX100) and a DSLR only for bigger jobs, i'm not a big fan of mirrorless.

Anyway, i was getting bored of using my RX100 and missed the large viewfinders, the battery life, and everything else that came with DSLR's, but my only DSLR was a Canon 1D IV which is way too big and heavy to carry around.

So my christmas gift to myself was the Canon 7D w/ EF 24-105 f/4L

I was a little skeptical of getting a lens with a maximum aperture of 4, my sony is 1.8, if you don't know what that means, f = l / D where l = focal length of lens and d = diameter of the front element of the lens, the lower the number, the more light the lens lets in.

But i realized i never really used f/1.8 on my RX100 unless it's really dark, i'm a pixel peeper with self-diagnosed OCD and the zeiss lens at 1.8 is a little soft, so i mostly used f/4-8.

So i opened the lens and camera on christmas day, the lens had some scuffs which knocked it down in value, the camera, some signs of use but very well looked after with low shutter count, both are fantastic.

The problem? I've been bringing the camera/lens out on essential days, but literally everyday it's been overcast and raining, and i'm forced to use a max aperture of f/4, the pictures either come out grainy due to high ISO or blurry, or underexposed, and i'm pretty sure i have some form of Seasonal affective disorder, which means i have no inspiration and have taken a few hundred photos, only a handful have actually been decent enough for my portfolio, the rest is blurry or just me testing it out.

I also overestimated the High ISO noise performance, my RX100 deals with noise fantastically and even then it's only nice monochromatic and there's still info in the shadows, the canon though, has horid chromatic noise, hot pixels and no info in the shadows.

On a bright sunny day it's a great combo, if i was one of those stereotypes living on the West Coast of the USA in Sunny CA, i'm sure i'd be getting some great pictures of my VW camper and the palm trees at the beach while cranking the vibrance up high for those cyan blue skies at shutter speeds of 1/2000 at f/8 with ISO 200.

But no, i'm a brit with typical british weather trying to get atleast a decent macro shot of a raindrop on a window at 1/30 of a second at ISO 12,800 hoping f/4 is good enough.

To make matters worse i bought myself a cheap ND filter set because i envisioned doing photography on a sunny day, they haven't seen a single bit of use yet.

I'm considering getting an EF 50mm f/1.8 STM 

TL;DR: I'm a photographer who was bored of shooting with a pocket camera so i bought a decent used DSLR and F/4 lens as my christmas gift, only to find out it doesn't let in enough light for overcast rainy british days, i have barely used it, and i'm considering buying a nifty fifty 1.8 or going back to using my pocket camera",4,5,tifu
t3_kqea15,TIFU By Almost Burning My House Down,"The original fuckup was not today, but it took a while to come to a head, so hold onto your hats. On the upside, this is not sex related!

I bought a house earlier this year, which I am very proud of. Along with that has come lessons in homeownership, like the one I just learned.

I'd been out of town for the weekend, and paid my brother to watch my dogs for me. He brought them back around 10 pm, we chatted for a few minutes, and he departed. I went back to my room to watch the latest episode of Mandolorian.

Around 10:30 or so, the power in the bedroom suddenly went out. It's an older house and a lot of the downstairs is on the same circuit, so I figured I'd just overloaded it somehow, which has happened several times. I went to check the breaker box and turn the power back on.

The following is what happened to the best recollection of my stressed memory:

I tried to flip the breaker, but the lights didn't turn back on. The breaker also didn't want to stay on. I heard what sounded like a weird popping noise though, and wondered if an animal has gotten into the wiring and chewed through something/electrocuted itself. I went in the direction of the sound, and started to smell a little smoke. Thought this confirmed the animal theory. I then walked into the next room, and it was **full** of smoke. I turned around to run back and turn all the breakers off, when I saw a light coming from under the door of my utility closet. Full of dread, I checked the doorknob for heat, then opened the door.

My utility closet was on fire. 

I flew back around the corner, turned off every single breaker, and began running around looking for a bucket while calling 911 (US emergency number). I remembered I had a bucket sitting right outside the front door from where I'd dispatched and disposed of a snake recently, so I grabbed it, filled it full of water, and threw said water into the closet while holding the phone to my ear with my shoulder and maneuvering around two dogs who had no idea what was going on except that mom was running in circles, things smelled weird, and this was great fun. The 911 operator informed me that I should not attempt to put it out myself and should instead get myself and my animals out of the house, but the first bucket had put about half of it out, so I promptly ignored her and threw another bucket onto it because I'll be damned if I was going to let my new pride and joy burn down if I could do something about it while the fire was still relatively small. Satisfied that it appeared to be out, at least on the surface, I hauled the animals outside to wait for the fire department.

Fortunately the fire station is not far from my house, and they rolled up within a few minutes. They confirmed the fire was in fact fully out and not still smoldering somewhere, were properly sympathetic, then commenced an investigation. I was standing outside discussing dogs with one of them when the fire chief came outside and summoned me to come look at something.

I walked inside, and he held up a small gasoline (petrol) can. 

...

While doing yardwork over the summer, I had been leaving most of the equipment - *including the gas can* \- sitting in the front room. This shares a wall with the utility closet. The operative theory of the fire department is that when my brother brought the dogs back, one of them knocked over the gas can, which still had some gas in it. The gas rolled out of the can, along the floor, under the wall, and down into the utility closet (which while accessed from the first floor, extends into the crawlspace). When the water heater next kicked on, it ignited the fumes from the gas, which traveled to the gas itself, then to the wood beams it was on...you get the picture. Thankfully it burned through the wiring early on, and while I was still awake.

I got a shaming lecture from the fire chief about bringing gasoline into the house, even to keep it out of the rain, and how I needed to just get a small storage shed to put those things in. I did not shamefully admit to the fact that I already have a storage shed, and just forgot to put the gasoline in it like an idiot because it's on the other side of the yard.

I then slept on a blanket pallet in the dining room for the next few days because it and the kitchen were the only rooms that still had electricity, and also I was paranoid and afraid to be too far away from the utility closet in case it spontaneously combusted. 

For what it's worth, the dogs also thought floor camping was great.

Tl;dr: Left gasoline in my house like an idiot, someone knocked it over, fumes caught fire, almost didn't have a house anymore.",38,9,tifu

Little background:

This happened on Saturday, not today.

English is my 2nd language, please respect.

My dad works in a car shop. It is quite small with only a few employees so repairing your car on weekends/holidays is normal. My dad also isn't very mobile, he walks with crutches and probably will for the rest of his life. He also can drive very well and isn't a slow driver by any means. He doesn't drive like a pshychopath, just a bit faster than other normal drivers around. I (M18) recently got my license and I drive not like my father, but still kinda fast, not that much tho. As I want learn to drive nicely as fast as possible, I drive when I can. I also have some small skill in car repairin, specially from watching YT. Now to the fuck up...

I(M18) was trying to change faucet in a very badly accessible place in our bathroom. As it was unaccessible with side spanner, I needed deep socket. Sadly we don't have any at home, so me and my dad went at his work place (car shop) to borrow some tools. When I started to drive I felt some weird feeling in front tires, they were like if they weren't round. I immediately stopped and went to look at it. It was completely flat. I reversed back in parking place and went for a compressor to the boot. When the tire was full I waited for a minute to check if it was possible to even get somewhere and it was so we headed out.

When we arrived at dads work it was still kinda full, but anyway we started to investigate. My dad found a screw stuck in the tire, at very sharp angle. I jacked up the car, broke bolts on the wheel loose and unscrew them with impact driver. We were able to fix the tire with the help of my knowledge from internet and a video I recommended (from Chrisfix). It was already very dark when the tire was ready to be put back on the car and I parked outside the shop, as there wasn't room inside. **And there is where the fuck up started...** I put the wheel on the hub, and because I had a few problems with putting a wheel on a car right in the past, I wasn't really sure what I was doing. I grabbed a bolt and put the wheel on the hub, found a place, where the bolt screwed into and thought it was alright. Threaded all the other bolt through the wheel to the hub by hand and then used impact driver to tightened them. I then checked if they were tightened well with torque wrench. I tightened them at 130 Nm, lowered the car, filled the tire with air and it was done. We headed home. On the way when parking i felt like the wheel is doing weird noises, but thought it's just normal stuff, as basically last thing I heard was an empty wheel.

Today, when my dad drove to work, he heard the same thing. On the way to his work he stopped several times and felt that there was some gap between the wheel and the hub with his nail. This gap wasn't at any other wheel, just on the one I put on. After second stop the car was really hard to control, so he stopped and saw, that 3 of 5 bolts were missing. He called his coleague who came and helped him put the wheel well on. It ended well, but just the thought that I could have been the one, who was responsible for his crash is a bad thought. There are several video on YT of people driving with only three wheels, but image you are going more than 100 km/h and suddenly one of your wheels just flies away... BTW the tire is still alright and not flat, so that is at least something good i guess.

TL;DR Found a flat tire on my dad's car, repaired it, put wheel back on the car wrong, and the wheel nearly came loose while my dad drove to the work.",2,2,tifu
t3_kqcmmj,TIFU by trying to ring in the New Year with some bubbly,"Didn‚Äôt happen today but the after effects have been ongoing until now... 

Being a particularly glum end of a very sad holiday season in 2020, I decided I would get some moderately priced champagne and celebrate it right! The clock struck 12 and I had the bottle ready as my plan was to get drunk and binge Netflix all morning until I fell asleep to the sun coming up. Usually it‚Äôs not very hard to remove the cork; I can typically just yank it off without much effort but this one was a bit stubborn. I used an overpriced pampered chef champagne cork remover thing I purchased and maybe only had the opportunity to use twice hoping to get a better grip on the thing. The device has scary looking metal teeth on a handle that only succeeded in ripping off the top of the cork, so I was left with a broken cork and nothing to drink to bring in the New Year. 

I was VERY determined to keep to my plan so I Googled different ways you were supposed to open the bottle now - used an icing/hot water trick, the shoe thing, pushing it down to get it loose - but nothing seemed to get the thing to budge! It says specifically NOT to use a corkscrew but I thought, ‚Äúwhat the heck‚Äù I‚Äôll just be sure to keep it pointed well away from my face or anything breakable in my kitchen. I managed to get the screw portion in a few turns and pulled with all my strength!! This only resulted in me pulling off the top of the corkscrew, which fell into the sink and broke one of my favorite mugs. So now I had an unopened bottle, a broken corkscrew, a broken mug, and an ever growing obsession to get this bottle open and save the rest of my evening. 

Another less preferred method, because booze and sharp objects do not mix, is to use a small flat knife to try and wedge it between the cork and the bottle. This only led to pieces of the cork crumbling off and making it even more difficult to pull the thing out. So I just go for it and start jamming the knife in there in an attempt to push the cork into the bottle. I give myself a good wind up and proceed to jab the knife directly into the knuckle of my thumb and the pain and blood pooling out of my finger is instantaneous and massive. I run into the bathroom trying to find some first aid materials and turn my sink into an episode of ‚ÄúForensic Files‚Äù while I splash alcohol and wrap the thing with paper towels. After the bleeding stops and I‚Äôve found something I can use as a bandage (I put a scrap of paper towel on the cut with some bacitracin and secured it with an anti-snoring nose strip), I return to the bottle (it‚Äôs about 2:45am now). At this point, I am angry and wounded and NEED a win to start my 2021. I do finally succeed in pushing the rest of that fucker in the bottle and ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù a cork filled flat glass of bubbly before calling it a night at around 3:30am. 

Later that evening, I decide to venture out for some proper first aid supplies and drive about a block or so to CVS. I load up on junk food, bandaids, and gauze and head back home. It started to ice but I wasn‚Äôt worried, I only live a few minutes away. The road was a bit slippery and I hit a pothole a little too quickly and pop my front tire. I had to work the following day (Saturday) so I get up early, find a local service station and beg them to put on my donut so I can get to work. Thankfully my luck is shifting by this point and I get to work with 5 minutes to spare and arrange to get a new tire installed before the shop closes at 5pm. So all told, it cost me about $180 in damages and a still aching finger to have that one terrible glass of champagne on New Years. Here‚Äôs to 2021, friends!! 

Tl;dr: In an attempt to get drunk on New Years Eve/Day, I break a ton of shit, stab myself, and get a flat tire trying to go for first aid supplies in an ice storm.",37,6,tifu

Anyway it was already 2 am and everyones already sleeping while i am alone in my room, it wouldnt hurt to beat my dick off to some really good hentai that i was specifically saving for this very event but unfortunately, there was no internet. Luckily i had this app with videos and files i downloaded from the internet so surely there must be some leftover porn in it. I found this one video of a woman just showing her ass and teasing the viewers (if thats the term for it). I completely forgot about that video before so it felt like seeing it like its my first time. Holy shit it was really fucking hot dude like there was no music so you can hear her moaning, breathing n shi, it felt like she was close to me (god im lonely). Suddenly there was this part where she slaps her ass, i suddenly got a really weird feeling and got really fucking horny but i wanna make it hotter because its new year so it needs to be special. I went to this video editing app, literally edited parts of the video to be louder, repeated, zoomed in, all that shit because i was literally that horny and desperate. Theres a problem tho, i cant go out or they might find out, the only lube is the backup menthol shampoo in my cabinet, it will give a spicy sensation but i had to risk it.

Yeah that wasnt a good idea, i watched like the entire video while doing a literally doing a bop-it combo attack on my dick, it felt refreshing during the moment until i fucking came dude.

I had menthol shampoo as lube a few times before, i could handle it but the problem is that it was a special day. I was doing it for like a long time nonstop with combos and i was watching a really cute video made hotter with my editing which means it was extra painful and i fucking came for around 10 seconds. IT WAS LIKE 10 SECONDS OF GIVING BIRTH THROUGH MY DICK!!1! anyways i drank alot of water for refreshment but i was stupid, i had to pee which means i gotta go through that pain again. That went on for like 3 hours but it was slowly fading.

TL;DR i used my video editing skills to make the porn vid i watched hotter and used menthol shampoo causing me to feel pain as if i was giving birth even though im a guy.",8,17,tifu
t3_kqai13,TIFU by getting into an accident in a work vehicle for my brand new job.,"I recently started a brand new job in a field that I never ever thought I would go into. It‚Äôs hard work but pays very well and there are tons of perks like a company truck, phone, etc. The only bad part about it is how terrible I am. I‚Äôve only been there a month and training is a lot of me figuring it out on my own which always leads to me screwing something up. Mind you this is not my dream job, just something to pay the bills for now.

Well, I was driving to work this morning and got off on the exit where our office is located. I let the truck in front of me go forward, look both ways, press on the gas and BAM. I slam into the back of this guys new 2021 Toyota Tundra. We pull off on the the side in a motel parking lot and I call my managers (who think I‚Äôm dumb as shit already) and proceed to tell them how I hit someone with a company vehicle. To make matters worse, as we‚Äôre waiting on the cop, the other driver comes out and tells me that he had bought the vehicle yesterday and it had less than 100 miles on it. 

When I get to the office, I arrive to a bunch of shaking heads and sucking teeth which, at this point I‚Äôm used to. There was undoubtedly a ton of paper work and even more guilt. 

TL;DR I suck at my new job, everyone thinks I‚Äôm stupid and I fuel that perception by hitting someone with a company vehicle",14,8,tifu
t3_kqa4d8,TIFU by thinking someone would give away skins for free and having my account stolen,"
Two days ago, I couldn‚Äôt sleep, so I watched some Tiktoks on my phone and saw someone giving away cs:go skins on steam for free. I thought I‚Äôd give it a try and typed in the given link, leading to something that looked like Steam. I tried signing up, it went as usual, I verified my account on chrome. At least I thought so. As soon as I was done, I was logged off my own Steam account, someone changed e-mail, password and deleted my phone number. I tried recovering it, giving the support all necessary information to verify it‚Äôs my account. While waiting, I had a closer look at the website that looked like Steam. Someone faked it, even the address wasn‚Äôt real (he managed to cut away everything that made it obvious so that it looks exactly like the real page). Checking my mails more carefully, I noticed I didn‚Äôt verify me logging in earlier, but some russian guy. Luckily, Steam sent me his IP so I was able to DDos him with the help of my best friend. After 24 hours, the support gave me back my account.

TL;DR: I gave away account information, hoping to get free stuff, my account got stolen, I had to search proof it‚Äôs mine to get it back

Covid testing at a big rec center lot, need to be tested to return to work. Tried to do this last week before the holiday and was turned away because the lot was full. So today I showed up 45min early, full tank of gas, assuming for some turnout- it is pure insanity. Longest line of cars I've ever seen. Looks like I'm trying to enter a festival.

The way we're positioned in line prevents me from backing out and leaving. There's no way to even have others back up and let me out because were too close to each other and snowbanks have made the area too narrow for a 3 point turn. No bathroom/portable toilet in sight. I'm starting to get the urge to pee as well. I can't figure out a creative way to get out of this. Will post updates in the comments section.

t3_kq9jni,TIFU By thinking I could fix my kitchendrain myself.,"So I live in my apartment for about 1,5 years. The drain in my kitchen never went smooth.   
But it was manageable, I just had to wait for a couple of minutes, so no worries. 

Today I was cleaning my apartment and when I wanted to pour away all the dirty water. I found out that my drain didn't flow at all. So I thought this could be an easy fix. So I used a plunger to get the water to drain. Unfortunately this didn't work. I went to the store to get me some drain cleaner chemicals and poured it in. I Let it rest for about 2 hours (1 hour longer than needed, following the box) .

So I read online that most of the times the problem situates in the siphon. So I get myself a bucket, and I'm ready to unscrew the siphon. All the water gushes out, including the drain chemicals. Nothing to see in the siphon, so I thought it was fixed. I tried to put it all together again. Fortunately I manage to get it all to fit again. I let the water flow to see if it's fixed, but after the siphon is filled the water stays in the sink and won't drain at all.   
So I take it all apart again and I tried to pick in to the pipes in the wall with some iron wire. I feel something and I start to push against it with some force. I get through something and suddenly there flows a tsunami of dirty sink water out of the pipe, all over the cupboard and floor. Wet and smelly as fuck I think the problem is solved so I put the siphon back together. But I did something wrong and I hear something break. So I look at it and there is like a massive crack in one of the pipes. 

Now I'm here sitting here fully defeated, all wet and smelly. Waiting for the real plumber to come and help me out of my misery.

t3_kq982b,TIFU by accidentally spilling a chocolate milk drink on a kid at my high school and running away,"Clarification: this happened six years ago when I was still in high school. It was a time where I was a loner and I always ate alone in the school cafeteria. The lunch break of my school lasted for an hour. Back then, I also had a busted watch and to make things worse phones weren‚Äôt allowed in my school.  

I did my routine of eating lunch and studying at the same time. As I wasn‚Äôt keeping track of time, I didn‚Äôt realize that 50 minutes had passed and I only found out when i asked a nearby acquaintance what time it was. I panicked as I had a test which was scheduled to happen after lunch. On my way back to the classroom, I decided to buy a chocolate milk drink and to quench my thirst. After I paid for it, I realized that I had less than 5 minutes. I panicked and ended up spilling the drink on a grade schooler who was walking by. My school had a high school and grade school. Their lunch time tended to start as our lunch time ended.

As I felt the drink leave the cup, I looked and saw that the grade schooler‚Äôs white polo shirt was now brown from the drink. I was so embarrassed that I ran away. Unfortunately, the kid wasn‚Äôt given an apology which I still regret. On the other hand, I got back to the classroom in the nick of time and took the test

Out of curiosity I looked her up on Facebook and saved a screenshot of her profile photo to my phone‚Äôs ‚Äúhidden‚Äù album. 

Well today we were looking through photos of some trips I had taken in the last year and the screenshot I‚Äôd saved of his now-ex popped up. I didn‚Äôt know what to say except that I was curious what she looked like and was jealous of her being with him at the time. He joked that I had been stalking her. I apologized and just said how embarrassed I was. He said he didn‚Äôt care, but I haven‚Äôt been able to shake this feeling of shame and embarrassment‚Äîevery time I think about it I cringe. 

I guess we all make mistakes, but I can‚Äôt stop beating myself up about the fact that I felt the need to look her up and how stupid it was to not delete the photo after I‚Äôd looked at it. I hope he doesn‚Äôt judge me too harshly for this.

t3_kq8hz4,TIFU by texting a guy,"Few weeks back, I had been chatting with a guy on a dating app. The conversation was interesting enough to suggest texting to set up a time we could meet. He sent me his number. 
Around 9pm I texted, what I thought, was his number. I couldn't copy and paste from the app because it would copy the entire message not just the number. So I  clicked on the conversation in the app...went to my texts, started a new convo and entered the number. I have a bad memory, as we'll see.

I went to bed around 10 pm. Around 10:30 I get a call from an unknown number...I ignore it. But then I see I had missed a call from this number a few minutes before. Phone starts ringing again and I answer it thinking something must be wrong.
It's a girl and she says ""Is this kelly?"" No....she hangs up.
She calls back and asks who I am. I'm super confused and she says her boyfriend got a text from my number and who the hell am I. I look at my texts and sure enough, it's the number she's calling from. Problem is the last digit isn't the right number to the guy I tried to text.
Now I'm realizing she saw a text from a number on her boyfriends phone that's says ""Do you want to the and get together?""
I'm sure her mind is jumping to the conclusion that he's fucking around behind her back.

I started apologizing profusely,  I assured her I did not know her boyfriend,  I meant to send that to someone else,  I tried to stick up for this poor guy who didn't ask for this drama, I told her not to blame him, and I was really sorry for my error. I don't know who kelly is, maybe some girl she was suspicious of and she wanted to try and catch him.
Went to bed hoping I hadn't split up a happy couple by making her think he was cheating.

t3_kq7bm1,TIFU by constantly shouting rape in a foreign country,"Obligatory didn't happen today, but it's one of those fck ups I always have to chuckle about when thinking about it.

So about 2 years ago I lived a few months in a city in the mountains of Vietnam. I've made some local friends my age (one of whom is called Hi·ªáp) and we had lots of fun spending time together. Now they have this thing in their culture, where they really don't want to embarrass someone else by e.g. pointing out a mistake they are making.

Another important thing to keep in mind is that in Vietnam, depending on your voice the meaning of a word can change. And it can change dramatically. Since it's not the same for my mother tongue, I didn't really give it too much attantion.

I think you can imagine where this is going.

So in one of the last weeks I spent there, some friends tried to tell me in a really polite way, that I might want to watch how I pronounce my friends name ""Hi·ªáp"", because I always spell it ""Hi·∫øp"" (go find the difference...) and that basically means rape in Vietnamese.... When they told me I didn't know if I should be embarrassed or laugh, but the only thing that went through my head were all the moments I called my friend. In the supermarket, in restaurants, bars, with his family, etc.... I CONSTANTLY SHOUTED RAPE in public and no one felt the need to correct me until the very last moment. I appreciate their politeness and I still wonder what other people thought about me when they heared me calling my friend.

I was never really sure if they trolled me or not, but I finally looked it up and apparently they didn't.

t3_kq4dlw,TIFU By cleaning out my ears with only cotton swabs for 20 years.,"This actually unfolded over the last week, and am still ""enjoying"" the results of my actions..

So for the last few years I've regularly had an itch in my ears. Over the past few months it came as far as having an almost daily itch and I had to clean my ears multiple times a week because of the ginormous amount of ear wax my ears were producing. 

I had been searching for a long time to find an alternative for cotton swabs as I am aware they're not the best but wasn't able to find any (guess I'm an idiot..)

Last week the itching became so bad I started googling again knowing doctors will not be an option for at least 6 more months in my country due to COVID. And so I found an ear spray that is supposed to help dissolve your ear wax while keeping your ears moisturized. Sounds perfect!

I ordered the spray and as soon as it arrived I started going to town. At first the itch immediately subsided. Then.. It became much - and I mean much! worse. Also, any time I'd move my jaw I'd hear a scratchy noise inside my ear...

Finally fed up I took out a cotton swab and was shocked as I pulled out a huge piece of dead skin from my ear. As in.. I didn't even know the inner ear had that much skin surface.. it's like I'm a badly shedding lizard in my ear. Every day I'm pulling out huge pieces of dead skin from my ears and it doesn't seem to stop anytime soon..

So yeah.. gonna enjoy that for a while.. At least my hearing has improved since using the spray.. No more cotton swabs for me..

Tl;dr: Used cotton swabs for years, itchy ears caused me to try out a spray against ear wax. Turns out my ears were itchy from years and years of dead skin buildup. Now my ears are even more itchy from all the dead skin getting unstuck in my ears.

Edit. To all the people asking me in the comments for the product. Check your local pharmacy, they probably have similar products there and will be able to inform you. Best of luck and healthy ear cleaning to y'all!",3369,636,tifu
t3_kq4bka,TIFU by Watching Porn: when I should have been sexting my bf,"
Disclaimer: new to reddit, please excuse formatting and other newbie mistakes.

I (20F) and my bf(21M) had just spent the evening getting dinner and having a wonderful night together. Went for food, went shopping, played a game together, all that jazz.  Usually we like to get a little bit physical, but there were other people in the house so obviously that was off the table. Before he went home he mentioned us sending some risky things later that night when he got home. 

Now before I get to that, let me reiterate the statement that I am new to reddit and the world of amazing things in this app. Recently, I discovered that they have whole ACCOUNTS dedicated to NSFW stuff- fascinating!! I have never in my life watched porn, (something super intimidating about pornhub) so I was a little bit weirded out, yet I decided to explore and marvel at the fact that people post that kind of stuff on here. Anyway, my bf and I are very open with each other: I tell him everything. So earlier in the evening I casually mentioned me finding some interesting stuff on reddit, and he began to ask what kind, what I found, what subreddits, etc.... he got kind of excited because he knew that porn was very new to me and was intrigued at me exploring. That made me feel pretty good! Anyways that was pretty much the end of our convo about it. That is, until he got home.

We started to text and he asked me more about my reddit discoveries (getting on the sexy topics- yall know how it goes), and I perhaps foolishly? Told him what I had been looking at, and we talked about me finding something a little more my speed being new to porn- all the crazy stuff was a little much for me. I was then on the hunt for something a little more vanilla. So I started to look at just pictures, and then just dick pics. He seemed interested yet mentioned about being a little insecure, but we joked about some funny weird stuff that I found on there. He then started sending me pics of himself- which of course I loved, but I thought we were still on the reddit topic, so i continued my search to find my niche that I thought he wanted me to find. 

Well my stupid brain of mine was so distracted in trying to accomplish the goal of finding stuff, that I completely negated the fact that he wanted virtual sexy time with me. So a few of his pics later, he asked me why I was taking so long to respond, to which I said something to the effect of ‚Äúon reddit looking at dicks that aren‚Äôt yours‚Äù...... not such a great look huh?

He then got very quiet and very upset- to which I completely understand. I immediately realized that I had fucked up... big time. All because I thought HE thought it was hot that I was watching porn. *facepalm*... because it TOTALLY makes sense to basically ignore your SO‚Äôs pics to look at other‚Äôs pics so that your SO will think that‚Äôs hot.... like what????? So here I was, with a now SUPER insecure boyfriend, a reddit search history no one could be proud of,  and my incredible ability to create this situation itself. I swear I really am so stupid sometimes. In the moment I really thought ‚Äúoh yea he‚Äôs gonna love that I‚Äôm doing this‚Äù and MEANWHILE I‚Äôm ignoring HIS pictures?!!!!! Oh my god I could die right now. How could I be so ignorant? All because I was trying to do something I thought he would like. Clearly I need to re-evaluate my life choices when it comes to this stuff. I‚Äôve stayed away from porn my whole life- and I‚Äôm starting to think that it was all for a reason.

Thanks for reading and please be nice in the comments:)

Oh and PS: my bf and I talked it all out and it is now a joke between us. I pull stupid and idiotic stuff between us a lot and this is one big old cannonball in his arsenal of my situational belly flops. I am so lucky to have him and that he was able to see my ignorance and realize that it was all just a misunderstanding and not something more. I think I took the whole ordeal harder than he did lol!


Edit: since I‚Äôm new to reddit I didn‚Äôt really understand what the TL:DR was for, or what to put for it. Let me rewrite it.

TL;DR:  My new discovery of Reddit Porn led to me ignoring my boyfriends sexts. When he asked what was up I said something along the lines of ‚Äúlooking at dicks that aren‚Äôt yours‚Äù",125,28,tifu

The convo was a little awkward and they then FaceTimed me. I had to do something first so i said I would call them back. About a half an hour later, i called them back and we caught up on what happened in the past few months. I basically told them my entire life story as of 8 month earlier. They caught me up on their stuff and said that they became a witch. I have no problem with witchy things and I let them give me a tarot reading. I asked the deck weather or not my crush like me back. I honestly didn‚Äôt think that she did but I figured that I‚Äôd humour myself. She pulled a card and had to look it up, the deck said yes. Im an atheist so i figured it was a pure coincidence. I asked my friend if she wanted to see the person that I had a crush on, and they did. So I went to my crushes insta and screen shotted her latest post. I went to go message my friend the picture but I accidentally sent my crushes insta post to my crush. Not immediately noticing this, I asked my friend what they thought and they did see it. I looked and saw my crushed name right at the top of my phone. I was now in sheer panic, and i ask my friend what to do. They said to say oops. so I did. I then said ‚Äúfuck it, i might as well tell her to truth.‚Äù So I sent her a short message explaining that I had a crush on her and that i was telling my friend about her. I also apologised for being weird and I hung up with my friend so I could try to FaceTime my crush. She didn‚Äôt answer, I was getting increasingly more anxious and I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I barely got any sleep that night and I woke up in the morning to nothing. I called her again, and still nothing. So I texted her a few more times before she responded with ‚ÄúI thought we were just friends‚Äù Naturally I wanted to make sure she wouldn‚Äôt abandon me, and she assured me she was still my friend. I am still single, but that took some confidence to not lie. 

TL;DR - I accidentally sent a pic of my crush to my crush instead of my other friend and I decided to be honest about my feelings. She didn‚Äôt share those feeling with me.

t3_kq3eg0,Tifu by trying to get my boyfriend a birthday gift,"(Sorry if formatting is weird, I'm on mobile)

Wow, so this just happened. I'm amazed at how stupid I really just was. Just wow. I have common sense a lot,  just not when I'm shopping at late hours.

So there are these ads that come up all the time saying that you can get a specific ""over stocked"" item for free just by filling out a few quick surveys! Well this item happened to be exactly what I'm getting my boyfriend for his birthday. I can't say what it is in this post because my boyfriend follows me, but the item is worth $300. So I thought, 'Sure why not try this?"" 

When you click on the link it's one of those where you need to complete a number of deals in order to get the big reward. I think a total of nine. The deals are things like: you have to download a game and get to level three, or you need to sign up for a free trial. 

I only got through about four when I thought ""wow I should cancel the subscriptions as I go, so that I don't forget and end up getting charged a bunch of money."" As I go back to the website it notifies me that the subscriptions need to be active for 72 hours in order for it to be valid. Well shit.

At this point I decide that it would be way too much work to go back and redo all of the subscriptions and that I'd rather just buy the item instead of going through the hassle. When I go to cancel the last subscription, it says I have to call in order to cancel. While trying to look for other options I see that what I have a free trial to is a $40 subscription. What?! Okay, so now I'm hoping that I can just call tomorrow  to cancel and it will all be fine. The reason I'm most worried is because I can't find the website from doing a simple google search which leads me to believe it might not be a real website. 

Tl;dr I saw that the thing I wanted to get my boyfriend would be free if I filled out some surveys, ended up possibly getting roped into paying $40",3,4,tifu
t3_kq3bv9,Tifu By not confessing that this dude's fianc√®e in college would participate in frequent group sex with our athletic team after meeting him face to face.,"This happened in college some time back and I had no, fucking, idea... I creeped on her after a memory came up on FB of our last new years together in school. They have kids and have now been married for 5 years. 

We'll refer to her as Liz.

Liz was a part of the woman's sports team at my college. She got around a bit through my team and eventually formed a truple with another teammate and me. We'd all see other people but for the most part we would go home together.

My friend and I later found out she was engaged and had been for almost a year. I met her BF while her and I were sitting tables for our athletic volunteer hours. They dated for 4 years or so prior.

She did have a ring but switched fingers frequently since her fingers would swell from some condition. It wasn't flashy or anything, so we all just thought it was a family heirloom or something. 

Her fiance came up to the tables joking and then he hugged and kissed her. My eyes went up but I didn't want to say anything. I really didn't know what to say... Like, ""aye man, my dude and I gangbanged your fianc√®e"". Why would he believe me over her? Thinking back now I could have shown him her pics but it all happened so quick and I was so shocked.

After I met him I hoped and prayed that something would happen so that he found out about everyone she's been sleeping with on the side. But there is no happy ending to this story.

I bring this up because they look so damn happy and he was so fucking clueless when he came up to me at the table. It legit hurt my heart knowing that she could be so, idk what to call it...

People really can just look someone dead in the eye, tell them they love them, then go have a full on secret gangbang. I just, never want to date. Trust issues from that situation really fucked me up.

How can you even tell when someone is genuine? It's like a legit leap of faith.

Tl;dr: teammate and I would have regular group sex with someone on the woman's athletic team not knowing that she was engaged. Found out by meeting him face to while we all were sitting tables, he didn't know and didn't find out from what I can tell. They're married now with multiple kids.

t3_kq32fl,TIFU by placing the helmet on the fuel tank instead of wearing it on my head while driving a bike,"So I was casually roaming and wandering the streets of the city where I live, enjoying the ambience and architecture of the city buildings, malls, villas and houses and feeling the glory of city lights during the night (I roam this way whenever I get bored).

I was wearing the helmet while I was driving on the main road and took it out and put it on the fuel tank whenever I entered a lane or a street. It was a few minutes before the incident I switched from the main road to the street that leads to my home. The street was empty with all the stores closed and the helmet was on the fuel tank guarded in between my hands holding the bike handle. I was about to make a left turn into a lane at the end of which I will reach my home. Since there were no people around I decided not to decelerate the bike and make the turn. And when I was tilting the bike handle towards left to make the turn the helmet was blocking the tilt and I was unable to make enough tilt to make the turn. With the slight tilt and the excess speed, the bike along with me got bumped into a wall across the street. I was left with few few injuries and bruises. The bottom-line is that do not put anything on the fuel tank while driving a bike.

TL;DR - Placed the helmet on the fuel tank while driving a bike and met with an accident.",0,7,tifu
t3_kq2t0e,TIFU by not turning on a light while making a sandwich,"So, this literally happened about 40 minutes ago. I went upstairs to the kitchen to grab some food, but it was 12:30 am my time and other people are in the house, so I didn't really want to turn on a light (even though no one would have seen it, but whatever). I decided to heat up some pulled pork leftovers from yesterday, and while it was heating up I went to the dark pantry and grabbed some bread. I pulled the meat out of the microwave, made a few sandwiches and went ahead and ate one of them while watching a YouTube video. Then I picked up my phone to make a comment on Reddit and accidentally flashed it onto my plate and saw a horrifying sight-the bread was green. I accidentally found some super old bread in the pantry, and since I hadn't turned a light on, I hadn't even realized anything was wrong with this bread. I only noticed this after eating an ENTIRE sandwich on that bread. I immediately threw the other two sandwiches away and went to the sink, and very nearly vomited. I have no clue how dangerous eating that much moldy bread is, but it was sure as hell extremely gross, and I'm suddenly not very hungry anymore.

I decided to change things up from the usual, and because I am too broke to buy a sex toy, I decided to do some research and make my own. After about 15 minutes of trying to find the best one, I made one consisting of a towel, a cup, a rubber glove, and a few rubber bands. I built the masterpiece, found something good, and let it rip. I did the deed and continued on with my day. About fifteen minutes later, I am taking a piss, and I notice my thing is still red at the top, as if I just finished. I touched it, and immediately recoiled in pain. I finished using the toilet and sat in my bed. Another 15 minutes pass, and I decide to get a snack. I get up and immediately feel pain from down there. I look and it is red as a cherry tomato, and whenever anything touches it, it feels I have been stabbed by a knife. It hurts so badly. I lay back down and can‚Äôt move, and finally find peace when I take off all of my clothes. I go to my computer to try to find what could have caused this, and as it turns out, I am most likely allergic to latex.

t3_kq26w1,TIFU by almost destroying a microwave and giving myself food poisoning.,"Oh boy here we go on a ride on my peak of stupidity last year.

So a little bit of background: im 16 and have been living with my girlfriend K's (15 we're both female) parents since everything went to hell and due to personal reasons not to be shared on this sub but i can definitely say I've loved it here K learned how to cook from her mom and i gotta say they make some of the best food I've ever tasted. (important for later) and since i workout with K and her dad (more often K since it's a hobby we share in the garage) im known to have a very big appetite.



This happened roughly august of last year and one day i went to the fridge to go grab a container of what's left of the curry from a few nights ago that I've been snacking on for the past few days and i was excited to get more of that delicious food down my mouth so i can go cuddle with K while having all that food digest.



And here comes the FU. So i put in the container (that wasn't a clear one) into the microwave and put the timer on for about 2 minutes or so which was a bad idea considering there was a decent amount of food left but i wanted the food as quickly as i thought i could get it done so after two minutes i go to the microwave take out the container open the lid and low and behold there was a spoon just chilling in the center of the food. 



I silently mutter (well fuck) quickly went to google for a moment and found out it was harmless in some scenarios which i just breathed a sigh of relief I went to go get a bite and already knew that the food tasted kinda chilly but i thought to myself ""hey I've eaten soup cold before what's the worst that could happen?"" and ate the ENTIRE container and thought nothing of it however at about 8 am i wake up needing to go to the bathroom because my stomach was killing me. 



K woke up a few hours later wondering where i went and heard me groaning on the other side of the door and asked me ""you alright in there OP?"" i tell her that my stomachs been in pain i felt nauseous and felt like a lowish grade fever kicked in 


K paused for a moment and said ""that sounds like food poisoning..What did you eat?"" i mentioned about the curry last night and she burst out in hysterical laughter telling me ""OP you should never really eat ANYTHING cold that comes out of the microwave"" 

K's mom was at the store and asked her to pick up some meds for me to help things settle down so im not in any pain throughout the day 


K just brought this back up so now im writing this red with embarrassment.

t3_kq1tcv,TIFU by using losing my tampon inside myself [NSFW],"CW: tampon use üòÖ

Anyone who uses tampons can guess where this  is going. This was actually only an hour ago. I‚Äôm near the end of my period cycle and use tampons. I was feeling pretty horny and was ready to get down by my hot self, when I realized I still had a tampon in. I went to my bathroom to remove the tampon, pulled on the string and.... only the string came out. 

Ok, annoying but no big deal, I thought. This has happened before. I reach inside and feel the rouge tampon but can‚Äôt get a grip on it to pull it out.  I google how to remove a lost tampon and get moving on many different positions that are supposed to allow movement such as a squat, lying down, and having one leg up on a table. I still can‚Äôt get it out. 

The website suggests using lube so I lube myself up, when I realize it might help if there‚Äôs some natural lube inside, too. I get busy and get myself off with a toy, which does make it more slippery in there. I still can‚Äôt get it out and start to panic a bit. I call my doctor office and leave a message explaining what happened and that I need to see a doctor tomorrow morning ASAP to have it removed before I get toxic shock syndrome or an infection. I try to forget about it...

An hour later I get back to trying again. This time I‚Äôm thinking how can people possibly give birth if I can‚Äôt even remove a small tampon? I figure out a way to get multiple fingers inside and around my bits to mimic a clamp or something that might be used for birthing. I try many different relax and tense patterns before I FINALLY have a grip on the tampon, and am able to deliver it like a newborn baby. No more being vacuumed up into my organs for you! I am relieved until I realize the doctor‚Äôs receptionist is going to call me back tomorrow morning ...

TLDR: tampon string broke, left a voice message with doctor saying I needed help right away, basically gave birth to tampon, awaiting doctors call back tomorrow.",29,12,tifu

In order to save myself the embarrassment of leaving my room with an erection, I pulled up a gay porn video on my computer because that was the only surefire way to get rid of it. Unfortunately, I spent so much time worrying about leaving my room with an erection that I completely forgot to lock my door, and my mom walked in on me watching gay porn while I held my erect penis (in order to feel the erection diminish in real time). Now, not only has my mom seen my erect penis, she also thinks I‚Äôm gay and no matter how many times I tell her the real reason I was watching gay porn she refuses to believe me.

t3_kq06mw,TIFU by clogging the toilet and ruining thanksgiving,"Throwaway account for reasons that will soon be obvious. Just thinking about this makes me want to wither away like a humiliated house plant that hasn‚Äôt been watered in a year. On mobile, sorry in advance, yadda yadda.

For context, at the time of this story I was 17. I‚Äôm a half-asian female of average height and build. I say this because no one expects me to have, ahem, *issues* with the toilet. You see, I have problems with staying hydrated and such, so my bowel movements are usually hard. Also, I don‚Äôt go no 2 more often than once every two or so days, so my bowel movements are on the bigger side.

This has caused me to have issues with flushing my business down the toilet. Going at home has a 75% chance of clogging in every house I‚Äôve lived in. I never go at other people‚Äôs houses, which can be problematic. I usually love going in public restrooms because of the high powered flush (I‚Äôm getting one of those toilets one day, I swear), but I‚Äôve even clogged a couple of those.

Anyway, this story takes place in a little southern United States town. My parents, my brother, one of my sisters, and I were visiting family for Thanksgiving in this little town. We rented a mobile home to stay in while we were there.

Thanksgiving comes and everyone is at our mobile home. While we ate, I felt the need to use the bathroom. I could tell I‚Äôd need to go no 2 and panicked. In the mobile home, there were two bathrooms: one for us kids and another for our parents in the master bedroom. I was near the master bedroom and didn‚Äôt want to walk all the way across the house to use the one for the kids, so I just snuck into the master bathroom and did the deed as quickly as I could.

When I was done, I very hesitantly pulled the lever down to flush. The toilet growled and struggled and, to my dismay, didn‚Äôt flush all the way. I waited and tried again. And again. And again. Nothing. I panicked and washed my hands quickly before leaving like nothing happened.

I forgot about it after a while until a few hours later when we were all sitting around chatting. My dad disappeared into the master bedroom only to come out a few moments later announcing ‚ÄúThe toilet is clogged! Who clogged it??‚Äù in the loudest tone I had ever heard him yell. My dad is usually soft spoken so I have no idea why he felt the need to shout like he did.

Everyone looked at each other while denying any involvement with the clogged toilet as I felt all blood drain from my face. I couldn‚Äôt do anything other than try to look busy on my phone. Eventually, my brother piped up, ‚ÄúI saw op go into the bathroom earlier!‚Äù 

I didn‚Äôt know whether to strangle him or to lie down and let the earth reclaim me.

‚ÄúOp, did you do this?‚Äù my dad demanded. I sputtered in embarrassment.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to! I thought it went down!‚Äù A lie.

‚ÄúWell, now the toilet‚Äôs clogged and nothing will go down,‚Äù my dad grumbled, visibly pissed off. I heard snickers all around the room and I my embarassment only grew.

We decided to let it sit for a while longer so the turd could ‚Äòdisentegrate‚Äô or something. Hours passed and my dad went back to check on it. Nope. The turd was having none of it and refused to oblige, despite my silent pleas.

‚ÄúTHE TOILET IS STILL CLOGGED!‚Äù my dad thundered across the room, alerting everyone in a five mile radius that his daughter had, in fact, dropped a massive turd that couldn‚Äôt be flushed.

By now, the snickers had returned with snide comments about me and my bowel issues. My dad searched the mobile home for a plunger, but  we had no such luck. ‚ÄúWe might have to call the owners,‚Äù my dad said to everyone, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to explain this.‚Äù

The giggles had turned into all out laughing at me when my family heard this. I tried laughing with them, at first, but my humiliation began to overpower me and I started to sob. My insecure teenage ego was torn apart all at once. This only made my family laugh harder for whatever reason. But when my tears didn‚Äôt stop, they tried to comfort me while holding back their giggling.

All of their efforts to comfort me were undone when my mom stepped into the master bedroom for the first time since I had used it. Anyone with a Filipino mother will know how they are with bad smells. Her nostrils flared, her face scrunched up, and she exclaimed, ‚ÄúOH I CAN SMELL IT FROM HERE. OH IT‚ÄôS SO BAD.‚Äù Then she made that sound where you cough and had gag at the same time. My siblings burst back into laughter and I had had enough. I went to bed holding back tears.

The next day I sulked, hardly leaving my room. The owner came and did what he could to make the toilet flush. Still nothing. This, of course, made everyone laugh all over again. My mom complained loudly. More laughs. I felt really awful. The smell did permeate and made eating kind of hard.

We ended up leaving the mobile home with the toilet STILL clogged. We never were able to fix it. My family brings it up ove once in a while and still lose their minds over it. And, after all these years, I still feel utterly humiliated. My mom and dad did apologize to me later saying that they did overreact, but the damage is done.

TL;DR: clogged the toilet in a small rental home and stunk the place up. We never could unclog it. It ruined thanksgiving.",43,24,tifu
t3_kpzlc2,TIFU by accidentally mailing Porn to my parents for Christmas,"Obviously this happened over Christmas, but I just learned the extent of my mistake today so here I am.

My mom (Mother) and my dad (Father) raised me and my siblings in a pretty religious household. We went to church everyday and comparatively had a strict upbringing. However, as part of that up bringing Mother never wanted sex or sexuality to be this weird, mysterious thing. So she always went out of her way to educate us and make sure that we understood what sex was, the pros and cons, and all of that. So while we were a religious family, sex was not a terribly taboo subject.

As such sex was often something we would talk about and joke about, especially as we started getting older and married. That is the set up for my mistake.

A few weeks ago I called Mother and asked what she wanted for Christmas, historically I would give my parents a bunch of gift cards to various restaurants, but money is a bit tighter this year so I couldn't provide my usual gifts. When I asked her what she wanted it was ""Just a simple gift ward would be lovely, or a book that Father and I could read together.""

So I sent them a little gift card to Texas Road house and a book: [365 Sex Positions](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1646040333/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1). I thought it was funny. My package came with a little note of ""Date night is one me. One gift is for Father one is for Mother. I'll let you decide which is which""

Ha. I'm hilarious.

They opened it Christmas year in front of my two siblings who were still at home and I got all the reactions I wanted (supposedly, I was at the in-laws this Christmas). 

Well, on a call today with Mother, she told me that the book I had sent her was *graphic*. Like live models posing the positions and close camera shots graphic. See I was thinking it would be outlines or drawings, not Paul and Amy getting freaky in the sheets.

So I sent my \~60 year old, religious mother a book of 365 graphic sex photos. I'm not sure if that counts as pornography in most households but it certainly does in mine. Whoops.

Don't ask why or how I got to that conclusion since nothing in that situation even remotely gave that hint, but I went for it at which point, as I'm just about to close my mouth, he moves his hand back trying to figure out what the hell was just about to happen and, at the same time, I realize that the reason he had his thumb there was to show me that the girls was dancing to the music and now, since they decide in that very second to pay attention to anything around them, I have both of them asking why I was about to bite dad's thumb and he hasn't stopped making jokes since.

My dad work as a contractor, in his younger years he used to bring my mom on the road, and my mom used to pack some lunch for them to eat on the road, including a milky white thermos filled with hot coffee, nothing special, just some instant coffee, but he loved it.

Once upon, when they were on the road, they decided to take a break from the long drive, to have lunch, and maybe drink some of the coffee. They found a nice spot to park, under the shadow of a big tree, with a small creek with clear water nearby. My father parked his car, a personally modified Toyota FJ-40, he replaced its engine from a 3-speed gasoline engine, to 5-speed diesel engine he bought, it used to belong to small truck. It was a lovely car.

They washed their hands, sat on the front of the car, and took out the lunch. 3 boxes, one box full of rice, another filled with stir fried vegetables, and the last one  for meatballs and eggs. They put the lunch on a flat top cover of a self-made toolbox, it was located in a small gap in the middle, in between the front grill of the car and the bumper. The car was equipped with a flat bumper, so you can sit on top of it. Else, you could also eat standing by placing your dish on top of the flat surface of the front mudguard. It was a very lovely lunch, a nice tradition they enjoyed away from us kids.

After finishing their meal, my mom poured the coffee from the thermos to its cup, the first pour to her husband, as always. Then she took another cup, and poured one for herself. At that moment, right before she drank the coffee, one single cockroach floated up to the top of her coffee, dead, of course, most likely from the hot water.

From that point on, we brought portable stove and a jug of water on every trip. If you want coffee, you boil the water then and there. My father didn't trust that thermos anymore. He taught us that lesson.

While I was sitting on the john scrolling reddit and taking care of business, the toilet flushed underneath me by itself (it‚Äôs motion-sensored). Some water splashed up at me which was disgusting, so I lifted up and let it flush. Again, the same thing happened a minute later. After that flush, it flushed two more times consecutively. I lifted my body up to see what was going on, and found that the toilet was clogged and filled to the BRIM OF THE SEAT. 

I freaked out and stood up, and from there it flushed again causing my business to flow out of it and all over the floor.

t3_kpwjl8,"TIFU by offending my ""New family""","**A little bit of ""pre-story""**

So a couple of years ago my parents got divorced and not too long ago I got to meet my dads ""new family"" meaning his soon-to-be wife and her 3 children. All 3 of them are my age (late teens) or older.

So we planned to go to this waterpark and stay there for 3 days, just so we can get to know each other.

My dad is an extreme meat eater, he cannot stand eating salads or anything green on it's own, he always has got to eat meat next to it; he also cannot stand vegetarians and always makes sure to point it out.

""Sarah"" is one of my stepsisters.

**To the main story:**

So, I get picked up by my dad, we drive to the waterpark and arrive at the summerhouse that we have rented for 3 days, where I meet his new family (my stepmom, 4 stepsisters, and one of their boyfriends). They are quite possibly some of the most awkward people in the world and have absolutely no sense of humor. So after standing in the summerhouse and awkwardly chit-chatting, we decide to go out and get something to eat.

When we arrive at the restaurant (you guessed it) the mood is extremely awkward. So my dad starts talking, and starts talking about the steak he has just gotten and how great it is. Because the table is so silent, I try to get my dad to start some conversation, since he is the only person at the table who actually doesn't look like a statue; I then slide in a comment about my chicken wings and state that *""I could never stand being a vegetarian""* because I love chicken. My dad giggles a little bit, the same way that he always does when he is about to to sh\*ttalk vegetarians. (I expected my dad to pick up on my comment, since he always sh\*ttalks vegetarians). He turns to me, nods, and quietly (only I could hear it) says that *he thinks vegetarians are dumb people*, I answer with *""Well, a little strange, but not exactly dumb. But that's just because I can't imagine being a vegetarian.""*

After a couple of seconds of silence, he slowly turns to me and loudly says *""Oh, you can just ask (Lets call her Sarah) about being a vegetarian, since you think they are strange, she's a vegetarian...""* Suddenly my dad and the 5 other people at the table are staring at me in silence. I then nervously and blurt out *""Well, you're a vegetarian, that's totally understandable, atleast you're not a vegan, cause that is really weird""* In a horrible attempt to lighten the mood.

""*Uhh, I'm not vegetarian... I am a vegan...*"" she replies, and the table becomes dead silent; she becomes extremely angry and leaves. We half an hour later find out that she drove home and refused to come back to the waterpark... the 3 remaining days, his family just stares at me as if I'm some sort of monster who called ""Sarah"" a dumbass or something; they barely even talked to me... It's safe to say that I won't be seeing much of his new family.

Last time I saw the family was a couple of weeks ago, this thing happened many months ago; and they still carry a grudge...

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR; My dad who always rants about vegetarians, kinda ""baited"" me into starting a rant about vegetarians in front of my step-family who I just met. He tells me to ask ""Sarah"" about how life is as a vegetarian. I respond with *""Well, you're a vegetarian, that's totally understandable, atleast you're not a vegan, cause that is really weird.""* in an attempt to lighten the awkward mood at the table. She then corrects me and says she actually is a vegan; she becomes so offended that she drives home from the waterpark and refuses to come back. Now my entire stepfamily seems to hate me.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 1:

It seems that someone got offended by this, since they decided to PM me. To clarify I don't have anything against vegetarians or vegans, to be honest I couldn't care less about what people put in their mouth. It was just something that I said, because I kind of was panicking since I hate silences, and got kind of ""desperate"" for someone to actually talk. So no, I am not a ""Vegephobe"" or whatever you want to call it.",15,20,tifu
t3_kpwjdi,TIFU Having my dog die and missing out in potentially one of my most important meetings of the year.,"So to pre-face this happened December 30th 2020, which was just the cherry on top this shitty year needed. Another important detail, my dog (being an old lady in her prime of beauty) has been having internal bleeding for a few years now.

I'm currently a film student and trying to get into a good film school, so one of my best friends got their cousin who is apparently very connected to set a day with me and shed some wisdom to how the industry works, what to study and focus on, all that fun stuff. 

I have prepared a week prior to that day a reel, 2 shorts, a list of questions, and even my college application reel. Hell, I even got a haircut! To say I was esctatic is an understatement. 

Day of the meeting is set for 2pm. I wake up at 9am, cook breakfast and everything is set. Out of nowhere, my dog is bleeding. A lot. My family we clean her blood usually as it's a little bit amd we always tell her it's okay and it's not her fault, bless her since she always gets nervous when it happened. But this time was too much blood, so we call a vet and drive an hour away. It's okay, we can get there and get back in time, I'll shower for the meeting. Easy? Wrong. The doctor refuses all surgeries for the next few days due to new years. We take my dog and drive over to a more expensive vet. I definitely cannot afford the surgery and neither could my brother but fuck it because we love her. It's another long drive and the whole time I'm playing her favorite songs including Miss American Pie. We get to the vet, fill out the papers and wait. At this moment we are only 2 miles away from my house so once she goes under for surgery I can head home. 

I can't explain why but the doctors take fucking forever. I keep being beside my dog petting her with my brother. It's 1:20pm. I tell him I'm going to stay a little while longer. The doctor comes in and gives us the talk about the procedure. I ask the doctor ""She is going to make it and come home"" they assured me this is a procedure done many times and to not worry. I kiss her forhead and tell her I'll see her home. It's 1:40pm and I can't take the car as I can't drive. To my horror uber is backed up and I'm wearing flip flops. I ask my brother for his shoes which are 1 1/2 sizes smaller and without socks and just start running.

Running in khaki pants, polo shirt, and tight shoes was a challenge but I must make it to that meeting. I finally arrive home, my computer is off. I turn it on, I join the zoom link (worst case I lie and say my camera doesn't work) and then wait. I look at the time, it's 2:07. I notice an email from the person I'm supposed to be meeting, they've been waiting for me before 2 and said I must always be early and that by 5 minutes they left. Shortly after reading this I find out my dog didn't make the surgery. 

It fucking sucks, I wasn't there for my dog's final moments and I didn't even make it to the meeting. I wish I had emailed to post-poned it or have done things differently. I also wish I never left my dog's side. 

Now I'm left with missing my dog, and blistered/cut feet which is still healing. What a way to end a shitty year.

TLDR: My dog bled and in the vet was okay. Couldn't drive so ran home to meet someone who was supposed to guide me for the future. Dog died and I missed the meeting. I miss my dog.",11,10,tifu

So, this week I rescued a box of ugly fruit and veg. For those who don‚Äôt have ugly boxes, these are the fruit and veg that are perfectly edible but just look a little strange. In this box of ugly fruit were some pears. I know some people hate them, but I love pears! They have such a subtle flavour and taste really sweet when ripe. 

Anyway, the pears I rescued the other day aren‚Äôt ripe yet, which is perfect because I‚Äôm currently fasting, but they‚Äôll be ready to eat when it‚Äôs time for me to break my fast. (I understand that some people don‚Äôt agree with fasting but it works for me) I‚Äôm not physically hungry, but psychologically the idea of food is sounding great, and I‚Äôm getting so psyched thinking about how great these pears are going to taste. 

In my emotional high of delicious pear infused thoughts, I added a line on my Instagram that was essentially ‚ÄúI ‚ù§Ô∏è pears üçê ‚Äú 

Now whilst I internet, I‚Äôm not 100% up with all the lingo and who‚Äôs cancelled etc. which should be obvious as my sister just called me, informing me that I might want to take it down as it was essentially espousing my agreement with paedophilia??? Because the pear emoji is now a symbol of ‚Äúpro expression, anti- reaction‚Äù nonces or some other such stupidity. I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS 

So now I‚Äôm contemplating making a post saying something like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt agree with paedophiles, just really excited about fruit‚Äù or something similarly ridiculous in case people think I‚Äôm in support of child molesters

TLDR: rescued some ugly fruit, got excited about eating it, made a post about loving pears, found out it looked like I was supporting paedophiles

t3_kpvqk4,TIFU by giving out to an autistic child at work,"
Happened a number of years back at a music shop where I worked.

Was behind the counter and a 13/14 year old and his grandmother came up to the counter. I was in my early 20s and had no knowledge of autism or how it impacts peoples behaviour 

He asked something like

'Do you have Fallout 3' in a very aggressive manner 

I replied with
'On which console?'

He fires back with even more anger
'DO YOU HAVE FALLOUT 3?'

I was a  bit annoyed now and asked again
'On which console?'

He comes back again and goes
'DO YOU HAVE FALLOUT 3!?'

I was pissed now and go
'Please don't talk to me like that, it's very rude. If you can be more polite, I'll be happy to help'

The boy doesn't take any notice of what I say but the granny interjects now and goes
'How dare you speak to him like that, he has autism' and they storm off.

I caught eye contact with another customer and they gave me a half sympathy/half you  fucking donkey kind of look.

I still randomly think about it at 3am and it makes me  cringe a lot

TLDR
Gave out to an autistic kid because I was too dumb to realise he had autism and thought he was being rude instead",14,30,tifu

so I'm sitting at my desk, playing with said lockpicks, and have the frightfully spiffing idea to test how long it will take me to remove the lock from my toe.

FU no.1

I placed the lock around my big toe and set out to start picking it, its all going well and it should be off in no time, oh how wrong could i be? Remember how i mentioned that they were flimsy lockpicks? it snapped. Inside the lock. On my toe.Oh, no problem, i think to myself, i'll just get the key.

FU no.2

So i probably should of checked where the key was beforehand, but as i was so confident in my skills as a locksmith, I assured myself i would not need it, so i placed it somewhere that i don't know.

t3_kpvais,TIFU by eating a pot gummy contaminated in the dumbest way possible.,"Actually happened today.   


Backstory: A few months ago we had an issue with someone bringing laundry to our house for washing, knowing full well they were infested with bed bugs. We ended up treating the issue with a high heat option, where the house was heated up to 140 degrees and killed all the bugs and eggs. We were given a list of precautions to take and things to remove from the area before the heat was applied (think aerosols, candles, fire extinguishers, ammunition). 

Funnily enough, the precautions didn't include the removal of my infrequently accessed weed drawer, which contained a ten pack of gummies.  Fuck up #1. 

We found the issue several months later, and couldn't figure out what had happened because it had been awhile since the heat treatment and it wasn't at the front of our minds. We did eventually figure it out, and decided the gummy was still good, it was just going to be a more ""choose your own adventure"" thing where we guessed at how big a bit we wanted and hacked it off. 

Anyways, I asked my husband earlier if he would get the out gummy and chop me off a bit. He kindly obliged, and asked, ""What do you think this stuff is on the outside?""

I looked. ""Looks like crystallized sugar."" Shrug.

""Huh. maybe it's trichromes.""

Good enough. I popped it in my mouth and started to work it over. It had an odd texture which I wasn't surprised at, but it took me a minute more to figure out there was something INSIDE the gummy. I worked it out and showed it to my husband. ""Hon, was there a paper wrapper on those ones?""

He looks at it. ""I don't think so? That's really weird. What....?"" He trails off. ""I know what that was. That was a Silica Packet.""

It was. I fucked up by eating the silica packet packaged with my weed. Now I get to have dry mouth twice. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Our weed gummies got melted and hid from view a silica packet that I accidentally ingested. Never fear, I should be alright. The issue with those packets is more of a choking hazard than poisoning.",13,2,tifu
t3_kpv2go,TIFU by pointing out to my friend (F) that her date might* be gay," My friend went on a date today and about an hour shared his pic with me. Lo and behold! Turns out, I know this guy. Not only are we acquainted but I think he might be gay. We have met a couple of times in various events and I once overheard him saying how being gay is really not accepted where he is from and ""it's difficult for us"". From his words, it seemed that he is gay (or bi). However, we aren't close enough for me to ask him this directly.

I told my friend about this and we spend about an hour with her recollecting the date and seeing if there were any signs. It does seem like she has a crush on this guy and the thought of this guy being gay was surely disappointing for her.

Worst thing, she can't even really ask him this directly right at the beginning and she doesn't want to make up a story to get it out of him. Neither does she want to go on for like 5-7 dates and then find out.

Quite a tough spot she has gotten into. If he isn't gay, then my bad for giving her a couple of sleepless nights. If he is, well, that's a while different can of worms.

TL;DR Told my friend that her date might be gay. She is disappointed.",2,15,tifu

So this story starts off with me getting back from the gym with my father. At this time I'm heavily into training and working out, so any kid at my age would try to stuff as much food in there mouth as possible, because eat big, get big right. So when I get back from the gym I made a protein shake with 3 cups of milk, 4 bananas, scope of whey and a hand full of almonds. So to any rational person that's to much food, but to a ego driven teen it was hardcore and cool. So later in the evening my dad said we have to walk the dog. So I get ready and I start walking the dog with my dad, but I also have the huge urge to throw up. Half way through the walk I can't handle the sickness so bend over and start throwing up off the sidewalk into a patch of tall grass. (Side note my dog is attached to a retractable leash). Then my runs under my nose and yeah I bet you know the rest. My dad ended calling stupid and a moron after I told him about what I consumed around 45 minutes earlier. I learned 2 things that day. Don't over stuff your self to the point of sickness and don't use retractable leash. TL;DR made a protein shake with to many ingredients. Went to walk the dog. Threw up on the dog.

She shows me her hand and there's a little bit of blood on it. No biggie, she's recently come off her period, she runs to the bathroom. I start cleaning up and feel a bit... sore. I look down and see a bit of blood and notice that my banjo string has snapped. 

I've heard stories before how people don't notice and that it heals itself and all and all its not too bad. However, I start to feel a bit sick, light headed, worlds going dark, i stumble throug the house, almost tripping over a bag in the room bang on the bathroom door to be let in to vom.

I've always prided myself in being level headed , giving others respect and listening to them. So I'm very disappointed in myself.

I was at a party the alcohol was flowing and we some how got into a conversation about poverty and choices. I was explaining from my point of view that people in poverty don't have many choices. He disagreed and that's fine. The conversation started to feel personal. I should had excited but I didn't. My friend brought up the company I worked for. The guy I was chatting to laughed at me. I tried to defend my position and explain why I've made some of the life style choices I've made. I don't know why but something just flipped inside of me I walked out and slammed the door. My friend was not best pleased and said if I did not calm down I'd have to leave. I later apologised but I feel like I've messed up big time. I feel like I should had excited the conversation earlier I should had been more aware of myself....Whelp guess I will have to live with this embarrassment.

Generally I do these one at a time, so the process goes &gt; print label &gt; put urn with paw print in fancy bag &gt; call owner to let them know remains are ready &gt; make note on label that owner had been contacted. I had two this day and left a message for the first owner to let them know their pet had returned, and got the second label ready for the next one. When I was getting things ready, the first owner called and said she would be by soon to pickup, so I took the label off and made a note. I can‚Äôt remember exactly what happened but SOMEHOW when I put the label back on I attached it to the wrong pet. I‚Äôm normally much more careful but for some reason this day I missed it.

What happeded was that my mom, my dad, and my grandma were watching football and I was on my phone browsing reddit in a furry subreddit on my phone. I came across a YouTube video that have a compilations of furry memes. I accidentally closed the app and I went to resume it by clicking the YouTube notification with out reading it. It turns out that it was asking to share it to another device. I bet all of you can guess what device it sent the video to. I am surprised that I didn't get a heart attack the moment ""Furry meme V5"" showed up on the TV. I started to panic when my grandma started to read the memes as them came up (the post was marked NSFW so I was scared of what could show up) until I decided to restart my phone which stoped the streaming.
Now I am pretty sure they all know that I am a furry now. 

This alone would realy be a much of a fuck up  however, I am more worried about how my dad and grandma will react. My dad is a very politically conservative so the fact that his son is a furry might not go over very well. For my grandma, I am not worried about what she thinks of me as much as what she might say to others. She tends to talk nonstop and I can easy see she speaks to other family members about me being a furry.

TL;DR I streamed furry memes to the TV they my family was watching and kniw they all know I am a furry.

I still don‚Äôt understand what she thought while she did this but actually she was talking shit about me while my buddy who I mentioned earlier was in the car with her lol (they both were getting a ride from a friend from a party).

So I (F19) was talking to my boyfriend (M19) on Instagram and he told me that he's home alone without any food. He lives pretty far from my place So I decided to order a burger for him. He asked me to drop the idea but I wanted to do something nice for him. I insisted he let me order his dinner. At first, he said no but then after some time, I convinced him. So I ordered him a burger and some chicken wings. I put his phone number so the delivery guy can call him directly once he's there. After 35 minutes the delivery guy called my boyfriend and told him he arrived at the location. Turned out the guy wasn't there and went to the wrong location. So now he was 30 minutes away from my boyfriend's house. My boyfriend asked me to cancel the order if I can and get my refund. 
I called the delivery guy myself and he was good for nothing. At last, I canceled my order and I couldn't get any refund. I didn't tell my boyfriend about the refund because I don't want him to feel bad about it. He was already hungry and I made him wait for 35 or 40 minutes for his order that he didn't even get. 
He ate a few cookies and then went to sleep. He has to be up early tomorrow and told me to not worry about it. 
It's not a big issue but he has been so nice to me lately and I was hoping I could do something nice as well without making a mess.

I was very horny while talking to a friend on snapchat. Me and my male friend were talking on snapchat when we were really horny, all of that ""I wanna have s3x with you"" and ""my kinks are _______"" stuff.

We are a fan of roleplaying and stuff so roleplaying while horny over texts was not a good idea. He likes rough s3x, I like bound s3x and being told what to do and stuff. So we were just sending texts like he does something then I do something like: Me: *takes all of my clothes off*. And then Him: I'm gonna f*ck you so good baby girl. And all of that stuff.

So we got into a roleplay where I was just sucking his d!ck, ramming his d!ck up my pu55y and s3xual stuff. All of this was my idea, I'll admit to that.

Then because I was complaining that my internet worked, my dad needed my phone. I didn't change accounts so he was still texting me, thinking I had my phone. Suddenly a message popped up from him. My dad ACCIDENTLY clicks on it and saw all of the s3xual stuff we have been sending and now he doesn't trust me.

Lesson learnt: always change accounts when talking s3xual and dirty to people.

Not being a dummy, I cleaned out that coffee maker as best I could, then ran a few straight pots of water / vinegar through it. It ran a bit slow but I wasn't too worried. ""Good coffee takes time!""... Or so I thought. My first cup of coffee tasted a bit strange. I quickly attributed that to any lingering vinegar.

Fast forward a week or so later and the taste of the coffee hadn't improved, + the speed of the brew was noticeably slowing. So I decided to take it apart and give it a more thorough cleaning. I'm fairly mechanically inclined, so I was able to break it down with little effort. Feeling proud of myself, I accessed the water reservoir and emptied it. What came out was a sort of dark grainy sludge. At first I was annoyed, wondering ""How did coffee grounds get into the water reservoir?!"" As I stared at the sludge, my annoyance slowly turned into revulsion and horror. Yes, while stored out in the shed, mice had made my Mom's Tim Horton's coffee maker their home.

Secretly, I'm hoping to run into E, another tenor saxophonist in my grade, as I have a *massive* crush on him. That fleeting moment where we grab our saxophones and bid each other farewell is easily one of the highlights of my day. 

I race into the band storage room, and deflate a bit when I realize that there's only one sax in the cabinet - my cherished E has already come and gone! I grab my sax and then realize, with a twang of horror, that this is actually E's sax, and that he's accidentally taken mine. 

I'm awash with panic - for some reason, this is ""like, a really big deal!"". I rush out into the main band room, where my band teacher and the chorus teacher are chatting and getting ready to lock-up. I run over, and quickly explain the situation, and they ask me which number bus E usually rides. 

Now - I was always a bus rider - E, however, was not. His mother picked him up from school most days, and I had a habit of secretly watching him get into her car and drive off (Creepy much? I digress, middle school crushes are weird.). Anyway, I thought I had the info needed to sort the situation out, and in my panic, I made (what I later understood to be) one of the most embarrassing mistakes of my life.

""What bus does E take?""

""E doesn't take the bus, his mom picks him up!""

""Oh, well... do you know what his mom's car looks like?""

""It's a white vulva!""

At the time, I had no idea that ""Volvo"" was not the same word as ""vulva"". 

I must have said it 6 or 7 times over the course of my attempt to get this situation sorted out. How the teachers ever kept from bursting out laughing is beyond me - but I was painfully aware that there was an unusual lack of eye-contact throughout this entire exchange. I can't imagine how awkward it was from their perspective.

Anyway, E's mother had already driven off by the time we checked the parking lot. The kicker? I realize now, in hindsight, she actually drove a VW Jetta.

Then, my friend said we should watch something and turned on the TV. She likes animation, so we browsed Netflix for a while and found this really colourful and interesting-looking show called ""The Midnight Gospel"". It's basically an animated podcast made by  Pendleton Ward (the guy behind ""Adventure Time"") and Duncan Trussell.

In the beginning it was really fun and the trip was going great. Until the 5th episode called ""Annihilation of Joy"". 

In a big summary, it was a never-ending loop of a guy trying to leave a prison cell, dying and then trying again, after a terrifying image of purgatory.

I thought I could give the driver my aunt‚Äôs debit card when he delivers because I didn‚Äôt have enough cash. I was told to pay online, I was like nope. I‚Äôve ordered pizza before. 

So, I went to the lobby with no mask (mistake one) and a hoody and sweatpants‚Äînothing under (mistake 2). I thought It would be a minute transaction like usual. The man said he wasn‚Äôt going to take my card. I had to pay him online or give cash. I searched up Dominoes customer service, they told me to call my branch. My dumbass didn‚Äôt know it would be on my receipt. 

I ran out of the lobby, I forgot to get a mask and it was fucking cold. No jacket, no socks, no clothes except hoody and sweatpants. I was freezing. 

I ran crazily to the stores and Deli, they weren‚Äôt doing cash back even if I bought something. Then I entered the 4th deli and looked everybody was wearing a mask. And I touched my face‚ÄîNo Mask! Everybody even the cops and they were looking at me. Now, I got scared because I‚Äôm not eighteen, I have no mask, and that wasn‚Äôt my debit card, and this is NY. 

I just started rambling and telling my life story, God then The cop finally waved me over and let me go. And I asked the 4th store deli man for cash back. He said nope but there was an atm sort of thing in the back. He laughed and said, they were gonna take mad money from me. Now the cop was laughing and some man was laughing too. My phone internet stopped working when I went in and I didn‚Äôt know the debit pin.  Also, I wasn‚Äôt gonna be charged $3 or more to cash small money. I almost peed myself. Even the store wasn‚Äôt warm enough. 

I had to leave and go outside, looking for internet service and I asked someone for the Dominoes branch. They said look at my receipt. I got so mad. Called, Then the dominoes agent asked me for my zip code and I said 4 wrong zip codes. She kept on saying it wasn‚Äôt working, I kept looking around at the cop inside. I wasn‚Äôt tryna go to jail for debt card theft. Jail documentaries and movies really scared me. So, I searched google map for my address and got my zip code. Thank God for google map. 

Everything worked out but my uncle caught me outside when I was going home, with no mask, and I didn‚Äôt tell him I left his house. He wasn‚Äôt pleased. He just sent me home. Got yelled at, and we know when he tells my mom, she‚Äôs gonna finish my butt cuz she‚Äôs  an essential worker and all and she taught me better. 

So, now I‚Äôm home, in trouble and feeling slightly sick. I just hope that pizza is good, unless I‚Äôll cry in the bathroom. 

TL;DR: went out without mask while under dressed to pay for pizza. Card was not accepted, found no cash back near me. got caught by uncle, got laughed at by cop, deli man, and random dude, almost peed my pants and froze to death.",15,16,tifu
t3_kpotlr,"TIFU by reheating taco bell in my oven and nearly setting my apartment building ablaze, while blazed.","I finished work late and decided to pickup some taco bell on the way home because I am a garbage person and didn't want to cook.  I got stuck in traffic and it started to cool down, so I decided I would reheat it when I got home..  (hot garbage is best garbage)

I chucked it in a cold oven on the lowest setting and went outside for a jazz-cigarette. (hot garbage is even better when you're jazzed up)

I returned to an apartment smelling of delicious hot taco bell.

I excitedly opened the oven and flames and smoke erupted from it.

I immediately close the oven and turn it off.  I'm high.  My brains racing (as fast as it can) to solve this problem.

I fill up a water jug, open the oven, toss it in to douse the flames and shut the oven again.

The fire is now out, but now my apartment is filled with hot acidic smoke/steam.  Truly, hot garbage.

The building fire alarm turns starts.

Panic intensifies.  I'm about to have to explain (while high) to a firemen in front of all of my fellow residents how I'd just sent my taco bell on fire, but there is no fire anymore and everyone can go home.

I quickly open the windows, put my central heating on max fan to try to cycle some air out of my room and spend a quick minute hastily trying to clean up the evidence of my shameful mistake.

I start to head down the hallway with other residents, trying to play it cool like I don't know what's going on either.

MERCIFULLY the alarm stops before I make it to the elevator and I'm able to return to my now acrid apartment and deal with my mess in peace.  Fortunately my bedroom door was shut the whole time, so I only needed to wipe down every surface and mop the floor and leave the windows open all night.

TLDR: I tried to reheat taco bell in the oven, set fire to it, had to deal with the aftermath while high, and narrowly avoided any damage or embarrassment.

So I had a random ass nose bleed like an hour and a half ago, right? Got it to stop. We‚Äôre good. Then like 20 minutes ago I‚Äôm in the shower. I feel a sneeze coming. I‚Äôm full on yelling at myself telling myself not to sneeze. Because that shit hurts. And because, of course, I had just had a fucking nosebleed.

It didn‚Äôt work. I started sneezing. I‚Äôm holding my stomach trying not to hurt, at the same time trying not to sniff or blow my nose when I feel something at the back of my throat... So I sniffed. Hard. My body said, ‚ÄúF you, Bethula, we do what we WANT‚Äù. And I choked on the clot. That shit rockets across the shower as I sneeze again, yelping because I forgot to hold my tummy because I was concerned with the ick. It looked like a whole ass murder scene. Blood. Everywhere.

t3_kpnkwz,"TIFU by messaging a girl, things got spicy, had an accident.","This was about 5 weeks ago now, still want to cry every time I think about it.

So I have known this girl for about 2 years, let's call her Lindsey. So for a long time, me and Lindsey were into each other, but neither off us every expressed it or told the other person for a while. We were messaging, and just talking about general stuff when she brought up the topic of topless guys.

We went on talking about it, and she subtly hinted towards wanting to see me topless, so I was like alright and sent her a picture. She sent back a picture of her in her bra. A few more things went back and forth and she took off her bra. 

Obviously, like any man, seeing a girl without her bra on is bound to turn you on, so I started going at it. Things just kept getting spicier and spicier, lots of things were being shown. She said I'll be back in about 15 minutes, I need to have a shower, and sent me a whole ass nude before she went to leave me with.
Here's the fuck up.
I kept this picture on my screen, and got myself very close to nutting. I stopped myself and was like I've gotta wait til she gets back to finish. I didn't let go because I didn't want to lose the erection, so I just carried on slowly going at it.

I carried on choking the chicken, when I suddenly just came. She wasn't back yet, and I had just finished everywhere. She came back about 5 minutes later, and said ""now let's pick up where we left off yeah"". The embarrassment. The fear. As a man, I had lost all horniness in the one load, and was certainly not in the mood.

I had to say to this girl: ""so I may have nutted to you while you were in the shower, and now I don't really have the erection anymore you know""

We tried so hard to get it back. She sent more things,  I concentrated really hard to try and get it back, but to no avail. She was left unhappy, and I was left soft.

Was messaging a girl some spicy stuff and she said she would be back soon. I nutted to a picture of her and she came back asking for more, only to be disappointed and I was left sad.",36,17,tifu
t3_kpnf2h,TIFU by cheating myself out of selling my car by not knowing geography,"Obligatory: this was a few years ago.  

When I moved from the east coast to San Francisco, my goal was to sell my car and live that city lifestyle. I listed my car on Craigslist, and I was surprised that I got very few legitimate responses. So I would drop the price about $100 every other a day, and I was starting to get frustrated that I still had to deal with my car that I wasn‚Äôt using (moving it daily for street sweeping, circling around for parking, parallel parking backwards up hill).

I finally got an email from an interested party. Craigslist is full of scammers and you have to carefully sift through the responses, so I set up a call to talk about the car. They liked what they heard, they seemed legitimate, everything was going well. Then they asked if they could drive over to check it out. I said of course, and just casually asked where they were coming from. ‚ÄúPittsburgh‚Äù they replied. I distinctly remember changing my tone and being curt and saying ‚Äúthanks but no thanks‚Äù as I didn‚Äôt want to wait for someone to cover the 2,700 miles before they could test drive my car. 

It took another week, but I eventually sold the car to a family in Berkeley. Only after dropping the price another $400 of course. 


About a month later I‚Äôm riding the BART (regional train) for the first time and I‚Äôm looking at the map, and lo and behold at the very end of the yellow line, not at all far from the city, is Pittsburg, California. In my defense, the missing ‚Äòh‚Äô at the end of the word isn‚Äôt spoken.

t3_kpmuak,TIFU by telling a customer they're bad at their job,"This happened a couple of years ago, but is by far the biggest fuck-up I've ever committed.

I was working in a cinema at the time and Avengers: Endgame was out. I was working the day shift in the week so it was relatively quiet. A woman came out of her Avengers screening complaining about the sound balance. I went to check in the screen and the movie sounded normal. So I went to check the sound level on the speakers and they were all set to the normal levels.

I came back and explained to the woman that all of our levels were normal. She insisted that they weren't. Now, I'm somewhat of a movie buff and have noticed a trend in recent years of action films having really poor sound mixing. The dialogue is usually too quiet and the action too loud. I don't know where this trend came from, but everyone seemed to finally realise when Tenet came out and they couldn't hear a damn thing anyone was saying.

So, I said to her that that's just how Endgame sounds. That for whatever reason, the sound mixers made the dialogue too quiet and that I find it to be a really annoying stylistic choice in modern filmmaking.

The look of rage that engulfed her face cannot be described. I don't think I've ever seen someone go from 0-100 on the anger meter that fast.

""I *AM* THE SOUND MIXER!"" she said. Turns out she worked at Pinewood Studios and was the person responsible for what I had just described as bad sound design to her face.

She went on a whole tirade about how she knows more than me as I just had to stand there and take it. I still stand by my belief that the sound mixing in Endgame was not good, but I never thought I'd end up saying that to the person responsible for it.

TL;DR Was working at a cinema and a customer complained about Endgame being too quiet. I told her the sound mix was bad, turns out she was one of the sound mixers for the movie.

EDIT: I am talking about Pinewood Studios in London, England, not the one in Atlanta, Georgia.

EDIT 2: There's no need to call her a bitch, guys, I've had far more hostile customers, believe me. Maybe she was just having a bad day. I'm sure she's a nice person.

EDIT 3: Please stop suggesting that I should have taken her to personally inspect the equipment. I would have been fired for breaking a myriad of rules. It was a no-win situation.

EDIT 4: The cinema in question wasn't far from several major production studios and several high-profile location sites for big Hollywood movies. So the odds of me serving someone who worked on Endgame (which was partially made essentially down the road from me) are actually pretty high.

EDIT 5: She might have worked at Shepperton Studios, which is next to Pinewood. I'm honestly not sure which one it was.

FINAL EDIT I PROMISE: I fully acknowledge that she knows more about sound mixing than me or most of the people in this thread. However, as consumers, we have a right to voice our opinion if we don't like a product. The fact that the VAST MAJORITY of the commenters agree that action films nowadays are way too loud in some places and quiet in others shows that there is clearly a problem. You don't have to be a professional chef to know if your food tastes bad, and you don't need to be a professional sound mixer to know if a movie sounds like trash.",31633,1535,tifu
t3_kpmpay,TIFU by looking around a bit too much in my moms room,"So this didn't happen today, but around the summertime, so think around July. There is a few things that I should explain, I am a male, but not exactly the straightest cookie, but I can't find the best thing for what I feel. I should also mention that I am insanely curious, but also at that age where people become extremely horny, (this will become sort of important later), I should also say that my mom is one of those people who are tough, yet you somehow can't stay mad at. I was also looking for a Halloween ""costume"" to wear, although I would also use it for a story I was writing as sort of a basis for event.

With all of that out of the way, I had been going around the house, looking for things to create this costume I wanted, I went through all the boxes and things to go to thrift store, there I found a top for what I needed. Now all I needed was a bottom, but referring to the curious part of the above, I decided to go into my moms room, I knew that there was a few things there that I would be needing, now I should say that none of the stuff I took was worn all that much due to the pandemic, so I got some leggings and shoes from the closet, I decided to snoop around a bit more, and at some point came to the drawer right next to my moms bed. Now I should say, that this drawer, I though contained a flashlight and some other emergency equipment, I had seen it open before when I was younger. I opened the drawer, not expecting much, and right there, I saw a butt plug, I could have guessed that some of the fabric had parted to expose it, but there it was. I stupidly decided to open it further, and Bam!, there was a dildo, right on top of some of the fabrics, that would turn out to be some, well very exposing clothes. I then decided it would be a good idea to dig further, I found a vibrator, and tons of lube, some of it had leaked, it was a slippery, gooey mess, and then there was a paddle with the text of ""Attitude Adjuster!"", I had seen this before in the time when I was younger. So you want to know what I decide to do, not close it and back away, but take it away to my room to experiment with them. I didn't ever do anything with them, and eventually returned them, but I would occasionally get really horny and want to get that dick back out for some more play. Oh wait, there was also some handcuffs that I took for the costume to go around my wrist, just both on one, but thats not exactly important. But this just sort of ruined my image of my mom, I couldn't just look at her the same knowing that she may have played around with this stiff, slimy dick in her younger years, and possibly now. The thought of her kinky times always just scared me, but I never expected that she would have these sort of things.

TL;DR: I went around looking for some cross dressing costume, and found my moms kinky toys

Edit: I just want to clear things up, I never used them, considered it, but never actually did it, also I made damn sure to take pictures of the scene to make sure I put them back where they were, so I really dont want my mom to find out, the handcuffs were at the back and there has been no suspicion, I am currently considering to return them, but I haven't gotten a chance yet.",3,11,tifu

I was just browsing the intertwebs minding my own business when I hear cats shrieking and freaking tf out. I run to the front door to protect my cats from other alpha males and fling it open, screeching the loudest screech I could muster (I am usually able to get to quite painful pitches, especially when angered/in a state of rage and motherly protectiveness).

One of the cats (and to be honest im not quite sure if it was mine or the intruder who was tryna bully it) scrammed down the strairs, zooming at full speed whilst simultaneously shitting it self.

This left a trail of poop. I never knew cats could produce this amount of excrement. It was all over the staircase. We had to call someone to clean it. I can still smell the faint odour.

t3_kpmeai,TIFU but thinking a coyote was a dog that needed rescuing....,"So mandatory not today. Was actually a couple years ago. Let me set the scene. I lived out on the country in a lake cabin with my then bf (now husband) and toddler. We had a beautiful pond right out the backdoor to the place with a little dock. Very lovely. 

So one day bf is working toddler is asleep and I'm reading a nice book just relaxing when out of no where I start hearing barking and growling. I peak out the back door (important to note I wear glasses and had recently broken my only pair so couldn't see well)  and saw 2 dogs. One was some sort of beagle or hound. the other I couldn't quite make out bc the other dog had it pinned down in the shallow of the pond. Barking and growling at it anytime it tried to get out of the water. 

My idiotic bleeding heart thought OMG that dog is going to kill that other dog so I thought I'll go out and make some noise and scare it off.i start off outside and begin to walk to where the dogs are but the closer I get the more I notice the dog in the water looks....off and very angry and aggressive. I'm about 5 feet away when the dog in the water attempted to lunge out of the water at me and that is when it hit me HOLY SHIT THAT'S A FUCKING COYOTE!!!! I had never actually seen a coyote before but my blood went cold in those 2 seconds I thought I was going to die! But the good beagle pupper jumped at the coyote properly backing it all the way up into the water again and I hightailed it back into the house! Called my bf and he sent his dad out to get them off the property. We've moved since this so I don't have to worry about that happening again but oh boy did I learn a lesson that day.

t3_kpks4j,TIFU and forgot to turn off my camera...,"So before I start the story, a really short backstory:

In September, I started 9th grade. In our country's school system, whenever we, students start 9th grade, we have to join a new school with other classmates. In my new class, there are 37 students (this includes me) and only 7 of these are boys (I'm a boy too). 

So, let's get into the story.

School has been fully online since September and we haven't met each other yet. Because of this, we often do conversations on Zoom. There are about 6-7 people in these conversations, although when we first started doing them, most of the class took part.

I join most of these conversations, and every time I've joined, I was the only boy in there. All the other 5-6 people were girls and usually the same people.

On avarage, we have 1 or 2 of these conversations per week, so I know a lot about these girls. One of them is pretty weird (not like anyone in the world is normal, cause I'm also the biggest weirdo in the universe, but she is outstandingly weird).

Let's call this girl Emma. So in a conversation about 2 months ago, she said the following, ignoring that I was there too (don't ask me what we were talking about, I don't remember): ""I actually like to wear short clothes and to act in a way which makes guys horny. I know that I have a stunning body and I take advantage of that, cause I know that guys would do anything for me if they like my body.""

I know this is a weird thing to say and people will start to not believe me here but, she did say that. Before I continue, I just want to say that I'm not the type of guy who would do anything for a sexy girl, cause I will not fall in love with a girl just because they have a great body.

But... I gotta admit, I do become horny most of the times when I see Emma. She usually wears clothes that only cover the lower half of her breasts and she does generally act in a sexy way - on purpose. For example, she often pretends that she has to pull up her shirt constantly because it's sliding down, when in reality, she makes it obvious that SHE is pulling her shirt down just a tiny bit constantly, so that she has to pull it up constantly, so that she can make a big deal out of it. Anyways.

So yesterday, Emma, 4 other girls and me were in a Zoom call. We all turned our cameras on, and Emma was sitting in front of the camera with wet hair and a very tiny bra. She said that she just had a bath and she was just drying her hair, but she thought she'll join the call anyways and dry her hair during the call.

One of the other girls asked her why she didn't at least put on actual clothes, and she said: ""Gosh, I'll put some on after drying my hair. I though you'd like if I joined the conversation in time, so I did."" In my opinion, this is kinda a weird excuse and she was just trying to ""show"", cause these conversations usually go on for 3-4 hours, but... I'm probably wrong. Although this isn't really normal from a girl in my opinion. Or even from just a person. Who would join a call with one or more people from the other gender, when they are without ""actual clothes"" and have wet hair.

Anyways. So, I was currently wearing pretty tight jeans and underpants (I don't have many clothes, and when I woke up only these were dried lol) and I was getting hard, so I knew it would become uncomfortable on the ""southern parts"" after a short while.

Since I woke up, some of my sweatpants got dried and I knew it would be more comfortable in those, so I made up the following ridiculous excuse: ""I gotta go for a few minutes, I'll be right back"", I turned off my camera and mic, stood up, I pulled down my jeans and underpants (as I said, those were pretty tiny too) and I got some other underpants and some sweatpants.

After I finished dressing up, I sat back next to my computer, I clicked on the camera button and... instead of my camera screen or whatever, Zoom was showing my name. I knew what this meant: my camera didn't turn off and all the girls saw everything.

I was extremely embarassed, I left the call and I only joined back after a few minutes. Then I just stared at the screen. All 5 girls were laughing, but I was crying inside. After a minute or so, the girls finally stopped laughing and Emma said: ""So, which one of us made you horny?"" And then they continued laughing.

At that moment, I felt like I had two choices. I could either run away and leave the call or be brave, stay there and make fun of the situation. I decided that the second one would be a better choice. It would show that I don't make a big deal out of this and thus, the other girls would also not do so. Also, the other thing I thought was that running away and not facing the consequences of a mistake is not a great choice, doesn't matter what the mistake is.

So, I stayed there and replied to Emma: ""You"", then I started laughing on purpose. They also continued to laugh. Then, after we all stopped laughing (and Emma dried her hair and put on some actual clothes off-camera), we had an absolutely normal conversation and nobody brought it up that day anymore.

I dunno why I wrote down this story, but I felt so embarassed at that moment and I still can't frickin believe this happened, I just had to write it down.

Hopefully they won't bring this story up in the future but if they do, I'm gonna share that.

One last thing: sorry for my bad english and any miswritten words (that might be cause of english or cause of autocorrect)

TL;DR: I changed clothes, but forgot to turn off my camera while in a Zoom call with 5 other girls. Tgey saw my cock while I was hard. When I realized it, instead of leaving the call, I faced the consequences and laughed at myself.",191,39,tifu
t3_kpj9ld,"TIFU by deciding to try something new, unexpectedly ended up high, and my family just might kill me now","It's 3:41am now, but was 1:49am when I woke because of the smell.

This happened just a few hours ago and I'm dreading how bad it will be in the morning. It's probably going to end up as family-be-gone or some other equally horrible thing. 

Last night I got a notification that my package had finally arrived and it's something I've been very interested to have and use for a while. I get the mailbox key, and go pick it up. I get home, open it up and immediately I can smell a very strong odor that is definitely not a positive one, but I dismiss it and continue looking at everything that I've bought. It's a smudging set. So there is an abalone shell, a stand for the shell, two feathers, three crystals, a selenite wand, a palo santo stick, and a bundle of sage. (The sage is locally grown)

Each of these items by themselves don't have any kind of offensive odor to them. I've even tested some loose bits of the sage to make sure I won't hate the scent. I don't, it's not my favorite, but I certainly won't be too upset with it. Here's where tfu comes in.

A few hours pass and I decide to use this set, and like a giddy teenager, I'm not going to read to directions/guide that came with all these items. So at 10:30 I set everything up on my fire resistant cloth mat, and I grab a lighter. The palo santo stick is first and it's a pleasant smell, but definitely not one I really enjoy, it burns out very quickly and stops smoking very quickly as well. Next comes the sage. I'm trying to light the entire bottom, but the bundle keeps smoking a lot for a few seconds, and then the embers go out just as quickly. Obviously this means I need to do more. So I do.

I do this two more times while trying to get the entire bottom of the sage bundle to smoke. Then I realized that I never opened a window. I get up and open a window. This turns out to be perfect because now, attempt number 4, the entire bottom has burned and is giving off even more smoke and I'm sitting there feeling really great for my progress and that wasn't so hard after all. I've figured out the learning curve and this is amazing! I quickly put smoke in all four corners of the room and saw whatever comes to mind as I cleanse this space, all the while feeling better and better about this. Well, I feel so much better that I've decided to light it one more time just to just to ensure that I understand how to do this again. There is so much smoke, and I'm feeling really excited that there is so much because now I'll be able to use it for myself and not just the room.

I smudge myself and when I'm done the sage really starts to hit me, so now I'm feeling like I'm on top of the world. The amount of happiness I feel must be due to clearing out the negative energy in the room, right? WRONG!

At this point it's been 10 minutes, and my brother comes out of the office to ask what the smell is that's making him feel so nauseous. I'm still sitting on the floor feeling more and more positive as the moments pass. A few questions later, and I'm getting up to open all the windows I can, and the back door as well to try and air out the house.

 My job now done, so I decided to curl up with my kindle and read. Trouble is, I'm now high as a kite and calling my best friend that she needs to scone over and help me cleanse the rest of the house. While on the call, it hits me that I am not behaving normally, the thought keeps bugging me so I google it. Turns out that Salvia Sage can get you high for about half an hour. Then it gives you a sense of calm for quite a while afterwards.

2 hours later, after figuring this out and the smoke finally working its way upstairs, I'm getting other family members coming down to ask about the smell. I'm saying it's a new candle and I won't use it again.

3:37 as I post this and 45¬∞F outside which is cold in Southern California. The window is open again I'm cold, and my stomach is cramping because of the smell. No one else is up yet.

TLDR: First time burning sage. I forgot to open a window and the smell woke me up by making my stomach cramp. The smell is in absolutely everything...",24,6,tifu

so on friday is my cousin's wedding. just a civil wedding, we're not attending the main ceremony except for my mom since she's a special guest. only in reception which the thing is we all (me, my brother, and dad) don't want to go since covid but my mom is mad as heck plus a terror woman because she said it would be shameful not to go to. i know that my country has a limited number of people who can gather which is below 10 but i doubt the reception to only have that amount of people. she said that we can stay in the car after eating. god, i hate her for that, and also probably the reason why my shoelaces has gone through the drainage. 

back to the main story, she told me to find some shoes to prepare even if the wedding is a week away. i found all of my (rubber) shoes and shown her everything. i'm already exhausted because she kept asking me about it last night, now i still gotta clean the house and scrub/dust off my selected shoes for the wedding. the shoes that i chose are not expensive, pretty much just the cheapest mall rubber shoes that i used for my school (before covid). both were dusty so i cleaned them by scrubbing the plain black clothing and the veeeeery dirty white sides (I don't know what they were called lol). both shoes were done. now, with the laces which i don't want to wash at first since they seemed kinda clean already but they're just laces, easy to clean so why not. i scrubbed them both quickly and washed them with the same water. now here comes the dumb part. as i was draining the water, i dumbly pour it all with my the thin laces in it, directly through the big and wide open drainage. i was just staring with mouth open. what the heck did i just do?! i tried to stuck my fingers inside but realised it's already gone. it just easily and smoothly drained.

i was still shook as heck and my eyes were teary bc what the heck. i wanted to tell my parents but i remembered i was in a bad mood and i know they'll just scream at me for being dumb. i tried to just be quiet and find for my another pair of laces. gladly, i found another one but I can't just let go of the feeling that they just freakingly drained so smooth. like what the heck. my head aches so bad. i gotta sleep lol.

+ also maybe you're wondering, can't i just get them or open the pipes to get the laces? well no, the drainage is cemented and is directed thru the sewages,,,,, so, swim free my shoelaces. 

tl;dr : i washed my pair of shoes that i have to wear for an occasion. without knowingly, when i finished washing my shoelaces, i accidentally poured the dirty water with the laces in it thru the damn drainage. i'm so dumb.",5,4,tifu
t3_kphqg2,TIFU by purchasing Persona Endless Night Collection,"(Apologies for bad mobile formatting.)
*Also, obligatory ‚Äúthis was not today.‚Äù*
Soooo, allow me to give a bit of context. 
Persona Dancing: Endless Night Collection is a bundle of three Persona Dancing games: 3, 4, and 5. 4 being the most interesting, with a story mode and best OST in my opinion, while the other two being basic rehashes of this game with different OSTs, dances and models without any real story mode. 
As part of the bundle, Persona 4 Dancing is a digital download as opposed to the other two being physical discs. 
Cut to receiving this bundle on Christmas, and to my surprise; *The digital download code had expired 20 days earlier.* It was never specified before purchasing that this was an issue, and nothing much has come out of customer service. 
All I could find was other people with the same issue warning people *not* to buy the bundle. P3D and P5D are... mediocre, but it‚Äôs also bad on my part for not looking into things before walking into disappointment.
EDIT: gramatical errors 
TL;DR: Bought Persona Dancing collection, ended up without the best game in the collection.",0,2,tifu

  fuck 2020, right? well. fucking my way into 2021 did not fare well for me...

  my on-again off-again gal sent me a text the day before seeing what was up and we agreed to shack up in lieu of all things 2020, and of course the New Year approaching. it didn't take long before we got into the sex stuff...me on top, her on bottom as usual. for context, i cannot stress the on-again off-again thing enough - we've been together (kinda) for 2.5 years, break up about as often as the wind blows (almost not kidding), and i haven't been with anyone nor has she (afaik) in this time. well, to put it plainly, sex and cuddles are the only thing we do 'right.'  i cannot stress this enough - i'm a tall dude and she's a petite gal. it's fun. we cuddle and do the lovey-dovey stuff pretty awesome as well. other than that, we suck.

  while i'm off track, lemme backtrack a sec; a little over a year and a half ago i got sober/clean. she was instrumental in this process to say the least. i never in a million years would've considered sobering up...not even after my dwi early last spring and then getting out of jail, freaking out and booking a one-way ticket to LA. i called her up, we talked, she told me to come home, i did. i was in LA 16 hours. to stay on topic (sex stuff), my health was so bad pre-sobriety...really bad, but my will to keep doing sex stuff was greater. on two different occasions during this period i was injured during sex stuff as well: 

  - passing out after sex stuff walking to the kitchen to get some water - [mild concussion/8 stitches] (https://i.imgur.com/wygy3RJ.jpg)
  - and much more serious...a micro aneurysm

yeah kids, don't do drugs. 

  so, back on track; i was on top, she was on bottom. her finishing move is getting on top of me so i hopped off and laid on my back and she got on...it took about 15 seconds of the hard riding then....

  **pop**

 she felt it, i felt it (of course), but what's really funny is that we both finished right after. no idea how i pulled that one off considering my dick just snapped. and, i never come out of her since she's so small - can't really explain why it happened. but, yeah...poor little guy is pretty sore and bruised so terrifyingly bad (pic below this post) - meet with the urologist on Monday, and one last time...

t3_kp2hpw,TIFU by Giving Away Shit My Wife Had Posted For Sale,"TIFU by giving away shit my wife actually had listed for sale on Facebook Marketplace.

I'm moving fort a new job. As a result, we are leaving a 3200 sq ft home of 12 years where we raised our three kids through most their lives. A layoff, Covid, new job, etc necessitated a move to a new state.  The cost of housing, and two of the three kids moved out, it's time to downsize by at least 1/3.  

For over a month, we've been decluttering, upgrading our home to sell, fixing issues, etc.

Back to decluttering.  We've had garage sales and been listing things for sale through every medium we can manage.  And the trash.  Literally TONS of trash from kids schoolwork to wife's teaching materials collected over 25 years.  Oh yeah.  Wife is a teacher of a small one room school house that she had to close because of the move.  So all that stuff had to find a new home, too.  Lots and lots of stuff.  Think of the TV show Hoarders but with the benefit akin to being a functional alcoholic. Not TV worthy but still a legit mess of just utter crap.

Well, yesterday, my wife asked where a youth bow went. I sort of remember it being loaded up into the suburban and taken to Goodwill.  Turns out she had it posted for sale and arrive was inquiring about it. I rushed to Goodwill where I was afraid is taken it the night before.  Sure enough, the folks there remembered it and said they just put it on the floor an hour earlier.  We rushed out and sure enough, it had already been sold.

Later last night my wife asked about another item. And another.  You see, we were clearing out the garage and she was sorting stuff: Goodwill, Sell, trash.  Well, the Goodwill and Sell piles got intermixed, I was drugged on Benadryl because of the dust and, well, all the Sell stuff wound up at bargain basement prices a quarter mile away at the local Goodwill.

She was not pleased. I'm not pleased. 

TLDR; TIFU. Wife had me sort stuff we were downsizing into three piles: Sell, Donate and Trash. I donated all the Sell stuff accidentally even though she had those items listed online to sell.",4,3,tifu

t3_kpfqsw,TIFU when my Mom called the cops on a break-in that never happened.,"
Hi guys, so this is my first post ever and I made a reddit account just for this subreddit. I actually listened to a Reddit podcast once so this is how I came to know about this community. English isn‚Äôt my first language so forgive me for any bad grammar/punctuation. Also this might get a little long but bear with me. This isn‚Äôt exactly recent, it happened almost two years ago. 

 Let me give you guys some background knowledge. We recently moved to a really nice area (I‚Äôd guess you can say it‚Äôs upper middle class/lower high class) that has a mix of farms on some areas and modern housing/stores in another. We moved to a newly built townhouse/neighborhood that was not even on the map yet. This townhouse was as big as a large single home with 3 large rooms, a basement and a two car garage (to use as a size reference for later on the story). Now this area being very family-oriented, there is basically little to no crime over here but it was still kind of close to a major city which is still iffy with their crime rate. Also please note that I‚Äôm a recently turned young adult who grew up with strict parents so I had to do some stupid things to get out of their grip. We moved and usually in our culture we throw a celebration inviting everyone we basically know. So I may be exaggerating or maybe not since I didn‚Äôt count each person, but that‚Äôs basically about 60-70 people with their screaming kids in one single TOWNHOUSE (this was months before COVID for the worried ones). The rooms were all full and some kids were even in my room (of course I was annoyed). I was the oldest of the family so I was basically in charge of making sure 30 something screaming demon spawn kids weren‚Äôt breaking anything or getting themselves hurt. This will tie into the story later.


So on with the story, my parents are strict and never really supported the idea of me having a boyfriend or hanging out with a guy friend until I graduate university (everything from under grad to grad, mind you) However, I did date a few guys back when I was a teen but I truly fell in love with someone about five years ago and it‚Äôs never been a different guy since. With him being my first love, I was willing to do anything for him, so of course being the oldest kid of strict parents I had no one to ask for help in the family for times I wanted to hangout with him. I usually had to resort to sneaking out during the middle of the night‚Äîpast 2am or whenever my parents fell asleep or saying I‚Äôm with so and so or say I‚Äôm working.. before we moved. However with this new house, I was scared to try to sneak out since I haven‚Äôt done it before and wasn‚Äôt used to the ‚Äòsounds‚Äô of the house. To clarify, the AC sound or the floor squeaks (idk how to describe that) you‚Äôll get whenever you walk or the sounds of the door knobs turning, etc. My mom is basically a ninja so she‚Äôs able to hear even the tiniest of sounds, so I HAD to take everything to account. It took me about a week of studying every sound at night and my family‚Äôs sleep schedule/antics to finally gather up my courage to sneak out. This was actually a last minute thing since I didn‚Äôt plan on doing it that specific day but my cousins had called me saying they‚Äôre at the karaoke bar with my boyfriend and told me to come. I really wanted to go since I never went to a karaoke bar with my boyfriend since he and I never really got to go out on dates with each other (we mostly drove around and had mini road trips late night). So I was super determined, I caked myself up,  wore comfortable but still stylish clothes and waited for my parents to head to their bedroom. I waited and waited until It was 12am and they FINALLY did, phew. However with my ninja of a mom, I had to make sure they were pre-occupied or asleep before I left. After waiting for another half hour, I heard my dad snore and I quietly opened my door. Since our house was newly built there were basically no sounds made but I made sure to wear socks since our living room and stairs were hardwood. A tip from an experienced house sneaker outter is to wear socks if you live in a house with hardwood flooring or else you‚Äôll make sounds with every footstep when your skin sticks to the wood. The socks definitely did the trick and I made it to the basement in no time (I was tiptoeing slowly each step just to be extra quiet). Now the fun part was, how was I going to get out when it was a townhouse with basically only one exit that is quiet? Our garage was obviously way too loud to be an exit, and I wasn‚Äôt sure about the door yet since we barely used it (state law saying the road in front of our house is their road so we can‚Äôt park our cars). Well I didn‚Äôt prepare a whole week planning on my future late night adventures for nothing. I pretty much thought it was a brilliant idea to cut out the black mesh of window screen wide enough for me to get out. So yeah, my choice of escape was through the window. Also a little reminder that we lived NOT just in our tiny neighborhood road but the main road that our community uses. The front of our house was facing that main road‚Äîwith a traffic light some distance away and behind the house (where the garage is facing) is where the neighborhood road is. I was nervous while getting out since I had bad anxiety, I kept pausing every single time but with a push of courage I finally got out and closed the window. I wasn‚Äôt able to close it fully to my dismay, but it was a few centimeters close. Now just when I stepped out, I could hear a damn creature hissing at me. I immediately froze on the spot and only then did I realize why some people freeze during times of fear. I shook myself and opened the window as fast as possible and jumped inside like some track star. I didn‚Äôt know then what that creature was but sometime later I found out it was a snake. I panicked as I thought my mom would hear the noise and I closed the window and hid in the storage room just in case. 

After waiting for about 10 more minutes she didn‚Äôt come down so I started planning again. I looked outside my window and saw that there was nothing there. I had to keep encouraging myself to open the window and step out. This time I wore boots just in case. I successfully stepped out as a car passed by and I prayed to God they didn‚Äôt think I was some burglar since I looked so suspicious coming out of a damn window at what‚Äôs basically now 1:30 am. Imagine seeing that while driving by, would that be creepy or would that be funny since I immediately went to the front door holding the house key for God knows what. I just wanted to prove I lived there by doing something stupid when the car already passed by. I sighed at my stupidity and walked to my car that I parked far away from my house to cover the engine sound. 
I went to the karaoke bar and had a bunch of fun and basically slept over my boyfriend‚Äôs house after. I left early morning at 7am before my family woke up. I used the front door this time, bringing in McDonald‚Äôs breakfast for them as an excuse of why I was awake so early. Luckily none of them heard me as they were sound asleep. I walked up to my room and slept for a while until I heard a loud knock on my door. I could hear my mom panicking and my Dad trying to calm her down saying ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll call the cops.‚Äù My mind blanked out when I heard this and i slowly opened the door. My Mom was asking me whether I went out and I said no, and my Dad replied asking if I invited any friends over late at night which I also denied, acting sleepy and confused. I felt super guilty and mega worried of what was going on. My Dad went on to say that someone broke into our house and I just stared. That couldn‚Äôt be possible or was it possible since I didn‚Äôt fully close our window. I went downstairs where my Mom was and sure enough the evidence of my stupidity was in plain sight. When I went back inside from the snake scare I must have gotten mulch all over the window sill and on the carpet floor. So with the black mesh being ripped and the mulch all over the window and onto the floor, it obviously looks like a break in. My Mom was saying how the burglar came in yet didn‚Äôt take anything valuable so it was so weird. By this point I‚Äôm killing myself over and over again my my head. I scrambled my thoughts and tried to calm myself as any kid who got caught by strict parents would usually do before saying something as our every word/action is dissected and analyzed by those hawk-like parents. I acted like I was confused and agreed with her and continued to walk upstairs to avoid any other confrontation that would expose my late night outing. I stayed in my room the whole time while my parents called the cops. I was thinking of all the ways the cops would be able to find evidences that it was me who opened that window. However I was never able to do anything since my parents were in the basement the whole time until the cop came. He examined everything and asked my parents a bunch of questions. The cop came again a day later and looked for fingerprints with a blue powder (I‚Äôm not informed of the specific name of it) and I knew I was f***ed. My safe neighborhood didn‚Äôt seem so safe now with this ‚Äòbreak-in‚Äô since my Dad texted everyone in their neighborhood group chat (yes, a whole group chat) so you can imagine how serious everyone is about their community and their living situation. The whole neighborhood was panicking and buying cameras to install, and everyone continued to ask us for updates. It was hectic and furthered my guilt. It took me about a week to finally come clean‚Äîwith a lie. Yes, unfortunately I lied to cover up a lie, I‚Äôm disappointed in myself but what could my young self do. I‚Äôd probably get disowned if I had said the truth. I basically told my mom it was me who broke the black mesh but it was by accident from the time the kids stayed in the basement, I accidentally kicked the mesh and it had ripped. I‚Äôm known for breaking things btw. She was surprised and angry since I kept it to myself for so long, and I told her how could I when they had called the cops. I explained that I also did not know if it was actually a burglar since the mulch was there, but since my brother was playing soccer that day, it was probably from him since he tends to do that (I forgot to write this down on background info). My mom had said earlier that the mulch could be from my brother but she wasn‚Äôt sure since the black mesh was ripped. 

After I admitted this she was both relieved and super angry which I totally understand. But of course like any strict and ninja-like parent how could my lie sound 100% convincing? I‚Äôm sure she has some doubt in her mind, but at least with me admitting it she knows now it had to do with me and not some random person. 
So this is basically my story of how my Mom called the cops of a break-in that never really happened. Thank you for tuning in, and sorry if it was long, I really have a habit of adding extra unneeded info a lot. 

P.s Months later my brother cracked the window with just a slight punch to it. This made my parents think the windows are indeed easy to break so I think it helped my case a little bit now.


TL;DR

Strict parents so I snuck out through the window, it was possible with mesh I ripped. 
Mom sees the mess and the ripped mesh the next morning, so she calls the cops thinking it was a break-in.
The cop came and examined for fingerprints that undoubtedly had mine all over it. 
Neighbors all panicked since it was a new neighborhood that was just built a few months prior, and it was an extremely safe area. 
I admitted later on it was me but with an embellished lie. I got off with basically no consequences except for another fuel to deepen my anxiety.",21,3,tifu

t3_kpf9s4,TIFU by accidentally training my puppy to be a drug sniffer dog,"Obligatory not today, this happened 4 years ago.

During my second last year of high school our family got a new dog (poodle x labrador). It was during the end of year break and my whole family was working full time so I had the whole house to myself all day. I am not a regular smoker and haven't smoked weed in at least 6 months but at this point I was smoking every day for pretty much the whole holidays.

 I had a routine where I would wake up, make myself some breakfast, and then go outside for a joint. The dog at this point was about 6-8 months old (coincidentally the perfect time to start training) and was very playful and energetic. To counteract this, when I went outside with my weed I would take a handful of treats and feed them to her so she wouldn't annoy me while I was trying to roll.

I had already taught her to sit before I gave her each treat, however during this period of wake-bake-repeat she would come out with me and sniff around the bag with my weed, rolling papers and other paraphernalia in it (which at this point stunk because I'd used it for months). In between doing this, and me telling her to sit and then feeding her a reward, retrospectively it's pretty easy to see what was going to happen.

Anyway, after maybe 2 weeks or so of this routine, I had finished smoking one day and was back up in my room and the bag full of goodies was lying on my floor. Cue the puppy walking in, proceeding to nudge and sniff around the bag, and then sitting right in front of it staring straight at me. At this point I was pretty high so it didn't hit me immediately but the second it did I could not stop laughing for 10 minutes straight.

I was sure I was imagining things as I was high, so a couple hours later when it had all worn off, I tried it several times more with near identical results. Nothing ever came of it even though it happened several times more but I can't say I wasn't terrified for months that my dog was going to snitch me out to my parents by finding my stash.

TL;DR I fed my dog treats while sniffing weed and now she's a narc",583,39,tifu

So yesterday me (24M) and this guy (28M) get talking on Grindr, and we hit it off so we take the convo to Instagram. We're generally both good at talking banter and taking the piss out of ourselves/each other.

Fast forward to today, and I'm working during the day but have arranged to meet this guy for a drinks or whatever later. So throughout the day we jokingly ""cancel"" on each other - he cancelled on me for preferring tonic rather than soda with my gin, I cancel for some other minor reason. But it's all sarcastic and good fun.

Then, at one particular point (I've been messaging for hours at my desk since it's a quiet day), I get up and go to the bathroom. At the same time, he tells me jokingly to ""get back to work."" Me, sitting on the toilet, naturally want to send something funny back. So I send an expiring snap of my pants around my ankles - no genitals or anything. And then say ""I'm taking a break.""

(For context, a couple of my friends and I have a running joke of taking a pic of pants around our ankles at various random times... I know I know.)

At first, I think his reaction of disgust is sarcastic, like the earlier times we've ""cancelled."" 

And then I realise he's actually being serious. He says he ""couldn't be more turned off"" and asks me to stop messaging him. I say goodbye and unfollow on Insta, and I check later and he's done the same.

I had my video settings set to ""mirror video"" and just assumed the mirrored view of myself would be what everyone else sees. Well, IT'S NOT. 

Here's where I messed up: I can get anxious during zoom meetings, so I sometimes secretly hold a stuffed animal to help me feel better. On my screen, I always make sure to hide the stuffed animal behind the little box that says my name so that people can't tell that I'm holding a stuffed animal. Someone mentioned something about it to me at one of my zoom meetings, so I just assumed that I had accidentally moved the stuffed animal into view. Since then, I have been extra, extra careful with my positioning of the stuffed animal--making sure that it never moves from its hiding place behind my name box.

I was bored during a long meeting today and decided to mess around with my video settings. I unchecked the box for the mirror video setting and realized that not only was my red panda build a bear visible, I had positioned myself so closely to the corner that I thought was hiding him that I had accidentally actually placed him in an awkwardly prominent place. I messaged my friend who was in the meeting like ""wtf,, everyone can see that I'm holding a stuffed animal right now??!?"" and they said ""yeah, I just thought it was really cute.""

t3_kpd94v,TIFU by accidentally creating a false bomb threat causing the entire school to go on lockdown,"As is tradition, this happened about thirteen years ago and I am on mobile.

I attended an exceedingly poorly run middle school where the administration decided the best response to kids fighting/throwing food in the cafeteria was to make everyone wait outside for the first lunch shift to clear out the cafeteria before the next lunch shift could enter. Anyone who has worked with middle schoolers knows corralling them is like herding cats and the lunch shifts were severely understaffed. So kids would lolly-gag in the cafeteria to avoid going to class and hold up the lunch shifts. This meant that by the last lunch shift, we spent 1/3-1/2 of our half hour lunch waiting outside in the Texas heat.

My best friend, ‚ÄúJasper,‚Äù and I got bored waiting for lunch and, being the massive geeks that we are, decided to re-enact Potter Puppet Pals, specifically ‚ÄúThe Mysterious Ticking Noise.‚Äù (I now despise JK Rowling‚Äôs TERF stances, anti-semitism and cultural appropriation and the irony of two closeted trans kids being her biggest fans at the time is not lost on me). As many of you probably know, this episode involves very obnoxious puppets singing about Snape only to be interrupted by a mysterious ticking which turns out to be a pipe bomb. Now, Potter Puppet Pals wasn‚Äôt exactly standard fare in our part of Texas and most of our peers were quiet bewildered by the two oddly dressed kids putting on very poor British accents and jumping around, but they were used to our strange antics at this point and payed us no mind. By the end of the third rendition of this annoying parody ear worm, we were allowed to enter the cafeteria.

About five minutes into the next period, the principal came on the aging PA system to tell us the entire school was on lockdown and teachers were to search every student‚Äôs bag. I think they might have brought in  search dogs as well but I could‚Äôve been combining this with another incident. I wasn‚Äôt too concerned as kids had brought in drugs before and was happy to bury my nose in my fantasy novel. At the end of the day, the school passed out letters for our parents explaining a student overheard two other students talking about a bomb and the school was placed on lockdown.

I quickly put two and two together, realizing someone overheard our little rendition of ‚ÄúThe Mysterious Ticking Noise‚Äù and reported it to a teacher. Apparently they either felt the need to finish their meager school lunch first or the lunch monitor couldn‚Äôt be bothered with it until the next period. I panicked, as I was generally an anxious kid and we were in the height of the late 2000s Zero Tolerance movement, thinking I would be expelled if anyone realized Jasper and I were the cause of the bomb threat. Jasper, being quite used to my angst, agreed to be sworn to silence until we graduated middle school, at which point he promptly told all the kids at writing camp much to their amusement.

TL;DR: My best friend ‚ÄúJasper,‚Äù and I got bored and re-enacted ‚ÄúThe Mysterious Ticking Noise‚Äù outside our middle school cafeteria, only for another kid to overhear and report us for bringing a pipe bomb to school. The entire school got shut down for a bomb threat and I spent the better part of a year worrying I‚Äôd be expelled",2,3,tifu
t3_kpd80u,TIFU by ruining my brother‚Äôs baby‚Äôs gender reveal,"This actually happened on New Year‚Äôs Eve, two days ago. My brother and his wife had done the anatomy to find out what the gender of the baby was, and the results were given to their friends. The gender reveal was a throw back to their wedding, NYE one year ago, where there was a balloon drop at midnight. The only difference this time around, the balloon drop invitation was only for immediate family, was at 7:30pm, and the balloons were going to be either blue for a boy or pink for a girl. 

Since only immediately family was invited, and there needed to be a way for the reveal to be shared with other family and friends, a video was taken of the joyous occasion. So, with a soon to be grand father as the videographer, the gender reveal could begin. 

Everyone counted down, ‚Äú3-2-1!‚Äù and my sister-in-law pulled the string to release the balloons. 

Black. 

The first balloons were black so as to hide the BLUE balloons that would follow so that nobody could peek through the opening of the balloon drop and know before anyone else. 

So, my dumb ass yells out ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs black!‚Äù announcing the color of the balloons we first saw. I was excited! And my filter doesn‚Äôt always work, unfortunately. 

Now my brother and his wife have a video of them revealing the gender of their baby and the fucking uncle shouting ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs black!‚Äù before anyone can shout ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a boy!‚Äù that they now have to share either their family because you just cannot recreate the surprise and expect it to be realistic.

t3_kpcz7h,TIFU by not showering with my best friend,"Obligatory ""not today"" this happened 9 years ago but I only realised today it was a fuck up

I (27F) was talking to my husband (28M) about the differences between girl friendships and boy friendships. Mainly we were discussing that girls are generally more physically affectionate with each other than boys are.

I decided to bring up an example about the best friend I had when I was 16 until 20: We would spoon watching films, hold hands, cuddle asleep during sleepovers etc. Then I mentioned we would practise kissing each other so we'd be experts whenever we kissed boys.

At this point my husband stopped me to say that that's not friendly affection. It's worth pointing out that I am bisexual so for some reason I somehow assumed he was saying I couldn't have been affectionate with my friend because of this. 

I began defending it ""No no it wasn't like that!"" and then went on to prove it by saying ""We even used to take turns showering together and the other would just chill in the bathroom chatting with us."" He was baffled by this and asked why. I didnt really have an answer other than whenever I was at her house, and we had the place to ourselves, she'd always want to try a new face mask or hair dye/product and while we initially would take turns showering she suggested we both just stay in the room to keep each other company. 

**ETA: I swear thought I'd mentioned this but apparently not! When she suggested the shower thing she initially said we should shower together to save water and time since we could help wash each others hair etc. I'd panicked and kind of babbled excuses about ""oh we wouldn't both fit and it would be just as quick to wait for the other to finish"" hence why we ended up sitting in the bathroom while the other showered then swapping**

I then pointed out she knew I was bi and I'd never wanted her to feel uncomfortable so I'd always made sure when she was showering to look away and if she asked me to look over for any reason I would completely maintain eye contact the entire time. Which to me proved it was nothing romantic at all!

I pointed out how difficult I found the entire experience because I'd had a massive crush on her and she'd always made jokes about how we didnt need boys because we had each other/ she wished we could just live together and make out all the time which just made the crush worse!

ANYWAY after some back and forth with my husband (who at this point was crying with laughter after I'd explained how hard it was to maintain the eye contact since often she'd ask me to look at stretch marks/freckles/ends of her hair) he finally got me to realise she was very likely trying to sleep with me and I'd been so worried about revealing my crush and ruining our friendship I hadnt noticed! 

TLDR was so scared of friend finding out about my crush I didnt realise she may have been trying to seduce me",39629,1869,tifu
t3_kpbe99,TIFU by saving a mole from getting hit by a car,"Of course, this was a while ago during the summer.

I work overnights doing refrigeration work for Kroger‚Äôs and such. One night on my lunch I was sitting outside, and this mole came up to me and nibbled on my boot.

The mole then heard a car passing, and freaked out; running directly towards the car. For some reason I had to stop it. So I waved down the car and told him to stop. Without even thinking, I picked up the mole to carry it into the grass. Well, we got to the grass, then the mole bit me.

APPARENTLY moles have diseases, and my mother asked me to go to the doctor to get it checked out. 
I got to the ER, and waited for an hour. Once I went in to see the doctor, he looked at my finger and told me it was fine, and sent me away.

$300 later, I‚Äôm mole disease free.

TLDR: saved a moles life and it charged me $300 for helping.",35,4,tifu
t3_kpart1,TIFU and almost killed myself by getting cum in my eyes,"This happened 2 years ago but I just was telling this story to a friend today and thought to post it here. 

My bf and I were having sexy time and he finished on my face. Now, I don‚Äôt know if anyone else has had this experience, but whenever I get cum in my eyes, it is like every sperm is swimming to the back of my brain and my eyes instantly swell up, turn BRIGHT red and start burning like they are on fire. Well as soon as he finished and his cum drenched my eyelids I knew what was coming. I shut my eyes hard and peeled my fake eyelashes off and told him to lead me to the bathroom so I could try to rinse my face off before it started... seeping in. Once I was in the bathroom, he left to go get dressed. I really didn‚Äôt want to open my eyes because it would be ten times worse if I opened them without rinsing them first so I just kept them tightly shut and I was feeling around trying to find the faucet handle. I hit something with my arm and heard it fall, but assumed it was a bottle of lotion or something. 
The sink was filling up and just as I was about to stick my whole face in, my bf walks back in and grabs me and yanks me back and says something along the lines of ‚Äúholy fuck I almost just killed my gf with my cum.‚Äù I‚Äôm very confused so I finally feel around for a towel to wipe my face off enough and open my eyes a crack to see that I had knocked my PLUGGED IN HAIRDRYER into the full sink and almost plunged my whole head in. I absolutely would have zapped myself, possibly to death. 

Now my bf tries to aim a little lower and I know not to ever leave the hair dryer plugged in. Had I died like that, it would have been pretty difficult for bf to explain what happened to the authorities... or my family!

t3_kpagug,TIFU by accidentally skipping in line at a Subway,"Today I was threatened in a Subway so I guess you could say 2021 is off to a good start.

As I walked in there was a woman standing outside and as I walked past her she told me she was waiting on an order. I think to myself ""Okay, cool."" and walk past her into said Subway. There is a customer inside that is clearly 6 feet away from the door as I enter, further confirming that this woman is not in line. As the customer finished their order and as I begin mine, said woman bursts in and howls ""Is she really ordering!?"" to which I, perplexed and wondering why this woman was acting like I had just kicked her dog, respond ""yes...?"". Enraged at this injustice, she shifts attention away from me and barks at the person behind the counter, demanding that they confirm she was in front of me, to which the poor employee responds by staring in bewilderment and awe.

I explain that it's a misunderstanding since I thought she'd said she was waiting for an order, not waiting to order, and I insist she orders first. Me being the unreasonable person I am, was expecting her to acknowledge this and go about business, like a normal person. Boy, was I wrong.

She responds by yelling ""Don't f\*\*\*\*\*\* tell me what to do! I swear to god I will seriously....!!(??)"". I did not want to die today so I did not inquire about what she would do. I've apparently already done the worst possible thing that anyone has ever done to her by trying to spitefully, and ""knowingly"" order food ahead of her. This woman had nothing left to lose. She continues on about how I have a problem with her. I insist there is no problem. As she continues to spew I, again, ask her to please order and she responds ""I WILL!"". Thank god.

As she finishes her order on the other side of the room I can hear her yelling at the unfortunate virtual bystander she's FaceTiming with about how rude I am and I would have reacted the same exact way if I were in her shoes (her very reasonable reaction). Yes, this entire time she has had earbuds in and is FaceTiming with someone and bellowing at them (in between ordering), demanding confirmation that they heard our conversation as I walked in and that I KNEW I was ahead of her and something about how I need to be okay with having her way or something equally sensical. I have to believe this innocent lackey agreed with her out of pure fear of becoming her next victim. She then made her exit.

Yes, me and my sandwich are safe.

t3_kpady8,TIFU by crashing a funeral,"A guy I work withs wife recently passed away. We aren‚Äôt super close but I do come into contact with him somewhat regularly and he has always been a very nice guy. I find out the funeral is today and decide to go with my wife. His wife was well liked and popular in the community so we knew the funeral would be very crowded. We have several high risk family members so we decide not to attend the actual service because of COVID so our plan was to wait in the parking lot for the service to end and just pull into the line of cars heading to the burial site. There we can catch him outside say we are sorry and go on with our day.

Everything was going great until the service ended. Everyone comes out. They put the casket in the car and suddenly everything starts to go very wrong. No one is lining up behind the hearse.... weird... suddenly a few minutes later the hearse drives off with no one behind it. No police escort nothing. So I pull out and start to follow it from a distance. It‚Äôs not going to the burial site it‚Äôs going somewhere else. So my wife gets on the funeral home website and confirms that the burial is taking place today and also confirms the address of the burial site. So we decide to drive by the burial site and see what‚Äôs going on there. We reach the burial site and a tent is set up chairs set out and everything. The burial is definitely happening today. 

We decide to go back to the church. When we get there everyone has left. Dang it. We‚Äôre very confused but we know the burial is happening today so we decide to go back to the burial site and just wait there to see what happens. 

When we finally get there the procession is just pulling in. The hearse is there cars lined up everything. Whew idk what happened but at least we made it. We pull in behind the last car and start to walk up to the funeral. Suddenly I reach the tent and a few people standing around it and realize I know no one there. About 80% of the people there are Hispanic. This guy is white and so is his whole family. I frantically look around for anyone I know and find no one. A crushing wave of realization dawns on me that we‚Äôre at the wrong funeral. I break the news to my wife. WHAT?! She exclaimed under her breath. Yeah we‚Äôre definitely at the wrong funeral I tell her. People are starting to look at us a little strange. This funeral is also a lot smaller than the one I was expecting to attend. We gotta get out of here she tells me. It‚Äôs too late now i reply it‚Äôs gonna start any second. We frantically talk bank and forth for a second and decide we should leave. We turn around and walk as quickly and quietly as we can back to our car and go back home to sulk in our shame. 

We eventually called the funeral home and found out after the fact that the burial was moved to another day and they didn‚Äôt have time to update their website.

TL;DR I didn‚Äôt realize the funeral I was trying to attend and been moved to a different date and accidentally crashed another funeral at the same location leading to massive embarrassment.",27,6,tifu
t3_kpac9s,TIFU by letting a jackal sleep in my bed,"So, yesterday morning, I went camping with my sister and our cousin. It was to a remote little cabin that the cousin's godfather owns, which mostly goes unused. Now, it's pretty far off from civilization - as in, an ideal spot to shoot a horror movie. The nights there are pitch-black, and you could quite literally die by just walking around after the sun sets.

Well, in the middle of the night, I heard scratching a the door, and went to check it out. For the record, we have no dangerous animals there. No wolves, bears or lynxes in the area, though they do exist in the country. The most you'll see is a deer or a fox. Even the boars live much further north.

So when I open the door, I see a cute little brown puppy there. It was really shy, but I managed to goad it into coming inside. I fed it, gave it some water, then took it to bed with me.

Woke up to my cousin screaming in the morning, outside. My sister and I immediately rushed to see what it is (the puppy was already awake, sitting at the foot of my bed). When we got outside, we saw seven jackals peeking at my cousin from the forest. As we were leaving the cabin, the puppy ran with us, and straight toward the jackals. Then they vanished, and my cousin and sister turned to me to ask wtf I thought I was doing.

Apparently, jackals don't live only in Africa. You learn something new every day. I deadass did not think they existed in Europe, let alone all the way in Croatia.

t3_kpa7ya,TIFU by asking a man-child to commit.,"I got to know this guy virtually a couple of years ago because of college projects and we got talking casually. We soon formed a pact where we wouldn't try getting to know each other's circle, and that whatever we discussed would be contained just between the both of us. 
This progressed really well and soon we were spilling out our secrets and stupidity. We met up in real and started dating. He asked me to be his girlfriend and I wasn't ready to commit at that point.

There was this brief break and soon enough, I just couldn't stop thinking about him. So I went back and asked him if we could atleast go back to being friends. Eventually, I gathered enough courage and asked him if he wanted to be in a relationship with me, the answers weren't exactly straight, but didn't give away that he wasn't interested. 

We lived considerably far away and meeting him was tough during the pandemic, not that he made an effort to meet. There were brief breaks in the interaction, I however thought that we finally had reached a point where it would be right to ask him to get serious considering the interest he projected. The conversation spiralled into a one sided blame game where he let me down saying I was the one who didn't seem serious. This escalated into something ugly and now we don't speak anymore.

I fucked up by asking too soon.

She is deep in conversation but all I can think about is splashing her with water. Here is where I fucked up: a contemplate the best way to splash her, I don't want to get her too soggy or she'll get angry so I decide to flick water at her... I stealthily move my hand down into the water and position my fingers to flick, I wait until she looks up at the bathroom window (obviously flicking someone with water is better if they aren't looking for some reason) and FLICK!!!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My parents paid for my student trip without realizing the conflict we would be experiencing over a year later. 

&amp;#x200B;

My fuck up started in the Spring of 2019; I signed up for an opportunity to travel to Washington, DC. I convinced my parents about the opportunity to travel there and began paying for my trip. My parents made the final payment in February of 2020, and I was set to travel in the summer; that was until COVID-19 became a pandemic. This led to the organizers to change the date from last year's summer to this year. Over months of being pressured about college tuition and fees, I called the organization to request a refund. One of their representatives informed me that I would receive $1,770 of the $2,005 I originally paid. She claimed the $235 they would be withholding would serve to pay for the insurance of the trip I never went on. Helping me on my behalf, my sponsor told me that she argued with a representative for 30 minutes, but they would retain the $235. My parents and I eventually decided to start the refund process with the organization. They informed me in an email that the process would initialize on December 9, 2020, with them depositing $1,067 into an inactive account and $703 in the other active ones. I called the organization again to ask them about the matter. One of their representatives advised me their system will send the $1,067 as a check in the mail while they deposit the other $703 into my active accounts. Since December 9, I have been checking my bank statements to see if the organization deposited my $703; they had yet to do so. I angrily call them a third time. The representative claimed the reason why it was taking longer than expected to deposit the $703 in my account was due to the ""banking process."" He concluded that it would take 5-6 business days to see the deposit in my bank statements. 

&amp;#x200B;

This shenanigan continued until I informed the Better Business Bureau about my conflict in mid-December. I then received an email from them a few days later with a response from the organization. The organization stated that they would deposit $1,770 into all of the accounts by Christmas, and they will send the $1,067 as a check. I ignorantly agreed to their proposition. I received the $703 into the two bank accounts, and I was waiting to receive the $1,067 in the mail; I did not receive anything. I angrily called the organization a fourth time and concluded that the $1,770 were successfully deposited in all three accounts. I was confused. One of my bank accounts was inactive because my original bank was bought by a bigger one. I then went to my bank to informed them about my situation. But they were unable to help me. One of the bank tellers told me that the supposed ""inactive account"" was not tied to their systems. It was a preloaded debit card instead. She informed me to look for the preloaded debit card because she was sure the $1,770 were deposited there. After notifying my parents, we scavenged for the card. The search continued for a week. This search lasted until today when I was in the kitchen planning on making hamburgers. My sister walked in, and my mother told her to update the dry erase board calendar. She agreed and began looking for a spray bottle. While in the process, she found three debit cards on the floor. She informed my mother, and she told her to hand them to her. My mother then found the missing card. She provided it to me to check the amount on it. To my surprise, I finally located the $1,067.

t3_kp8ze0,TIFU by creating a yeast bomb,"So yesterday I decided to prep the batter for some blinis (basically savoury pancakes). Hadn't made them in years so had to look up the recipe. Its pretty simple. Get some lukewarm milk, add yeast, add flour, let rest in the fridge overnight. So I did.

Happy with the result of mixing it all together, my eyes fell on a liter sized airtight jam jar with one of those hinged lids. poured the batter in, man was it satisfying to se it fit with barely any extra space to spare. I closed the lid tight and put it on the top shelf of the fridge.

Now you see this recipe contains yeast. On top of beeing this ball of active bacteria it has this other nifty feature of making dough expand. It does this by generating gas in it (carbon dioxide I believe). This small feature I forgot about was about to be my downfall.

I had dinner with my gf, and then we went out for a walk. On coming back we planned on some Netflix and chill. As such, about an hour post blini storing, I open the fridge to get the dip.

When adding gas to a sealed container, you get pressure. Clearly at some point while out, that pressure became to much and the lid of my jar was blown of. As such The sight I was greeted to was like a male Narwhale with a fridgefetish had come to visit. Runny goopy batter everywhere. And as we all know shit flows downwards, the batter had first sprayed, then overflowed the top shelf, poured down and overflowed the middle shelf, bottom shelf, and finally into the vegetable drawer, naturally covering everything in the fridge while doing so.

As you might expect, cozy time was delayed by a couple hours of me cleaning the fridge. In the end I was left with around 3 dl of the original 1 liter of batter still in the jar. Thankfully my better half was at least gracefull enough to feel sorry for me.

After throwing them in I noticed some very some shiny threads on my black shirt, which I didn't think much about until later. after getting my sheets and mattress cover out of the dryer I went ahead and put them on the bed and proceeded to lay down. Shortly after that I begin to start feeling an itch, followed by another itch, followed by several dozen more. After some investigating and guesswork I realized that someone had the ingenious idea to put a thin cover over the foam mattress that seems to have been made of/ contained fiberglass. This cover was hidden under the factory mattress cover, and as I took off the mattress cover a lot of fiberglass went with that and spread through all of my sheets. today I am at work with probably hundreds of little fiberglass needles all over me because I can still feel them. I don't know how to fix this issue, and there is a chance I am out a set of sheets and a mattress cover.

When I was around 16, my girlfriend at the time told me that she never played Habbo (or Habbo Hotel) when she was a kid. This shocked me, as all my friends and I used to wile away countless hours on that game, so I resolved to show her what she was missing out on. We both made accounts (I couldn't remember my old account from when I was a kid), and jumped into the game, both sitting in our own houses. Here's where the FU happened.

Apparently, they don't take too kindly to people asking that question in a game made for children. A few minutes later I was kicked out of my account, and a message popped up telling me I was banned for, if memory serves, 21 years. On top of all of that, my girlfriend didn't even like the game.

The lead singer of my favorite band posted on Facebook that his former guitarist was going solo and he was wishing him luck. Not thinking that anyone from the band would see my comment and hoping that a fan would reply to my comment, the following took place:

Me: ‚ÄúAt the risk of looking like a moron, I need to ask...I‚Äôve been to 40+ shows and I‚Äôve never seen this man. What am I missing?

Former Guitarist: ‚ÄúSomewhere in there, you must have missed all the shows in 2016 and 2017. I‚Äôm also pretty skinny, so, I may have just been turned sideways.‚Äù

t3_kp7c4l,TIFU by taking a morning walk and looking stupid,"Okay so my husband is out of town right now and it‚Äôs just me at home. My sleep schedule is kind of a mess when he‚Äôs gone and so I couldn‚Äôt even fall asleep until about midnight last night. I woke up just after 3am after having a nightmare and I couldn‚Äôt fall back asleep after that. 

Well I decided to take a shower and relax for a bit but I have really been wanting to work out since I haven‚Äôt been to the gym for months now (cause of our good friend rona...). So I decided to go for a nice walk down to the grocery store and back which is about a two mile walk, perfect for sleepy me! I live right outside of a Capital city and that typically means there‚Äôs a lot of fun characters looming around at night and it‚Äôs best to be safe when it‚Äôs dark outside. I dressed in baggy sweats and a loose hoodie which I had the hood pulled up and scrunched on so that nobody could tell I am a young easily beaten and robbed scrawny gal. If it were during the day I wouldn‚Äôt have gone through the effort but it was almost 6am and still completely dark outside and I was very comfy like that. 

So I get walking and it was a great brisk morning!! I was totally vibing to my music and just having a wonderful time waking up. Well when I get towards the store I came across the first person I had seen. He was just some average guy and I didn‚Äôt think much of it. As I got closer I pulled up my mask from my chin to over my nose and mouth just to be considerate and safe. Well it was chilly outside and the mask made my glasses fog up so much that I couldn‚Äôt see anything. 

Next thing I know I run smack dab right into one of those cord things connected to a power pole. I half way spun around and almost fell down and it nearly knocked off my glasses. I made a very loud ‚ÄúACKKK‚Äù sound and stammered off to the side of the sidewalk to collect myself and let the guy pass. When I took my glasses off and got the fog off and looked back up I noticed that he has passed 5 LANES TO THE OTHER SIDE JUST TO AVOID ME. Note that we were very close to a stop light so he could have crossed earlier but only did so after seeing my debacle. He just saw this random dark figure run right into a pole and yell and he was like ‚Äúnope‚Äù and dipped. I was SO embarrassed I wanted to yell after him and say i‚Äôm not on drugs i‚Äôm fine but omg I died a little inside after that. I know it‚Äôs not the biggest FU but man was I embarrassed lol. Other then that it was a wonderful walk and I am probably going to make it a recurring thing!!

t3_kp6exe,TIFU by going to work,"So I(f17) am in and out of sleep every night, no idea why. I do take melatonin gummies, have been for a couple weeks. I can sleep for 4 hours, sometimes, and the rest of the night I wake up all the time and cant sleep. That's the first problem.

Then I get up out of bed for work at 5:50, really been up since 4ish starting at the ceiling. 

Roads in town are slick as hell an I live in the country so dirt roads suck even more.

So I head to work and I get there at 6:23, usual time I get there. I realize I dont have my key card to clock in. 

Around 7:30ish i think, I am cutting up meat for the kielbasa for lunch. I split my left ring finger open through my glove and I was bleeding, I saved the meat from the blood. I called my coworker over because I needed a bandaid. 

I'm wierd here. I am a hunter. I can do blood, guts, bones, you name it, from animals and humans. I cannot do my own blood, I knew that already. There wasnt a whole lot of blood coming from my finger, but enough to be gushing out. 

So I am doubled over the trashcan next to the sink in the kitchen, I am the cook in an assisted living, while my coworker wraps my finger up. I'm dizzy as f*ck and trying to not pass out or throw up. I couldnt hear shit, everything was so monotoned and low sounding, I could hear clearly, but it was super low if that makes any sense. 

After 10 minutes of that and me finally getting water down, I'm able to stand up straight. Awesome. I still had to serve breakfast to everyone lol. 

Later, I'm about half way done making lunch when we run out of our clear gloves. All we have left are latex gloves. A couple weeks ago, I figured out I'm allergic to latex when i have hives breaking out so bad i cant move my fingers. Awesome. I'm also sweating enough that the bandaid wants to slide of my finger. 

So i get home around 2:15 and i look for my card. Cant find it anywhere. Not inbetween the seats, under them, in my glovebox, nothing. I'm looking for a solid 15 minutes before I fin that my card is stuck between the back and bottom part of the seat. 

When I found my card, my pants ripped at the thigh. Awesome that is the second pair of work pants to do that to me this week. It's a good thing I just bought 2 new pairs for work. I guess my pants cant take my thick? thighs.

I also purposely ditched my car on my way to work three days ago so I would avoid hitting the car in front of me. 

I am at home currently eating a bag of popcorn listen to hair bands from the 80's at 3pm. Greatest music ever.

t3_kp5u5f,TIFU by helping my students focus their microscopes without realizing I needed an eye exam,"By ""today"" I of course mean a few years ago. I was a teaching assistant for a college biology course and one of the lab sections involved looking at slides under a microscope. It's surprisingly hard to find the right focal plane through a compound microscope if you've never used one before, so I showed several students how to.

Now, these are the sort of microscope that have two eyepieces that can be focused separately, so if your eyes have different prescriptions you can still have a good binocular image. I did this myself for a few of the microscopes and basically said ""okay, you should be good to go with this one"" to the students.

A couple months after that course ended, I was (for some reason) talking about eyesight with a friend. I've never worn glasses; AFAIK have never needed them. My friend jokingly asks me to cover one eye and read a sign across the room. I did and...couldn't read the sign at all with my right eye. Turns out I've had an astigmatism most of my life and never realized it because my left eye is fine and compensated for the right eye. So when I was ""helping"" my students focus each microscope eyepiece separately, I was just badly screwing up their view through the microscope! It never came up on my teaching evaluations, so hopefully I didn't lead them too far astray.

TL;DR I didn't know I had an astigmatism, so when I helped my students focus their microscope eyepieces separately, I was actually messing it up for them.",93,10,tifu

So I accepted that I would wait until she left and put some porn on the iPhone and get it taken care of. I play sleepy, kiss her and tell her I love her, and wait for the door to close.

It just happened that a few days prior to that I was reading about Schwarzenegger on the internet and it turned out that his last name means black ridge or whatever.

So I dcided to tell them that Schwarzenegger did not mean __that__, and meant something else, and for some reason the stupid teenage me thought it would be ok for me to say the N word because I am not a white American dude and a friend of that guy...

So I say ""Hey man, Schwarzenegger does not mean Black N..., it means black ridge"", and the guy says what?

And I said it __again__ because I thought he just didn't hear me.

He then asked me to fuck off before he beats the shit out of me, even though I immediately started apologizing, because I didn't actually call anyone that, I just repeated his words.

After he said this I was freaking out, because holy shit it sounded exactly like a rattlesnake and there was nothing else I could think of that could make this noise. It happened again 5 mins later.

After a while of my bf convincing me that there are no rattlesnakes in Canada and that it was probably the furnace making that noise ~it most definitely wasn‚Äôt the furnace~ I somehow fell asleep and did not hear the noise again.

t3_kp32ao,TIFU by spitting mucus directly in someone's face,"This happened multiple years ago. When I was younger, my school took the entire class on a week-long trip to an island via ferry. A couple things to make the story make more sense: 

a. This trip was the literal highlight of the school experience. Everyone in the lower grades looked forward to it, this wasn't something you wanted to miss

b. Even though this was pre-covid, they were very strict about making sure that no one going was sick. They had everyone do temperature checks before even getting on the boat, and did not at all hesitate to send people home early 

c. I was sick :D

Okay, so on to the fuck up! I showed up to the boat even though I had a pretty bad cold at the time. By that I mean coughing, hacking, and constant spitting up of wads of mucus. I passed the temperature check by the skin of my teeth (I was actually a bit too warm, but since it wasn't by much they let it slide). Once the boat actually starts moving, it becomes clear that this was a shit idea because it turns out that *being on the freezing cold deck of a ferry in early March while sick* is a horrible fucking idea. 

So I'm on the open deck, freezing my ass off, and my nose starts getting really stuffy and stopped up. I do that thing where you kinda suck all the mucus into your mouth, and I'm sitting there with my cheeks full of phlegm while I try to figure out what to do with it. 

And then in all my glorious stupidity, I decide that the best to get rid of all the slime would be to spit it over the side of the boat while it's in motion. The wind then picks up the huge ass wad of phlegm, carries it a couple of feet down the side of the boat, and proceeds to deposit it directly in someone's face. 

There's an immediate shriek and people start freaking out. A bunch of people start surrounding the unfortunate soul, asking her if she's okay while she's trying to wipe the mucus off her face with her sleeves. Once the girl's calmed down, everyone involved is trying to figure out where the humongous loogie came from. Meanwhile, I'm silently panicking because you can *tell* from the color of phlegm if someone is sick, and I'm just waiting for some teacher to drag me below deck to call my parents and send me home. 

No one found me :) And that poor girl has yet to know that I'm the one who spat in her face that one time.

t3_kp239b,TIFU by squirting 90% isopropyl alcohol directly into my eye,"Obligatory disclaimer: this happened like 5-6 years ago or something. 

Back story: I was working in the ER at the time, and had several syringes of sterile normal saline at home, which I brought from work. I mostly used these to clean the scratches I would acquire from indoor/outdoor cats (originally feral then domesticated), and I would fill some of them up with isopropyl alcohol after using up the normal saline, as a way to conveniently clean wounds with alcohol (as I learned shortly after, it's not necessary at all to clean wounds with alcohol). I'm mildly allergic to cats as well but they're so goddamn cute and I can't help but love them, so figured I could just deal with cleaning the minor scratches.

  
I come home one morning after working a night shift. One of the cats had diarrhea'd on the carpet, so I brought out the stain removal cleaning solution. It was jammed, and upon trying to fix the cap, I accidentally sprayed it up into the air. I thought I got some in my eye, so I removed my contact immediately and grabbed a normal saline syringe to irrigate my eyeball. I put the syringe up to my eye and felt a tingle, so I thought, ""ah, definitely got some of that stain removal in my eye, better clean it out with some saline.""

It just happened to be the ONE syringe that I put alcohol in. 

My eyeball immediately began to burn intensely and I proceeded to rinse my eye out with regular tap water out of panic. It felt like I was doing it for 5 minutes but probably not. I walked over to my roommate, who was sleeping, and asked her to drive me back up to the ER where I worked. 

I was treated with antibiotic eye ointment, as well as some tetracaine for the pain. Sent home, and for days I was in excruciating pain and fear, unable to sleep. I went to the eye specialist in the next couple of days (this happened on a Friday night so the specialist was not open over the weekend) who informed me that I burned off about 3/5 of my cornea. He had to physically shave off the remaining lips of the cornea so he could smoothly apply a bandage contact which I would keep on for 4-5 days. 

Somehow, I never suffered any permanent damage except for a bit of emotional trauma. I thought I was going to be blind in my right eye. I'm fine now though. And I have since learned not to replace NS with alcohol, and not to clean my wounds with alcohol.   


TL;DR - thought I was irrigating my eye with normal saline but it turned out to be isopropyl alcohol, burned off 3/5 of my cornea, had days of non-stop pain and no sleep, but I'm all G now.",43,7,tifu

-

I'm South Asian and our pickles are more than veggies in a pickling liquid. There's a ton of spices and oil and other things that make up a paste, then you add your veggies to it. They make a really good accompaniment to a lot of things.

Today I tried the western style of pickling on some chilli peppers that aren't very hot/spicy (by our standards) and they turned out delicious. I loved it so much that I ended up eating the whole batch (about 15 whole chillies in total) in a span of 30 minutes. I love spicy food and since this was not spicy at all, I was unaffected.

Or so I thought.

An hour later I rush to the toilet to take a dump and felt as if I was literally shitting out lava. My butthole burned more intensely than a thousand suns and every bit of poop that came out was painful as all hell. Towards the end the poop didn't even feel normal. Once I thought I was done, I stood up and turned to examine my handywork in the pot.

I had shat out whole chillies.

Thank the lord for hand held bidets (also called bum guns). I unleashed a jet of cold water in and around my butthole to calm it down to a level that no longer felt like I was using a piece of hot coal as a buttplug.

t3_kp1cu1,TIFU by Trusting Macrame,"In the great tradition of this sub, this happened today, if by ""today"" we mean back in the 80's....

It is a warm summer day.  My brother and a couple friends, ages 12-15, are bored AF.  We think maybe climbing trees could be good, a common pastime as we are half-monkey and our neighborhood has plenty of climbable trees, but we'd climbed each a hundred times.  We are looking for something new.

*We yearn for adventure.*

And there it is, right across the street--a great, majestic oak, growing right next to the road in an undeveloped lot full of trees, bushes and myrtle.  You can see exactly how to climb this glorious monster--go from that lowest branch to that branch to that branch....  Problem is, that lowest branch sits 15' off the ground.  Now there is another tree kind of next to the oak, a tree with a relatively thin trunk and no branches until way up, perfect for shimmying up like a pole.  But, perhaps intimidated by the majesty of the great oak, it kind of leans away from the monster we want to climb, and by the time you get high enough to be on level with the great oak's branches, the pole tree leans too far away for the oak to be reached.  We'd tried.

But none of that matters today!  For today is the day **that oak shall be conquered!!**

What we need is rope to get to that first branch, so we dive into my friends' garage.  Now, this two-car garage hasn't housed a car in years, it's so full of junk.  We are looking for rope but will settle for something rope-like, maybe one of those 100' long orange extension cords or something.  Finally, my buddy calls out, ""I've got it!"".

I turn to look.

He isn't holding a rope, or an extension cord, or clothes line.  He is holding a [macrame plant holder](https://www.wescover.com/p/macrame-wall-hanging-by-stephanie-echeveste-at-private-residence--PHJnuQBcAU).

Now, if you don't know, macrame is basically knotted yarn.  And if you don't know, the 70's were a crazy, confusing time.  Along with disco, drugs, bell-bottoms and porn 'staches, one of the archetypal artefacts of the 70's were these macrame plant holders--you'd have a long trail of macrame ending with a big tassel hanging from a hook in your ceiling.  But it didn't end at the hook--it would gracefully make its way to another hook.  And if it was special, it'd proceed from there to yet another hook.  If it was extra-special, it might then proceed to yet another hook in the ceiling.  From there it would descend into a knitted basket in which you put your plant.  That is what passed for home decor in the 70's--a giant yarn rope hanging from multiple hooks to hold up a plant.  Don't do drugs, kids.

Anyway, my buddy had found an extra-special, yellow-green macrame refugee from the 70's that was at least 50' long if it was a foot.

""Dude, that's not rope,"" I reply.  ""That's friggin' yarn.  There's no way macrame is going to hold our body weight.""

""Yes it will!  It's strong!  See?"" he says, pulling on it.

We argue a bit before I tell him fine, I'll show him it won't work.  We toss the plant end over the majestic oak's lowest branch, the others brace themselves holding onto the other end, and I put my foot in the plant holder loops.  Amazingly, it supports my weight.  Not wanting to get halfway up and it breaking, I jump up and down several times, trying to snap it.  It holds!

**We are going to conquer that oak!!1!**

Excited to be the first one up the tree, I put my ass in the sling and the others heave me up.  There I am, 15' up, my chest against the lowest branch, and... I can't figure out how to get my ass out of the sling and onto the branch.  I decide that we need to redo this with me standing in the loop rather than sitting so I can step out of it, so I turn my head to the other three to tell them this.  But at that moment, a funny thing happens.  All three fall backwards onto their asses, as though they'd been pulling hard on something that had just snapped.  How strange....

Next thing I know, gravity happens.  You see, oak has very rough bark.  And while the yarn had (surprisingly enough) had enough strength to hold my weight, as my friends had hauled me up, that yarn had been dragged across the oak's bark, shredding it....

Having been in a relaxed sitting position, when I start plummeting earthwards, my knees come up to my chest, and I find myself plummeting towards the ground basically ass-first.

""Man, this is going to hurt when I land,"" I think to myself.

I am wrong.  Agonizing pain sets in while I am still falling.

Remember that pole-like tree that leans slightly away from the oak?  My back starts sliding down it, its bark lifts my shirt up to my neck and the bark starts tearing off the skin on my back like a cheese-grater with serious anger issues.

""Aaaah!"" I say.

But then another, horrifying thought occurs to my pain-addled brain:  that oak is right next to the road--am I going to land on earth or cement??  I look down, see that the road is a couple feet over from me, so at least I'm not going to land on cement....

Turns out, I am wrong about that too.

You know those cement cinder blocks used in construction, like two squares of cement pushed together?  And you know how it's practically a law of physics that the broken end of one of those things will randomly show up wherever nature and man are in close proximity?  Well, the tree that is tearing up my back changes the trajectory of my fall just enough so that my tailbone comes crashing down onto one of those square cinder block ends which had been stealthily lying in wait under the myrtle at the base of the tree.  Hitting that unyielding cement, the vertebrae in my back all violently slam together at once, agony blossoms across my back with such intensity it completely eclipses my shredded skin, and I fall over to my side and then onto my back with the wind knocked out of me more severely than I'd known possible.

There I am, lying on my back staring at the sky, completely deprived of breath, and it's not going away--my lungs are so seized up, time is passing and *it's not starting to fade away.*  I start panicking, fearing that maybe I will suffocate and die before I regain my ability to breathe. I see my friends circle around me.  ""Dave, are you alright?  Dave, say something, are you okay?""

I desperately want to tell them no I'm not okay, call 911, but I'm so wracked with pain I can't move and I still can't make a sound.

One of my friends grows irate with me.  ""Dave, we can see your eyes moving.  We know you aren't dead.  Quit playing dead and say something!""

How can I get him to realize that I'm not saying anything because I can't breathe?  The edges of my vision are starting to get dark, and I'm really panicking.  I focus every ounce of will I can muster, focus it on my breathing, and with the mightiest effort of my life, I desperately try to draw in *some* amount of air into my lungs.

There is the slightest movement, a tiny puff of fresh air enters my lungs, and my throat makes a high-pitched squeaking sound as that tiny puff of air enters my lungs.

Those assholes start laughing at me!  I'm dying and they're laughing!  I'm so mad I try to draw in another breath so I can yell at them, my throat makes another squeaky ""eeep"" sound and they literally fall to the ground laughing their asses off.

Slowly, torturously slowly, my ability to draw breath returns.  My back is in so much agony I wonder if I will ever be pain free again, and I limp home and crawl into bed.

Fortunately, a couple days later and I am fully recovered.

TL;DR: I entrusted my body weight to a macrame plant holder designed to hold like 20 lbs and it went even more catastrophically wrong than you would have imagined.

Epilogue:  Believe it or not, I have 100% successfully managed to avoid entrusting my health and well-being to macrame ever since, and I heartily encourage you, dear reader, to do likewise!

Things start getting steamy and I decided to let my husband hold my hair for added sexiness. I don't normally let him hold my hair and control the pace because I have a horrendous gag reflex. So as we continue on he's super into it and I keep having to back off to avoid gagging...

And then he grabbed my head and finished into my mouth.. At the exact same moment he came...I threw up into my mouth. So in a panic with penis, semen and vomit in my mouth, I just swallowed it and practically flung myself off him coughing and gagging. When he asked if I was okay, I explained what happened and apparently he didn't notice. But I noticed...and still have a stomach ache 10 hours later.

TL;DR: tried to give my husband a sexy birthday surprise and instead of just swallowing what I was planning on I also swallowed vomit and gave myself a stomachache.",104,22,tifu
t3_kp0jpq,"TIFU by ignoring warnings from another tifu and getting scarred for life on another subreddit, as well as puking on my cat.","Tldr at the bottom. This actually happened about 10 days ago. I was scrolling through Reddit, and I saw on my recommended posts ‚ÄúTIFU by trying to look for r/eyebleach‚Äù. I clicked on the post. Basically, the writer was looking for above subreddit and misspelled it as ‚Äúeyeblech‚Äù. I was skeptical, so I checked and presto! It‚Äôs a real subreddit. Being a teenager, my curiosity got the better of me, and despite multiple warnings the author of the post gave, I clicked on it. I have never felt so sick in my life. After 2 minutes of scrolling, I was drinking soda, then landed on a particularly nasty one. I choked, then puked ALL OVER my cat that was sitting on my lap. He didn‚Äôt appreciate that, and was so startled he left 2 inches long scratches on my thigh. 
TLDR: didn‚Äôt listen to warnings about a subreddit and saw a picture of a leg missing most of the skin and muscle (visible bone) and puked over my cat, who proceeded to scratch up my legs. 

Edit: unless you have a strong stomach, do NOT check out the accidental link to the subreddit I put in. 

Edit 2: This is LITERALLY a warning. It‚Äôs rather disturbing how many people are like me and just click it anyway. At any rate, at least I‚Äôm not the only one... 

Edit 3: I removed the hotlink, hopefully the time it takes you to start looking for it is time enough to change your mind. Read the comments if you‚Äôre curious guys. 

Edit 4: This has actually become the most successful post I‚Äôve ever made. It beat a post on my old account in 2019 of me getting superglue on my fingers and trying to cut it off with a knife. I still have the pictures. If enough people want the story, I‚Äôll post it.",289,147,tifu
t3_kp0hbm,TIFU by being drunk and touching my friends inappropriately,"So this was at new years eve and im with my friends having a good time. And the night had quite the good of an ending. The day after i thought it was mostly fine and dandy. That was before i spoke with my friends...


They quickly reminded me of what I had said which instantly made me want to claw my eyes out of embarrassment. Several times I told them how much I wanted them, I even told one of them i wanted to put my little friend in them. 


And if that wasn't enough I had also touched them quite inappropriately, trying to get my hands on their nether regions. 


I feel so bad right now I do even want to exist. What I did feels so horribly wrong and disgusting. Im never going to live this down. This will follow me into the grave. 


Even after all of this I'm also kinda relived it was with them and not someone else, for I could easily been beaten or thrown out. Thankfully they laugh at it now but I still feel so bad about it I want to rip my heart out.

t3_kozqs6,TIFU by trying to live a better life.,"So today I royally effed myself over with the best intentions.

I‚Äôve been a happy sack of laziness past week or so (thanks for the excuse Christmas!) but yesterday decided that I must get back to some semblance of a normal life, come this morning. 

I woke up and cleaned my house, did laundry then I decided to do some meditation/yoga which I usually do a few times a week, in normal life mode. I‚Äôve got an achy back about 80% of my life and overall it makes me feel much better. Suspiciously I wasn‚Äôt really aching at all and didn‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù to do it as such, just wanted to.

TL;DR Long story short, I tried to do something good for myself, FAILED and have not been able to turn my head since that fateful moment this morning.

t3_kozgmm,TIFU by stealing my friend's sister's panties,"My story is so ridiculous, idk if you guys are going to believe it.

I   was staying at my friend's house across the country and her sister was   gone, so she and the family told me to sleep in her room. I thought  that  was really weird to be sleeping in her bed, but whatever I guess.  Well  on the day I left, I woke up and I was all groggy, i had a hard  time  sleeping and I didn't fall asleep until 2 am or so, woke up at  4:30 for  my train, and I go over to open the drawer to get the shit I  stored,  well I opened the wrong one and I didn't notice cuz I was all  groggy and  the drawers (idk if i translated it wrong) looked the same.  The drawer I  opened was her underwear draw and opening it caused an  open container  of some lotion cream shit to spill on the underwear. It  looked like  jizz. I freaked out, I tried washing it out, and I couldn't  get rid of  it, if anything it made it worse. There was no fucking way  people were  going to believe what happened, thankfully it only spilled  on one pair  of underwear and all of her underwear looked identical.

I   took the underwear, stuffed it at the bottom of my backpack and I  left,   I felt so guilty. I go to my girlfriend's house and she opens my   backpack to do my laundry and she found the pair of panties. She asked   me WTF this was, started accusing me of cheating and shit. I explained   myself and she realized I was telling the truth because I can't lie  for  shit, she sees right through it if i ever try to ever joke or  anything.  I'm also kind of a clumsy dumbass so this isn't unbelievable.  She is  however upset that I won't return the underwear. I don't want  to return  it, I just want to throw it away and get rid of it. There's  no way  they're going to believe me when I tell them the story, and the  fact my  girlfriend has her panties makes it worse. She won't tell me  where she  put them. She's telling me I need to tell them what happened,  and she  won't give them to me until I tell them. I'm pissed at my  girlfriend and  we got into a massive argument over it. I eventually did  find them and I  burned them. My girlfriend lost her shit over that  saying how precious  panties are to girls or some shit. These wern't  expensive ones either,  it was clearly the bulk type you'd buy 20 for 10  euros or the ones you'd  see for sale in the sketchy tunnel ways or  next to train stations,  right by the kebab shops, the knife/military  gear stores and the soccer  jersey stands.

My girlfriend have been fighting over this, and I feel guilty about it, but I think not telling is the best coarse of option.

t3_koypv5,TIFU By calling 911 on accident,"So I‚Äôve had a few drinks, *its a little early in the morning for me but that‚Äôs for a different subreddit* Anyways, I was sitting in my room chillaxing and sipping on some Smirnoff ice, playing Mario 35 on my switch lite having a ball. I‚Äôm listening to music on my phone and the volume is really inconsistent ( the songs are all playing at different volume levels ) and I‚Äôm consistently turning up and down the volume using the side buttons. I do this for a bit but in the middle of it all I guess my phone gets turned around and I end up pressing the power button multiple times (iPhone), anyways there‚Äôs a feature on iPhone that dials 911 if you press the power button a certain number of times. Something tells me something is up so I look at my phone and the emergency sos 911 screen is calling me and my heart shits its pants, holy shit I‚Äôve called 911. I hang up and hope nothing happens but alas they call me back. I have an awkward phone call with a very sweet 911 operator who has to ask me questions for safety reasons, Is this your phone number, address, name and if I was being held against my will. I drunkenly explained my mishap and she had a good giggle to start the morning I‚Äôm hoping. I‚Äôm still shaking from the sheer anxiety of this fuck up.

t3_koxg9z,TIFU by finding a lifeless body while breaking in a school illegally,"so as in every post, this happened several years ago. i will try to keep the story as short as possible

so me and a friend have the great tradition of breaking in a school once a year. we use to go into the school in the evening, then hide in two lockers until everyone left. then we usually have a great time by ourselves drinking and eating snacks. 
there have been a few occasions, where really crazy stuff happened, but the wildest one is this: 
we just came out of the lockers and wanted to start the party. as we walked down the stairs to get our booze, we saw what we thougt was a dead boby outside the building. to give some context, it was nighttime and winter, so dark and cold af. we are at that point kind of panicking. we cant call the police and tell them where we have seen the body??
so we put a little stone between the door, so we can come in again later, bc we had all our stuff in the school. we go on the roof of the school, where you can go to even when the school is closed. luckily, the body is also visible from there, it lays like on the edge of the roof, but not a roof where you should go, like further down. 
so we call the police and tell them we saw a body. a few minutes later, the police, firemen and an ambulance arrive. they get the 'body'. its a boy, around 14 years of age. he is drunk af, cant respond to them and has a broken collarbone and is under normal temperature. 
they take him to the hospital and begin to ask us stuff. we lie a lot bc they ask us why we are here, where we have seen him etc. they even brought a detective, who should ask us seperatly, so were in a reeally dumb situation, bc we didnt talk about an alibi. 
so we tell them that we really wanna go home, were so tired etc, and they let us go. all the police cars etc are standing right in front of the door we put a stone in between... in a brief moment, we sprint to the door and run inside again, where we drank ourselves to sleep

so yeah turns out the boy was drinking with his friend. his friend fell asleep, meanwhile he fell down the roof. his friend wakes up, cant see him and decides to go home, what left the boy in the cold, asleep/ unconcious.

moral of the story: something a little illegal can save someones life!

TL ; DR i broke in a school, saw a liveless body out of the window, on the roof. had to lie to the police a bit, then snuck inside the school again and drank booze

t3_koxakz,TIFU by comforting myself,"This happened just then. I was playing fortnite with my mate because we were bored and had nothing else to play. It's really humid where I live right now, so with male reproductive organs, things got really uncomfortable. So I'm comforting myself, doing what I'd assume all boys would do in hot whether, and without a warning my dad walks in on me. He instantly goes apeshit at me and tells me to go to sleep, so I think he assumed the worse. It's pretty blatant if he does assume the worse since I've told both my parents I'm asexual, but if he tells my mum I was doing something alot worse, than I'm fucked. I know this may be a fairly boring story to read as opposed to others on this sub, but thank you if you've read this far. I'd love to hear if a similar thing has happened to u guys, and I'd love to hear how u dealt with it/what the consequences were. Thanks.

t3_kownvy,TIFU by getting a UTI after I just cleared up my last one,"A little NSFW. 

Using an old throw away account for this and obligatory ‚Äúthis happened yesterday/last night‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on mobile‚Äù. 

So to preface this, I got my first UTI when I was 19 (now 25) after messing around with a guy on a beach trip. We got handsy after being in the water and all that nasty bacteria caused a problem, and now I‚Äôm prone to them. They‚Äôre easy enough to manage and prevent, but it‚Äôs never 100% full proof prevention. I was able to prevent them for a good long while through proper hygiene and making sure my partners washed their hands and such beforehand, but sometimes you just forget in the heat of the moment. Anyway.

I got a UTI about a month ago after being with my boyfriend. I hadn‚Äôt had a problem with him beforehand, but this was after we had gone out for my birthday dinner (covid restrictions were lessened at the time). His food was a little more hands on and in retrospect, I should have made sure his hands were clean when we got home. He‚Äôs also weirdly adverse to simple foreplay? So he doesn‚Äôt use his hands often but of course this was one of the rare times he did and well, I felt that telltale tingling sensation afterwards and took an at-home test to confirm my suspicions before calling my doctor and getting antibiotics. It cleared up within a week and all was fine. 

Flash forward to yesterday.

I spent NYE with him and had no problems. We got food the next morning and spent the better half of the day together. Once again though, food was involved, and he went down on me. Plus, I was licking my own fingers to provide a little extra slick when touching myself so between his mouth and mine after we had eaten, I‚Äôm not surprised. Just disappointed in myself lmao 

I woke up this morning close to 2am with the urge to use the bathroom. Not like, ‚Äúah shit my bladder is going to BURST‚Äù but like. ‚ÄúOh. Oh no. That‚Äôs not a good feeling.‚Äù I still had leftover at-home tests from my last UTI so I used one and lo and behold, it came up positive üôÉ I‚Äôll retest in the morning to make sure, but I know my body and I‚Äôm already dreading the call to my doctor to get another antibiotics prescription. Not the biggest fuck up but damn, you‚Äôd think I would know better by now. Great way to start off the new year.

TL;DR: I was lax on proper hygiene before sexy times and now I‚Äôm paying for it after having just dealt with a prior UTI. What‚Äôs Reddit‚Äôs favorite saying? Something about stupid games and prizes?

ETA since people think we‚Äôre filthy: I know my bf washes his hands and did so before we got started after the birthday dinner. When I said I should have made sure they were clean, I guess some people think I should have used a microscope to find every last piece of dirt under his nails. I know he washed his hands, but I‚Äôm not his mother and I‚Äôm not going to stand there and make sure he scrubs for a full minute. I trusted that his hands were clean since he‚Äôs a hygienic person, but I guess that‚Äôs my fuck up too.",12,33,tifu

t3_kow12r,TIFU by telling my MIL she‚Äôs the reason her son has crippling depression.,"
When I met my husband in our early 20‚Äôs he was the love of my life. We quickly eloped and started our life together. He changed a year later right after we got a computer. His self care became infrequent and he became depressed. He‚Äôd game up to 21 hours a day and stopped working. We went to counseling and he admitted that he‚Äôd always neglected his self care growing up, tried to get out of going to school and doing any kind of work. He said when he wanted to date he changed to be outgoing and it worked. 
The root of his problems were from being raised by a hoarder, just like the ones on TV, plus too many animals.
He has a younger brother who came out of the situation seemingly unharmed. Of anyone I‚Äôve ever known, him and his wife have the ideal life. He can afford for her to stay home and they raised their 3 boys into great young men who are now in college. They live in a stunning spotless home and are the center of hundreds of people‚Äôs social circle. Completely involved parents, coaching, team mom, PTA, musicians, travel. Just the best people. 
My husband hasn‚Äôt much improved in the last 20 years. He receives treatment but the only situation it alleviates is his anxiety, it doesn‚Äôt make him any more productive. 
His mother is up in age and needing help with shopping, appointments and lifting. Because we live closest, that‚Äôs been our responsibility for several months.
While driving her yesterday, she was venting about how my husband isn‚Äôt as helpful as she wants him to be. She wants to go out shopping several times a week and he‚Äôs only helpful with the necessities. Then she made a comment that she thinks one of my nephews is going to turn out just like him because he‚Äôs been too busy to take her shopping to (a 4 hour round trip) Without thinking, I responded ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs ridiculous because he was raised way better‚Äù She got wide eyed and defended herself saying that my husband was helpful before he met me, but I know that‚Äôs a lie. I saw what she raised him in when we met, and no one was doing anything in that house. I tried to backpedal and say I meant my nephew was raised by 2 parents. She then asked me if I had a problem with single mothers? We were silent the rest of the ride. 
Still waiting for the family drama but maybe she will self reflect and not tell anyone. 
TLDR My husband has severe mental illness from being raised by a hoarder. When my MIL mentioned she believes my nephew was going to be just like him, I told her it‚Äôs not possible because he has good parents.",92,17,tifu

My work collegues and I went out of town. We wanted to travel and take fancy photos so we went to this amazing retreat house where the view is breathtaking. As we were walking, we passed by a coconut vendor and decided to buy for each of us. We had the coconut juice to drink, some of em cannot finish it right away so they had to put it in a plastic to have something to eat and drink along the way. We were so happy and laughing like crazy. Suddenly, I felt like peeing prolly coz of having so much coconut juice and laughing too hardb but restroom is nowhere near us. One of my colleagues was playfully running as she wanted to have that stolen kind of effect on her pics when a dog started to chase her. And just like that, I couldnt stop myself from laughing so hard I started to feel my pants getting warm and wet. The struggle of trying to stop the piss when it already started dripping is so real and so damn hard. One of my colleagues witnessed how my pants slowly got wet and I didnt know whether to laugh or cry at her horrified reaction and before I knew it I already have all four of them surrounding me to cover me and my wet pants. I was wearing light red pants so it was pretty obvious that it was wet and it was bc of piss. I didnt have extra shirt nor pants. Good thing, they were all good enough to make me borrow their stuffs. One of em, sprayed alcohol and perfume all over me, one of em made me use her jacket to hide the wet spots and the other gave me her shirt to change as well.

I thought I should eat something not too heavy (had mashed potatoes and salmon to eat later for dinner) to just see if it settled my stomach. Big. Oof. 5 minutes later I'm throwing my face mask on. I can feel it coming, the stomach did not agree with my executive decisions. Hands down a 0/10 rating. As I'm speed walking out of the room to the bathroom, it begins. I manage to make it out the door but its too late. I give props for my mask for being impermeable because the contents of my stomach stuck in there well. So well, in fact that I couldn't breathe and without thinking I take my mask off in a panic, causing everything to spill on the ground and then, I take 2 steps and another wave hits me. I finally made it to the bathroom but there was really no point now.... so I had to scrub that all out. Now there will be 2 huge stains in our hallway, right in front of my bosses office.

t3_kotlwh,TIFU by drunkenly getting lost in a new country with only a backpack full of stolen broken glass.,"Much like many stories here, this didn't happen today, but about 6 years ago.

In college when I studied abroad, after the second day of exploring our new neighborhood, my classmates and I decided to stop by a pub to well, get sloshed. There were probably a couple dozen of us together that filtered in and out of the pub, and since it was already a popular place, it was hard for us to pack in at once but we finally made it. It was a really cool Irish pub (not in Ireland) with normal high tops, booths, a bar, and an upper deck area that looked down onto the main seating area.

A few of us claimed a high table before downing several rounds of Irish Car Bombs (sorry) along with shots and of course a few pints. After we were all a bit tipsy, my klepto friends and I in all our glorious drunkenness, apparently decided that the Guinness glasses they used were really, really cool, and it would be a good idea to take some for souvenirs. They had to be ours. We were nervous about getting caught by the staff nearby, so we had to come up with a plan to not get caught taking any.

So this glassware heist was a classic four-man job. Two lookouts on the sides blocked the camera and a barkeep's lines of sight. I, the mastermind and wheelman, would reach under the table to hold open my backpack (cut me some slack, I was basically a tourist) and the 4th was our burglar, who would set an empty glass in the bottom when the coast was clear.

We repeated this process until there were, I don't know, maybe 7 or 8 glasses in my bag. The only problem was, to keep getting glasses we had to keep ordering beers to drink, not to mention we only took maybe one glass of every 4 so we wouldn't have an empty table. So obviously we were even farther gone by this point. The person who was taking the glasses had to go de-beer, so another friend of ours sat down in her seat. We explained the plan to him, and he somehow convinced us that he in fact was *not* too drunk to help us. Very comforting. But when all of us were ready, I opened the bag and he held a glass above it. Then suddenly... *SMASH*. He just dropped the fucking glass instead of gently nesting it into another one. So here I am, drunk, surrounded by a bunch of other drunks, with a backpack full of broken glass. Obviously I couldn't just dump it all out, so I decided I had to get out of there. I paid my tab, snuck out, and started walking home.

Then I realized I had no idea where I was. No idea where ""home"" was. No map, no cell phone with service, no idea what my address was. It was my second day in this country, and I didn't even know the language! Even if I could have talked to a local, I wouldn't know what to ask them. I wandered around for what felt like an eternity, but finally found a street that looked familiar, and followed it until I found my building, by some miracle. I stumbled inside, dropped my backpack, and passed out.

When I came to the next morning, memories of the night came flooding back. I checked my backpack and, as karma would have it, it was completely soaked with the smell of stale beer and full of shards of broken glass. To add insult to injury, I found some paperwork that could have guided me home, and that too was soaked.

I felt really guilty about it all, so I somehow mustered up the courage to return to the bar and gave them some money to cover the glasses and a bit more on top. They thought it was sort of funny and appreciated me covering the damages, even though I'm sure they were more angry than they let on and judgemental about me, a stupid tourist, pulling that shit.

We all ended up going back there regularly, but they either never seemed to recognize me after that, or maybe just didn't care.

t3_kot9qt,TIFU by scaring the shit out of myself and burning my pp and hitting my head,"This actually happend like an hour ago. English is my first language however I am an idiot (as I will now prove)

It was about 0530 am and I haven't slept in about 24 hours now due to the whole ""one more episode before bed"" fiasco. I haven't eaten for about 9 hours so I decide to go downstairs and have some canned macaroni cheese before my stomach wakes the whole house up. 

For some much needed context I park my motorbike outside my front door even though it has been stolen twice from that very spot. I am also only wearing boxers and socks.

Once the bowls in the microwave I start cleaning the can out and hear some noises outside but chalk it up to a mixture of me being tired and the JD I had 4 hours ago to help me sleep quicker. 

I get my bowl of piping hot macaroni and carefully carry it towards my room but as I'm passing the front door I hear some more noises. So I creep up to the door to look through the window and dont see anything. In my infinite wisdom I decided to turn the light on behind me then have another quick check out of the window at my pride and joy. 

I look back at the window and about 6 inches away from the glass is a shirtless, homeless looking guys tearing into my very soul. Naturally I shit myself and slip backwards on the smooth floor, hit my head on the floor and manage to spill my macaroni cheese on my crotch which went straight though my boxers and really fucking hurts.

I rush to the shower after ripping my boxers off to try to cool my junk down and it is then that I realise that I got so scared of my own reflection that I managed to hit my head on the floor, burn my manhood and loose any pride I once had.  TIL: I need a fucking shave

TL;DR made macaroni cheese, went to investigate noise with macaroni cheese, saw my reflection and shit myself then subsequently mutilated my manhood and wasted some good food",241,17,tifu
t3_koswnl,TIFU trying to brew apple juice," 

So I live in a Muslim country where nobody can't even think about brewing and stuff. So I bought some yeast, juiced some apples and put them in a 500ml water bottle. I live with my parents and grandma, nobody suspected a thing. At first I was burping it every 2 hours and such, and it was really fun to watch. However this being my first time I thought I can just burp it after I wake up. So I woke up, excited to see the big burp. And there it goes, the bottle exploded like a damn bomb spilling everything everywhere. I underestimated this bottle thinking It's a small one and I didn't have to make holes or need balloons with a pinhole.

So here I was nervous about everything just happened, my parents and grandma came running to me what happened. They were surprised I didn't drink the apple juice yet, and immediately my grandma asked me by any chance if I was brewing or not and I couldn't speak. So that was the fuckup, and I don't know what comes next. Hopefully we never talk about it ever again.

I have always made a calendar reminder to donate blood, and when my reminder came up I scheduled via the Red Cross app at the closest place that was available.  

I didn‚Äôt really think much of it and just went to the place.  It turned up to be a local military base.  I mean, I was allowed to enroll for donation, so again didn‚Äôt think much of it after the restricted entry sign and continued on.   After parking in the lot, didn‚Äôt see any obvious signs or the Red Cross truck, pedestrian gate was open, so I wandered around a bit until I stumbled upon a holiday party and asked someone where the donation area was.   They directed me to a garage area in the back.

Here's the bad part. I cropped out the time from the top of the picture so she specifically couldn't see that I screenshotted it 40 minutes ago. Well she ended up saving it so she could draw a line around his hairline to point it out. Well apparently when she saved it, it shows that it was saved at 12am instead of 12:40 right when I sent it. I ended up saying that I waited to send it cause she was ""busy"" because she was signing up for a test. Now I feel like she thinks I'm a stalker. I was just getting used to talking about my crush with her and now it feels like I'm back to square one.

t3_korktu,TIFU: I got my boss for Secret Santa.,"
He told me (not knowing I was his Secret Santa) that this was his first ever ‚Äògift exhange‚Äô. I felt like I had to make it count. We all had to fill out a paper saying ‚Äúwhat color you like‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your favorite thing‚Äù, etc. So I got his paper. He likes a specific candy, a specific beer, and what not. He‚Äôs had literally the same mask this whole pandemic. So I wanted to get him a new one! 


In my Etsy order, I got him, my husband, and myself new masks. All are black. My husband has a ‚Äúlarge‚Äù. My boss and I got the same size ‚Äúmedium‚Äù. I have bought the mask that I‚Äôm getting for my boss for both my husband and I multiple times. I think this mask is super comfortable, as far as masks go. I decided I wanted a different mask. A cute ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù mask that‚Äôs different, but from the same company. It‚Äôs a lacy black mask. Same shape, same everything. 



The company that made the mask folded the lacy part on the inside. Honestly, with USPS going the way it is, it took longer than expected to get to my house. I even told my boss on the 26th that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm his Secret Santa and to not worry because it‚Äôll come in soon‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt want him to think he was forgotten on his first gift exchange. Anyway, I got him his favorite chocolate and his favorite beer. And his mask. 



Turns out, I gave him my lacy mask. And I guess kudos to him, he wore it for a couple days. He showed it to me (and others) on a video conference. I literally couldn‚Äôt see the lace on it so I was like ‚Äúoh this is great! He likes the gift I got him!‚Äù. Well luckily one of the other managers saw the lacy part and told him ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt really pull off that look‚Äù. He said this I think a couple days before my boss switched back to his old mask. Anyway, he told me today that his mask looks like ‚Äúunderwear‚Äù and the other manager was constantly telling him this. 



Needless to say I immediately went home (how on earth could I work the rest of the day knowing my boss thinks I got him a lacy mask?) and got the other mask and swapped it out (I have a winter mask I‚Äôve been wearing, so I haven‚Äôt worn the new one yet). He likes the new one! 

TLDR: I got my boss a lacy black mask for Christmas and he wore it because he‚Äôs nice and because I got it for him.",624,66,tifu
t3_korbm5,TIFU by sending nudes underage,"So awhile back I (16M) joined a discord server, and someone from the server gave me a girls Snapchat who lives a few states away. And after a bit we got a bit intimate, including photos, and a few videos. After about 2 days I realized how stupid I was being, and I told her that I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable anymore, and asked for just a regular relationship without that, and I asked her to delete the photos/videos I sent, like I did with hers, and she promptly blocked me.(nothing had my face in it). A month or so later, I was peer pressured into sending a photo to 2 other people, most likely my age, and I found out that one of them spread it to others around the server, and then I left. Now, I‚Äôve spoken to everyone involved with the second scenario, and we‚Äôve cleared it up, and it‚Äôs clear they don‚Äôt care about it anymore, but I‚Äôm still scared of getting mildly successful, and the girl/people finding me, and spreading it.

t3_koq691,TIFU by dropping my airpod into my shit filled toilet,"So around 20 minutes ago I was using my airpod pros on the toilet as one does. I then proceeded to take a dump, a massive, laborious one might I add. No seriously, I might as well have had a midwife help me deliver this thing. Anyhow, while on my phone during said dump, my right airpod fell out of my ear and took a dive towards the toilet. I somehow miraculously caught it in an awkward position between my thighs, but it was in such a way that I pretty much had the airpod pinned against the inside of the toilet seat. Now, as you can imagine, there was practically no way to save the poor thing as there was no room to stick my hand in between my thighs and grab the airpod. So, I hoped, prayed that somehow I could grab the airpod when I pulled my sweaty thighs apart from one another. However, to my horror, the airpod took a plunge into my shit filled toilet. Without thinking, I shoved my entire right hand wrist deep into the toilet and fished the airpod out from a cozy spot laying in between two turds. At this point, I took practically a gallon of hand sanitizer and proceeded to drown the airpod like it was a prisoner being interrogated inside Guantanamo Bay. I made sure to remove the exchangeable tip of the airpod and replace it with a different one that better fits my ear (so I wont have a future disaster on the toilet). It made a loud beeping sound for a little while after, but I let it dry and now it still works fine, no issues so far. I can still feel the sploshing feeling my right hand felt as it nobly sacrificed its poop virginity fishing my airpod out of the toilet, even after washing my hands like fifteen timea. Thankfully, its a bathroom in my own room and im the only one who has used it for over a year now.

t3_koq5ai,TIFU by grilling salmon which nearly caused our house to blow up and then scaring my cat into running away.,"Tldr; Family was grilling salmon on an old grille which caught fire and nearly blew up, the resulting chaos caused my cat to flee into the night and we haven't been able to find him.

My new year has admittedly not started off as I would have liked, it's been outstandingly shitty to say the least... there's some comedy involved here but honestly a new wave of sadness which is kind of overriding it so please bear with me. 

This evening my dad was grilling some Salmon on our old outside BBQ, it's a sturdy piece of equipment that we've used many times over the years and we've never had a problem with it, until today... while my dad was grilling away I was playing Wasteland 3 in the next room over I heard a loud WOOSHING sound, instinctively i turned around to see what it was and I saw a huge jet of flame that had just singed the hair clean of my dad's forearm and partially burned his hair. My dad and I both looked at each other in absolute shock for a moment before he ran in and we proceeded to make sure he was okay, turns out he was fine other than a bruised ego and a few missing hairs. I half jokingly stated that we should stay the fuck away from the grille... I wish we had never touched the damn thing in the first place. 

My dad then returned outside to make sure that the grille was okay. It was not okay. The goddamned propane tank was on fire. It's worth noting that we live in a house which is connected to another neighbors house up in the hills, if that tank had exploded it would've severely damaged not only our house but also theirs and it also could have really caused us some severe injuries. My dad starts screaming to get the fire brigade and to get water to extinguish the fire, so I sprinted up the stairs, filled up a huge jug of water and called 911 in the other hand (was rather impressed with my ability to do this while freaking the fuck out). They said they'd send the fire service right over and I just prayed to God that this would all be resolved sooner rather than later.

My family and I quickly evacuated the house and got as far away from the brewing explosion as humanly possible, we then alerted our neighbor (who probably thinks we're insane now) to the possible danger and that she should probably get her family to a 'safer' location, she's got elder relatives who live with her so now I felt like a huge asshole. The fire guys turn up and quickly extinguish the flames, but in the commotion we had left our backdoor open... this was a mistake. We have an adorable cat called K2 (he's a Himalayan blue) and he's a huge wuss, so when he heard the commotion he sprinted out the back door into the velvet backdrop of the night, out of sight and out of mind. We couldn't locate him and we still can't... we also live in an area which is full of Coyotes. So in the space of 24 hours 2021 has nearly burned my house down, blown my family and my neighbors the fuck up and possibly caused me to lose my goddamn cat...that saying about starting as you mean to go on better be absolute horseshit or I swear to God.",8,10,tifu

Today we also ran out of toilet paper and my mom was at work so I told her to buy some on her way home (she did)

But anyway I had to pee and decided to use my stp. Everything was fine. Then I decided to just go ahead and hop in the shower and clean it in there. After I cleaned it I set it down on the side of the tub and got to my usual shower business when my mom came home with my younger sister.

t3_kopn2h,TIFU by eating sugar free mints,"So, I was running around with my parents so I can help get them some things for their house. We were at one of those checkout lanes that have little shelf‚Äôs full of random crap. Well I saw a bag of sugar free lifesaver mints. I absolutely loved those kind of mints, but whenever I got them, they weren‚Äôt sugar free. I got two bags.

As me and my parents were going to other stores, I‚Äôd take a handful of mints and eat them while we were walking around. Eventually I had eaten a whole bag.

For you more clever readers, you may know that sugar free candys can act as a laxative, my dumbass forgot about this important fact.

When we got home, I remember feeling gassy, of corse I only got gassy when I was about to poop.

I sat on the toilet, had a normal poop and continued with my night.

But then I felt it again, and it was worse, thriving pain in my gut, I felt a rush of liquid in my stomach. I ran to the toilet, and once I sat down, it was like a full on bodily evacuation of fluids. All being held in by a solid poop plug.

As soon as I had turned into a pressure washer, my guts writhed in pain, basically pushing out everything it could as fast as possible.

For a bit of context, when I get ‚Äúthe runs‚Äù i shit once, feel fine, I clean up, go back to what I was doing, then it all comes back and I‚Äôm on the toilet again.

This was the same, except i had about 5 min to chug a glass of water and immediately go upstairs. Repeat this 5 times and you can imagine the pain I was in. The last time I had to go, it was awful, full body shakes, a fucking geyser is coming out my ass, as soon as it was over, I crawled to my shower, turned it on and just sat there, exhausted, processing everything I ate that day, wondering what the fuck I ate, then it hit me:

Those

Fucking 

Mints

I washed up, got a new change of clothes and waddled to the other bag of mints, I read the back, and of corse, in big letters on the back, ‚ÄúWARNING, EATING EXCESS OF THIS PRODUCT MAY ACT AS A LAXATIVE!‚Äù

I read this as I sat there, sweating, eyes sunken in, white as a sheet of paper, knowing how truly stupid I was, especially since I heard about the cursed gummy bears.

So now I lay in bed, exhausted, cursing death on the dumbasses who thought putting things in candy that act as a laxative would be a good idea.

t3_koo9hd,TIFU by letting my mom discover my c*m sock,"Obligatory this happened 3 days ago. When I beat my meat, I like to use a sock because it is the least messy way to enjoy myself. Because I don't want  to have the smell spreading through my belongings, I prefer to leave it in an open (but kinda hidden) place, mostly under my bed. My parents never enter my room for any reason other to say dinner is ready or stuff like that, so there hasn't been a problem so far.

 A few days ago I had to go run some errands that would take a pretty long while, meaning I wouldn't be home for at least a couple of hours. Take in mind that said sock was under my bed at the moment, because I never expected someone to actually look beneath my bed. After I completed the tasks I was given, I enter my house to find my dad mopping the floor, which was odd to me, because we always vacuum the whole house before mopping. I enter without giving it much thought and go to my mom's bedroom to tell her I've done what she told me, and she said she vacuumed my room while I was absent and my dad was going to mop it later. I freeze thinking about the surprise under my bed and just say thanks and run to look if it's still there. It is, but it was in another spot . My mom is very meticulous when cleaning so I'm 99% sure she found it and just put it back to where she thought it was and never said anything to me in embarrassment.

One of my (18M) best friends' (18F) family came over for New Year's dinner and since we were the only kids and weren't in the mood to talk with a bunch of asian adults, we went up to my room to chill on my computer and talk about random stuff.

Fast forward around two hours she gets the idea of me doing the rice purity test online. I had never heard of this before but she just told me to take it while she turned around. I begin the test expecting it to be a test of how much of a stereotypical asian I am, but turns out this was.... different.

I ended up taking the test really fast as out of the 100 things listed I had only ticked 6, giving me a score of 94; seemed normal enough? I had never been in a relationship before and I figured most people would get above 85 or so.

Well, I then turned around and told her to do it and you can probably tell where this is going.

She was taking the test and while I was minding my own business, I noticed the mouse clicking a little bit over 6 times, and I'm thinkin' what the hell on that list she was ticking. She finished and got a score of 76, meaning that 24 of those... interesting things on the list she had actually done.

Now for most people this would be pretty normal as she's 18 and can do what she wants, but for me this came as a shock as she's actually really holy and mature in person, talked about waiting till marriage before sex, etc.

Now I wouldn't actually go out of my way to try and discover what she put, as once you submit the test the score pops up and you cant go back. Knowing this, we finished and I just exited google chrome.

Fast forward to the end of the night and her and her family left, I jumped back on my computer and realised that I hadn't finished a youtube video, so I decided to Control + Shift + T on my keyboard and.... the tab that had her test opened back ON THE LIST, not the final score. What she put was just right in front of me. I knew I fucked up when I scrolled through what she ticked, and now I can never see her in the same light again. Turns out she'd given and received oral sex, had unprotected intercourse and some other not so normal things. She doesn't know I know but I think she knows somethings up by the way I'm texting her... so yikes.

t3_konnf2,TIFU by breaking down during one of my practice drives for drivers ed,"About me (16M): I‚Äôm a very shy and introverted person and whenever I meet someone new, I can get very bad anxiety depending on the atmosphere around them. I also had a major depressive point 2 years ago where I tried to end it all but didn‚Äôt due to guilt of leaving my friends and family. Since then I tried to work on my self-esteem and worth and was starting to feel happy and proud of myself again until COVID hit and all that progresses started to regress.


Background: I started driving classes about 1 and a half months ago. Due to covid, we had to get our drives in after taking our zoom-class due to their office being backed up with people from earlier classes. Eitherway during this time, I started asking my parents to help me learn how to drive. By the time my first drive came around, I‚Äôd learn the basics on driving and despite being nervous, I kept a ok-ish composure and did ok. I‚Äôm a very shy and introverted person and whenever I meet someone new, I can get very bad anxiety depending on the atmosphere around them.

Today was my second drive and I met the guy (40-ish  M) that would be instructing me on my second drive. It was raining pretty hard so the weather was kinda shitty. I had already got some practice in beforehand, but I also started working at my aunt‚Äôs place and she would drive me and my cousin to work so I couldn‚Äôt get any practice in for a week. When I met the dude, his voice and demeanor was off. He sounded annoyed and a bit aggresive (wouldn‚Äôt blame him, he taking me out to drive on New Years Day). I instantly felt nervous around him. 

As I got into the car, I started to turn on the engine and he told me to ‚Äúcrack the windows down‚Äù to get some circulations into the car. Me already being nervous around him, I didn‚Äôt know what he meant by the ‚Äúcrack the windows‚Äù and asked to clarify. He replied back to lower the windows down but in a way where it sounded like as if I were stupid. Or that was the way my brain interpreted it. I started to back out of the lot, and thought I should check my side mirrors first to see if anyone was behind me since the heavy rain made the rear window very obscure. When I started to slowly back and was about to turn my body so I can see through the back passenger window, the dude stepped on the breaks and asked me if I knew how to back. I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing wrong, so I told him yeah I knew how to back. He said ok but in a doubtful way and let go of the breaks.

At this point, I started to feel extremely nervous and uncomfortable. I continued on and tried backing out again but I became anxious and forgot to look where I‚Äôm backing and the guy stomped on the breaks again and started to condescendingly tell me a tldr version of how to back. At this point, I knew I hated this guy but I don‚Äôt know what happened. I started to internally fight with myself with one half saying ‚Äúkeep going, your just uncomfortable‚Äù while the other half said ‚Äústop you obviously suck at this‚Äù. I always had a self-esteem issue and whenever I start to doubt myself, I overthink and forget key ideas/objectives. 

Fast forward to the most stressful 10mins I had in awhile. I made rookie mistakes after mistakes. We never even left the parking lot as he told me to drive around, proceeded to question whether I was ready or not to do this, asked why I was acting so nervous if I drove already, and asked if I lied about the hours I drove with my parents. In the end, I told him today was not my day and I would like to reschedule on a different day with someone else. I went out to my dad‚Äôs car and just basically broke down while trying to make it so my dad didn‚Äôt notice.

The worst part is when the guy asked if my problem was him, I didn‚Äôt say anything. I just took everything, sucked it up, and gave him answers that he wanted to hear. I didn‚Äôt even try to even defend myself or why I did things the way I did. I felt like a poor defenseless child again. That alone, was worse than everything that I experienced during that ‚Äúdrive‚Äù. I thought I could finally face my fears after all this time but I guess not. I‚Äôm just hoping by writing it all out here, maybe I can feel a bit better and try to figure out of all the stressful situations, why was it this one that made me break down so badly.

 I thought it would be great to take a dip in my hot tub and drink a beer to start the end of the year. It was around 6pm and it had just gotten dark. 
  
  I went out and started to lift the lid off of my hot tub (keep in mind its dark outside) i decided to just fold the lid in half and leave the other half covered. It took me about 30 seconds to do.

 When i finished flipping the lid the ants started biting my hand. I tried swatting them off and they started biting my feet. I jumped into the tub to try to get them off. This is when the real pain began. I was covered in ants from head to toe. They were in my swimming trunks. Like alot of them. The ants had made a nest between the cover and the hot tub. When i had opened the cover they had covered me, but they had started falling into the hotub as well. So when i jumped into the dark hot tub i jumped into a layer of ants trying to get off of the surface of the water as well.

  I ran inside screaming in pain and stripping naked to try to get them off of me. The inside of my trunks were covered.

My wife and i quit counting at 20 bites on my genitals. I probably got bit 70 times and  my entire body was tingling. I took 4 Benadryl and took an oatmeal bath to try and subside the pain. I was asleep on new years eve by 8pm. 

 Today when i woke up my entire body feels like I‚Äôm wearing a super itchy wool onesie and my junk feels like a feverish mess.


Good bye 2020 good riddance


Tl:dr.  This year sucked. I tried to get in my hot tub on new years eve but there were a fuck ton of ants in there and they wrecked me.",22,15,tifu
t3_konga7,TIFU by getting creampied,"Tifu So to set the scene, my s/o and I are having a lazy day after the new years festivities. We've been laying in bed all day fried, and she suddenly decides she wants a chocolate creampie. So naturally the puns were flowing all the way to the store and back. We ate like half the pie and the jokes started to lead into intimacy. Cut to I'm butt ass naked and she gives me a playful push onto the bed, and my ass landed right in the creampie. I never took it off my bed. So now I'm just laying on my belly, frantically trying to clean pie creme out of my ass crack. after all afternoon of making creampie jokes, I didn't know that i would be the one to get creamed lol. It was hilarious, but that out an end to that for the evening. I gotta post it on here because it's a little TMI to share with my friends or roommates. The new year is really bringing something new.

Tldr: while making sexy time and joking about creampies, while eating a creampie, I accidentally sat on it and creampied my bare ass

Update: I ate the rest of it. Waste not, want not",381,65,tifu
t3_kon8rn,TIFU by causing an intergenerational food fight,"This actually happened a few years ago, but it got brought up again today and I thought it would fit in here.

I (30M) live with my girlfriend (31F), ‚ÄúSandra.‚Äù Back when this story happened, Sandra lived in a house with seven other women, ranging from early 20s to late 50s. The 20 year olds would often fight with the 50 year olds over who got the best seats at the dinner table, who got the best spots in the pantry‚Ä¶ stuff like that. Well, when my girlfriend moved in, she thought this was absurd, so decided to write a document outlining some general behavioral guidelines that everyone could agree upon.

A bit of backstory: back when Sandra and I first started dating, she played a trick on me. She changed my phone settings so that certain words autocorrected to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big poo.‚Äù I‚Äôm not the most careful about rereading things, so I ended up sending this to a bunch of different people. It was all in good fun (though embarrassing), but I knew I‚Äôd need to plan some revenge somewhere down the road.

This roommate situation seemed like the perfect opportunity. Sandra had written up a document with some very reasonable rules (things like ‚Äúno fighting over the dining room chairs‚Äù and ‚Äúeveryone gets an equal amount of space in the pantry‚Äù), and I decided to sneak in and add some stuff when she was in the bathroom. I put in a few rules like 

* ‚ÄúNever speak to anyone in the house without texting them first. Under no circumstances should you try to contact someone if they‚Äôre in their room.‚Äù (Sandra is an introvert, so she would actually prefer this!)
* ‚ÄúIf you have a disagreement with someone, you must settle it by trial by combat. If you‚Äôre too scared, you may nominate one (1) champion to do battle on your behalf.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúIf someone steals your food, you are entitled to dump an equal amount of food on the offending party‚Äôs head (but the food must be relatively fresh, no decayed matter).‚Äù

Turns out Sandra was actually done with the document and didn‚Äôt reread it before signing it and sending it out to the roommates. They all signed too, and Sandra was excited because she thought things would be better in the house from then on. 

Unfortunately, soon after the document was sent out, there was another case of food stealing. This led to one of the 50 year old women throwing a bowl of leftover chili onto the head of the 20 year old who she thought was the thief. Sandra said ‚Äúwhat the fuck‚Äù and then everyone got mad at her since she had ‚Äúmade up the rule.‚Äù Once she figured out what had happened, she obviously blamed the whole thing on me. 

TLDR; Edited my girlfriend‚Äôs roommate contract to include humorous rules as a prank. As a result, a woman got chili dumped on her head. My bad.",13,1,tifu
t3_komvky,TIFU by paying too much attention to my BFs shirt,"This actually happened yesterday but it‚Äôs hilarious and I don‚Äôt really want to share with this with people I know IRL: 

My BF was away for a week to see his family (in our COVID19 safety bubble) for the holidays. We were laying in bed catching up and one thing led to another and I started going down on him. 

We were just starting out so he still had a shirt on. His shirt was Vault Boy from the video game FallOut giving a big thumbs up. Now, I have never played FallOut before but I know about it since it‚Äôs pretty popular. Unfortunately, I know enough about it that as I am giving him that sexy eye contact during the bj, I kind of notice the Vault Boy and the thumbs up. 

I guess i wanted to fit in with the Vault Boy cause my horny brain decided to give my BF a huge thumbs up while I‚Äôm deep throating his pole. When he looked at me all confused I decided to very confidently say: 

**I am the Vault Boy. I live underground**

Bless him he tried to keep a straight face cause I literally said that and started blowing him again. When I realized what I just said I laughed until I cried. I was still eatin dick tho and laughing crying and choking all at once. 

Needless to say we had to take a sexy time break and now he won‚Äôt stop telling me I‚Äôm his vault boy. 


TL;DR; got cock blocked by the vault boy from FallOut",26759,503,tifu
t3_kolpdg,TIFU By Nearly Killing My Entire Family With Carbon Monoxide,"So, this happened today:

We have a pretty large older style farm house out in the country, and a small wood stove to heat the entire house. Which means we load this thing up with split wood all day and it works wonders. However, recently we bought a couple cords of wood, which has appeared to be very wet and has been a real struggle getting to light. Me, in my arrogance today was like ""Gee, why don't I just go and squirt lighter fluid all over the wet wood and that should work?"" Well, I did just that. Went out to my shop and grabbed some, a good amount too. Shot a bunch on the wet wood and it actually appeared to work well. I was so proud of my new-found 'hack', I went and told my wife what I had just discovered. She was like YOU CAN'T DO THAT IT'S NOT SAFE, and I'm like why are you freaking out? I'm sure it's fine. So, thinking she's completely over-reacting I google it and sure enough... I'm very, very wrong. Doing this can release a host of extremely dangerous chemicals as well as carbon monoxide which as you know can not only be fatal but is odorless, tasteless, etc. I wasn't conservative with the amount of lighter fluid I poured on, either. I squirted that stuff on like I was getting ready to burn a building down. As this is going on, (me reading up on it) I'm in the living room which is next to the wood stove (wood stove is in kitchen) and I'm starting to become extremely dizzy. Now I'm freaking out thinking I have carbon monoxide poisoning. I look up signs of poisoning from carbon monoxide and sure enough, dizziness was one of the first symptoms so now I'm freaking out, thinking I've just let a dangerous cloud of this gas take over the house. I run outside, trying to take deep breathes and intake as much fresh oxygen as I could. 

Fortunately for my wife and kids who were in a different room, no one seemed to notice or be affected other than I. I also checked the Carbon Monoxide alarms in the house (none in the kitchen where i was exposed) and all was well. This could've ended much much worse than what happened and I'm very thankful my stupidity and arrogance didn't kill me. learn from me! Lighter fluid is ONLY MEANT FOR GRILLS! NOT FIREPLACES OR WOOD STOVES.

I'm not exactly sure what I was thinking by this, I think it was one of those moment were you're like ""nah dog, it's cool."". 

TL;DR Almost took out my entire family with carbon monoxide by shooting a ton of lighter fluid meant for a grill in the fireplace to try and get the fire going. Carbon monoxide was released and I got so dizzy I had to step outside. Had I poured more the entire house would have been a death zone.",78,9,tifu
t3_kolcdr,TIFU lying about my porn Twitter,"TLDR: GF found Twitter account that I follow &amp; like girls posting sexual stuff. I get defensive and lie about it, then admit everything. She wants to leave me, losing trust in me and feeling used.

So I may have a slight porn addiction idk. But basically I‚Äôve recently had a mini relapse into my twitter account where I followed people who post and like their photos. My reasoning is I like it and show them support so they continue. I also use this account for those giveaways where you retweet and like posts. 

So my gf who likes to stalk my exes and stuff‚Äôs social media because he‚Äôs insecure and somehow made it a hobby, was on my phone doing her normal surface level lurk and she found that Twitter was logged into an account and she stopped and later asked me about it.

Essentially I admitted to it, but lie that I haven‚Äôt really used it recently but mostly for giveaways. And I‚Äôm getting defensive because this isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôm proud of. I‚Äôve always told her everything though, but how would i ever fit in ‚Äúoh I have a porn account‚Äù into a conversation? 

I probe her to ask how she feels: betrayed? Disappointed? And she asked me to bring up the profile and looks how recent&amp; often I‚Äôve liked photos. She‚Äôs not upset cause more recent and looks. She‚Äôs distraught telling me I ruined her trust in me since I tell her I‚Äôm tired everyday. (I work but trying to learn/start up a side hustle). Also saying I‚Äôm ruining her self confidence, something I‚Äôve been trying to build with her, and she feels used like sex toy. Now I admit I am attracted to her. The ‚Äútwitter girls‚Äù are different than her, but I‚Äôve never held her to those standards. I honestly prefer her body type, but I do get turned on by the ‚Äútwitter girl‚Äù body type as well. 

Now that it‚Äôs all out that I‚Äôve lied and tried to hide this. She wants to break up with me. I feel guilty and selfish and idk my next step except post here to get out what‚Äôs on my chest. I know I‚Äôm in the wrong here.",0,22,tifu
t3_kolb0a,"TIFU by drinking for the first time, taking wife‚Äôs computer and deleting all photos of her ex","TIFU by drinking for the first time, taking wife‚Äôs computer and deleting all pictures of her ex.

BACKSTORY In 2015 my now wife then girlfriend cheated on me, with a kiss to (let‚Äôs call him Dean).  Now I know in the spectrum of cheating it‚Äôs not that bad, or at least shouldn‚Äôt be that bad.  And I didn‚Äôt blame her a lot since I loved her and we were at the end of a 4-year long distance in a 8 year relationship.  Long story short, she moved back in with me, but wanted to leave me emotionally for about 8 months(all the while I was like wtf).  Then I won her back, proposed, and eventually married her.  We had a great wedding (Dean wasn‚Äôt invited) and 2 years of marriage.  Sometime along the way she asked for kids but we were too busy.  COVID hit and my work situation changed to where we had to do long distance again.  We have been doing long distance for 2 months.  Her schedule is really busy, so I surprised her this year by flying to her on New Year‚Äôs Eve..

12/31 11 PM I was greeted by a warm.., ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like surprises.‚Äù  She invited me in anyway.  At some point in the night she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to start drinking.‚Äù  I‚Äôve never drank before but I grabbed the 5.5% alc bottle and poured myself a glass.  Then I asked for her computer to turn on the New Year‚Äôs Eve ball drop countdown...

After browsing online for a bit, a message popped up(macbook) on the screen and I saw a conversation of her talking to a friend saying her heart liked Dean but her brain liked me.  I was surprised, and admittedly a bit jealous.  I don‚Äôt remember what happened but I know we argued a bit, and she went to bed early.  I ended up finishing the glass and some time during the night managed to delete every one of Dean‚Äôs photos from her MacBook.  It‚Äôs an action I regret but I was tired of Dean autopopulating her photomemories book.  I must have deleted hundreds of photos... didn‚Äôt realize they took so many together.  But it wasn‚Äôt until now I realized why the kiss was so monumental to her.

NEW YEARS DAY.  She wakes up, finds out what I did, and goes ballistic.  I wake up to her screaming and am so confused as to what happened at all last night.  She shows me and I finally start to remember.  She asks me to restore them... I can‚Äôt (I must have permadeleted them).  She then asks for a divorce.  Yikes.  Happy New Year...

TL;DR I suprised my wife for New Year‚Äôs Eve, drank for the first time, found wife‚Äôs chat to friend about her liking her ex, and drunk deleted ex‚Äôs photos on her computer.  New Year comes and then asks for a divorce amid me trying to recall what happened the night before.",11,41,tifu
t3_kokrqr,TIFU by being drunk,"Obviously it‚Äôs New Year‚Äôs, and I definitely drank all night, and was not even hungover... I was still a bit drunk still when I got up. Meanwhile I had to work today. I woke up early, took a shower, and then my bright mind thought bringing some booze to sip on throughout the day would help prevent/reduce a hangover. However, my bright mind didn‚Äôt think about my behavior while drunk...

Now I wasn‚Äôt like shloshing about like some asshole and being a drunk idiot. I was just less introverted than normal and had a slight slur to my voice.

Apparently that was enough to tip off my boss. He confronts me and I find out that he is a recovering alcoholic. He has seen every coverup for booze. He saw through my ‚Äúseltzer‚Äù in about an hour and confronted me about it. He and I had a heart to heart about addiction and drinking, and we promised it would be a one time lapse of judgement and it would not be spoken about again.... he had me put the ‚Äúwater bottle‚Äù I had filled with vodka in my car and let me continue my shift.

As much as I trust him, I can‚Äôt help but feel anxious and am afraid he will take it further. It‚Äôs been a few hours and he hasn‚Äôt brought it up. He said he values me and doesn‚Äôt plan to take it up with HR.

I guess I will find out in the days onward.

I got caught at work with booze and I‚Äôm scared my boss will go further with it, even though he said he won‚Äôt",11,7,tifu
t3_kokjim,TIFU by suppressing my emotions when I was a kid.,"I'm very bad at writing stuff like this, so this might feel all over the place but read till the end.

I don't certainly know if this qualifies as a TIFU post but I have to get it off my chest, and my fuckup might help others.

I was born prematurely and was always sensitive about emotions back in the day. In this society being overly sensitive is a curse. I was quite an intelligent child in 1-5th grade and I never had to learn actually spend time learning. Because of this, I became a lazy kid and also due to my gaming addiction. This became my downfall. I started getting worse grades after 5th grade and I took these, way too seriously emotionally. I felt dumb but couldn't help it because I didn't want to spend time studying, but I suppressed these emotions so much that I was always happy on the surface but deep down I was a trainwreck. Whenever I performed badly in sports I always thought everything was my fault and I took it to my heart. But due to my emotion suppressing nobody knew (up to this day). I didn't like math because I've never had experienced success because I didn't want to study. 

I've become an introvert because of this. As I was an only child my mother really loved (loves) me and she always bought clothes for me even when I was 14+, and my friends and classmates used to ""bully"" me for it. I never told anybody so this went on and on. The thing is now I've almost completely lost my ability to feel love. I don't even know what love is anymore. I don't even feel love for my parents or relatives anymore or at least I don't know if I feel it. After graduating from the gymnasium, I had enough points to get into a university where I learn to be a software engineer so at least I achieved something. Anyway, I've never had a girlfriend and I now don't want one because I don't think I need anyone to love me, and knowing this consciously is fucking depressing.

My friends and even my parents also asked if I was gay, and I didn't tell them ""no I'm just fucking empty inside and I don't truly love anyone"" and the worst thing is that I'm not actually depressed. I'm truly empty,  I don't even know what I'm feeling as of writing this. So moral of the story if you are a gaming addict and a huge introvert then please shit on everyone's bad opinions whos doesn't matter. Set some personal goals for yourself and start working towards them. 

TL;DR I suppressed my sad emotions so much when I was a kid that now I don't know what love is anymore despite being loved by others.",31,7,tifu

The big problem here is that it is a really weird fetish account. If it was just a regular nsfw account i wouldn‚Äôt have a really big problem with it but this fetish is a really big secret of mine.

t3_kok0sr,"TIFU (almost, fingers crossed) by working overtime on new year's day","This is the situation that led directly to me having to take this overtime shift - 

https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/kollv1/aita_for_telling_my_drunken_heartbroken_30f 

So here's the background - I currently work as many as 72 hours weekly, in 12 hour shifts. I'm in a warehouse job (Macy's in Martinsburg WV, now that I'm back in the states from living in NZ temporarily) while I wait for a few office job opportunities to trickle in. I commute two hours to work right now for pay that is worth the trip. 

Today, I signed up for overtime. Note - I do not drink or do drugs, I'm completely sober. I take my prescriptions as prescribed and that's it, and I vape sometimes.

I live with an 80 year old Vietnam vet, a 30F, and a 50M (we rent a house). They're all aware of my work schedules but I don't hold it against them if I get kept up. Last night the 30F came home about an hour after I fell asleep (9PM) and started being loud with 50M and festive. I asked them if they could take it outside or be a little quieter but it's NYD so I wasn't super worried. What happened next kept me awake all night lol.

Our neighbors started shooting fireworks off and our cops don't care about noise ordinances. I had no choice when picking this shift up, it was a swap that I had to sign up for to not lose my job. 

TL;DR So I got two hours of sleep last night, and I'm currently on my 5th red bull as of 1pm. I fell asleep on the drive home and nearly crashed, so here I am on the shoulder of I-70 about to take a nap. One more hour and twenty minutes to drive left.

I had been eagerly awaiting these shoes, so of course I wanted to go on a run that day! Mind you, I live in the rainy PNW, and instead of a white Christmas we were having a rather wet Christmas (as in rainy, get your head out of the gutter). As a true Washitonian I proclaimed to myself that a little rain wouldn't get in the way of a nice run. But alas, I was wrong. I ran about 5 mins before I slipped down one of those slick divets in the sidewalk and sprained my ankle. On Christmas. I had to call my bf to drive literally 30 seconds to pick me up.  When I got back my family was blaming the shoes and asked if we should take them back. But no, it really wasn't the shoes, I am just a dumbass. So stupid, fuck 2020! So glad it's over now!

t3_koj1xh,TIFU by not knowing that testicular torsion was not part of puberty,"Since everyone else is sharing their testicular torsion story, I would like to share mine as well. I had no idea how common this was.

The event happened back in 2012 when I was 16 years old, but the story starts years before that. Occasionally, in the middle of the night while sleeping, I would suddenly wake up from this excruciating pain (similar to how it feels when you get your balls kicked). The pain usually lasted for a minute or two, and I would just fall back asleep. This usually happened several nights per year, nothing major. I just thought to myself, ‚Äúhey this is just part of puberty‚Äù as I was still in my early teens.

Fast forward to 2012, I noticed that these nights kept happening more and more often. I was starting to get worried, so I turned to Dr. Google, who usually had an answer for everything health-related. I forgot exactly what keywords I used to search it up, but it was something along the lines of ‚Äúballs hurt at night‚Äù and ‚Äúballs hurt in the middle of my sleep‚Äù. I guess these keywords of complaints weren‚Äôt enough for Dr. Google to know what the hell was going on, so I didn‚Äôt get an answer.

One day, while I was showering (getting ready to go to a birthday party), that pain suddenly came up. Only this time, it was much worse, and I was able to actually see what my balls looked like while this was happening. Imagine a pale, enlarged grape with veins running under its thin layer of skin. I yelled out for help, and my dad came rushing in (at this point, I didn‚Äôt care that I was naked).  He told me to dip my balls in warm water, so I did. The level of pain fluctuated, but the warm water wasn‚Äôt enough to make it go away. At this point, my mind was still set on going to that birthday party.

About 20 minutes later (now in my room, waiting for it to go away), the level of pain kicked it up a notch to the point where I was in agony, grabbing my bedsheets and ripping it to shreds. At this point, my dad decided that it was time to call 911. The ambulance came and picked me up. Funny thing was, I don‚Äôt remember them turning on their sirens on the way to the hospital. 

Doctor assessed my scrotum, and said it was testicular torsion. I had to go in for an emergency surgery. Next thing I knew, I was in a hospital bed and my family members all surrounding me. I went home the same day with stitches running across my left nut. Later that night, I called my friend saying sorry I missed his birthday. Didn‚Äôt give him the exact reason why. All I told him was that I had a health emergency.

t3_koiqaz,TIFU by accidentally drinking my girlfriend‚Äôs blood.,"So this happened more than a year ago, but it nearly happened again last night and that reminded me of the incident. 

You see, my girlfriend has a problem with chronic nosebleeds. She gets them at least every other day. As some may know, nosebleeds can be triggered by rapid blood pressure changes.

So one evening we were getting frisky. We hadn‚Äôt seen each other for about three weeks so  we were not as attentive to outside things as we normally were. It seems that her blood pressure shot up and the bleeding started. 

If you‚Äôve ever had a strong nosebleed you may know that blood can easily go to the mouth rather than just the nose and throat. Well that happened.  Normally she can feel a nosebleed coming on. That night she didn‚Äôt. I tasted something strange but ignored it because I had better things to do. 

After a bit we broke apart to breathe and realized that we were both blood smeared. I put two and two together and realized that the taste was blood and that I had indeed swallowed some.

This was early in our relationship but luckily we both thought it was funny and we didn‚Äôt get awkward over it. The nosebleed didn‚Äôt stop for a couple hours though so our activities were effectively halted. That lead to a lovely long, deep conversation, so all in all it wasn‚Äôt too much of a fuck up.

t3_kohmri,TIFU by starving myself for months,"For the past couple months, I've (21F) been using Weight Watchers to lose some weight and eat healthier. For those of you who don't know, weight watchers uses a points system instead of counting calories. I get 30 points a day to spend on food, and 30 weekly ""extra"" points if I want to eat more than the allotted 30 points in a day. The points are very abstract and take into account calories, carbs, fats, protein and probably more. Things like fruits and veggies are no points (except avocados) and high carb, low protein foods, like bread, are tons of points. In order to shame you for using too many extra points weight watchers color codes your days: blue days are days you stayed within 5 points of your goal, white days are days you went too many over.

My boyfriend has always been skeptical of weight watchers. He doesn't like how abstract the points are and the lack of transparency about what a point actually means, or how it doesn't tell you how fast you're losing weight or what it's goal weight for you is. Today he decided to look back though and calculate how many calories are in the average point, just out of curiosity (this is a man who makes spreadsheets for fun). Turns out weight watchers has been making me eat under 1000 calories a day, with the majority of my days being around 700 to stay in the healthy blue day range.

Weight Watchers has literally been starving me! I'm 5'4 151 pounds, according to calorie calculators I should be eating 1300 a day to lose a pound a week, not averaging 700! My boyfriend has been getting exasperated with me for always talking about being so hungry, and it turns out thats because I've been eating just over half as much food as I thought I was and should be! He now understands my plight. I've switched over to a calorie counting app, leaving weight watchers behind.

TL;DR: Weight Watchers has been shaming me every day I eat more than 700 calories for the past several months, so I've been starving myself for its approval, not knowing how little it was making me eat.",1555,305,tifu

I‚Äôm kind of a last-minute, by-the-seat-of-my-pants kind of girl. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt care, I just have ADHD and forget about my responsibilities a lot. So, while I had bought Christmas gifts for my family, I hadn‚Äôt wrapped them yet by the night of Christmas Eve. I was planning to do it once the rest of my family had gone to bed.

t3_kogio9,TIFU by letting redditors play audio through loudspeakers in my home,"Ok so I don't know if this will get lost in new, but if it doesn't then you‚Äôre in for a doozy of a story.

So a few weeks ago I had the brilliant idea to try and make something similar to the tts donation bot streamers use. 

I had remembered that Michael reeves once made something similar, so I decided to just rip his old code. The problem was, he had made his code nonfunctional meaning that when you sent him a message it didn't go anywhere. Anyway, after a few hours of tinkering and coding, I've rebuilt the site to actually function and to allow text to speech so i added it to my discord server, to outstanding success. People loved going to the site, typing something and then having me hear it out of the loudspeaker i‚Äôd setup. So i decided to put it on reddit...

This is where the real FU happens for obvious reasons. So it's been about 10 hours now and I had horrible sleep not only because Redditors were flickering my lights but also because I received 50k messages overnight. 

Fifty. Thousand. Text to speech. Messages. In 8 hours. 

So yeah IDK if this is eloquent I'm typing it on so little sleep but TLDR I gave Redditors the ability to annoy me and they abused it.

I‚Äôll probably not link the site here because I don't want to be accused of advertising but you can ask for the link if you want and I'll reply with it.

Edit: someone asked for it so... I made a sub. Sorry if this feels like advertising, i swear its not. anyways the sub is r/theannoyingmachine",235,50,tifu
t3_kogamd,"TIFU by drinking tea, again","Edit: So this happened this morning. 

Hey y‚Äôall, it‚Äôs me, again. 

So after staying up till about 3am watching all the Star Wars movies in a marathon to usher in 2021, I woke up at like, 11:30. That‚Äôs cool, it‚Äôs technically still the morning I guess. I drag my groggy 5 months pregnant mess of a self into the kitchen to make my morning cup of tea. That‚Äôs easy; put the kettle on, boil water, choose a flavor, and steep to the desired strength. Simple. 

For those of you who read my previous TIFU involving a tea that my mother in law gifted me that contained an allergen, you‚Äôll know I enjoy gourmet teas. I like robust flavors, though I lean towards the fruity undertones. So I chose a delicious lemon lime brew, read the ingredients to make damn sure there were no allergens in it (I learned from my past mistakes), added some honey, and let it steep. 

Now, I want you to understand one important detail: I have never had a gag reflex. I can grab my uvula and tug it, stick my fingers down my throat, you name it. Let your imagination go wild. I have never had a gag reflex so, in the way that humans are born without paws and literally cannot relate to having toe beans, I cannot relate to having a reflex that prevents anything from getting too far down my throat.

Now, for the FU. Part of the fun of drinking tea is savoring the delicate aroma of the brew. Gotta just get that smell all the way into your lungs. So here I am, lifting my tea to my mouth to take a sip, and I am just LOVING that zesty lemon lime scent. Mm. Fucking A, I can‚Äôt wait to get this tea flavor all up in my grill. The tea cup hits my lips, the aroma hits my olfactory receptors, and I am just loving this experience so much that I want MORE. I want so much more that I (stupidly) take a GIANT BREATH at the same moment that the delicious tea is making its way across my taste buds, effectively pouring the whole cup of tea straight down my trachea. 

Turns out, my lungs didn‚Äôt enjoy the actual tea even half as much as they enjoyed the aroma of the tea, and I just cough/sprayed this whole ass gulp of tea all over my kitchen. My lungs had no chill. My husband was alarmed at first but then he realized what happened, and two hours later and he is still making fun of me. 

TLDR: if you like the way your tea smells, it will taste better if you don‚Äôt just pour it straight down your windpipe.",16,8,tifu
t3_kog22f,TIFU by telling my boyfriend about a dream where I killed him,"I know this post makes me sound like a psychopath and I probably am. I have some ASPD symptoms and did some truly fucked up things as a child, but I think I have at least some empathy now and enough self-control that I have not done anything like that in years, though I still have violent urges and fantasies.

Yesterday morning I woke up next to my boyfriend (who moved in with me very recently), turned to him and told him in graphic detail about a dream I had where I violently strangled him to death. My brain hadn't started working properly and I didn't even realize what I had said until I saw the horrified expression on his face. I apologized and he said it was ok but he looked scared and very unconformable. I apologized more and tried to explain that I often have violent dreams but that I would never do anything like that or hurt him in any way. It didn't work and he understandably wanted to get away from the person who had just described herself murdering him, so he said he would go for a walk and quickly left. He returned hours later but was still different and seemed unconformable with me for the rest of the day.

I laid awake on the couch all night because he didn't seem to be able to fall asleep with me in bed with him. He is still asleep and I'm still trying to figure out what I should do or say when he wakes up. I wish I could undo what I said and I hate myself for being this way. Maybe I should wish I had told him everything about myself before we moved in together instead. He would probably have left me but he will probably anyway and wouldn't have to be afraid in his own home. I don't know. I don't even know how he is feeling because even though I understand that it's scary to normal people, it wouldn't be scary for me if the roles were reversed so it's difficult to empathize. I know he definitely deserves better than me.

I don't know why I'm posting this rambling. It's not funny or interesting. It's just sad. I think I'm going to try to fall asleep before he wakes up so I can put this off a few more hours and maybe be less sleep deprived.

TL;DR: I told my boyfriend about a dream where I strangled him to death and now he is afraid of me and know what a fucked up person I am.

Update: We talked about it again today and it went much better this time. I asked him to describe how he felt when I talked about the dream and how he feels about me now. I listened and did my best to empathize. He said that he feels like I really listened to him and understands him and that this was the first time he could tell someone about how their actions made him feel bad without getting a defensive response. He hugged me and said that he feels much safer now. I feel incredibly relieved and think we actually grew closer because of this. I will try to open up more to him as well, but I need to do it slowly and in the right way so I don't scare him again.",22,8,tifu
t3_kofjqt,TIFU by letting my friend find my Furry Reddit account.,"Well, it happened a little while ago, my best friend who knows that I am a furry got acess to my furry reddit. I don't know how he made it but he actually found me. 

But the thing is  that I am a furry artist, I work on SFW pieces and also NSFW pieces. Turns out that day I was uploading a very subjective drawing of my sona (that he knows). 

He announced on Messenger that he found my reddit, my heart raced when I saw the text. So I immediately DMed him and told him to stop. I told him that this was private and that was really rude of him.

The worst part is that it was actually gay yiff (furry porn). He did not know at all that I was gay (I found that out really recently). So I had to come out to him, (wich is extremely annoying) and made him swear that he'll never tell the others.

I felt extremely ashamed and exposed, and the fact that he was buisy and not responding was extremely upsetting. Fortunately he apologized, and we became buds like before.

But that was an extremely painful experience.






Disclaimer : I mostly take part in SFW furry activities, the adult part is a part of the fandom that we cannot ignore but it's not its core. 

I wanted to share this with you, cause it taught me a lot about privacy. And might make some of you think about what they post. (You're responsible of what you post) 

And NO! you won't find that drawing I deleted it. My reddit account is now strictly SFW

t3_kofal8,TIFU by announcing in front of everyone that my brother's boyfriend has a small dick,"This happened right after the clock striked midnight. 

It was me, my brother, his boyfriend, our neighbor, and their shared friend. They are all the same age and I'm 3 1/2 years older, so we were just kind of hanging out and listening to music. Taking a few shots. 

For back story, my brother started dating a new guy about 4 months ago. Apparently his new partner had some problems with sex in the past but they were ready to try ~2.5 months ago. This is where it gets weird. On a separate drunk occasion, just me and my brother, around the same time they started talking about having sex, he blurted out that his dick was too big for his new boyfriend to feel comfortable with. He also told me his boyfriend's dick was way smaller and this made it a little awkward at first. Understandable, I guess. 

Fast forward the next few months that lead us up to New Year's Day. My brother will not stop talking about how his dick is too big for his boyfriend and his boyfriend's dick is tiny and apparently this is a bigger problem than I thought in their relationship. I'm getting so sick of hearing about it, I just want to roll my eyes and walk away if one of our friends bring it up with him and I'm in the room. However, being a good sibling and friend I don't want to seem rude and I just go on my phone or something. 

Last night I was drinking a lot, but alcohol (especially vodka) takes a long time to catch up with me. I guess it all caught up with me around midnight, a classic mistake. My brother's boyfriend excused himself to the bathroom and my brother immediately started talking to his friend saying ""I think we're going to try tonight, but my dick his dick yada yada yada"" 

I guess I was just drunk enough to remember important things because I just said, loudly, ""WE ALL KNOW YOUR BOYFRIEND HAS A SMALL DICK"" right as he was coming back out of the bathroom. He stopped, I stopped, everyone stopped. We stared. His boyfriend stormed off. My brother gave me this look that I can only assume means death is coming. I really wasn't expecting him to be done in the bathroom so quickly I guess. I think I was trying to be funny but also all of my fed up annoyance was forcing its way out. 

I apologized profusely and went up to my room, showered, thought about my mistake and went to bed. It's the next morning and nobody is awake yet and I'm just hoping everyone was too drunk to remember that happening this morning. I feel awful, especially since the drunk numbness is worn off. 

TL;DR: Just read the title. I think my brother is going to kill me but I will keep everyone updated.",129,37,tifu
t3_koeqcn,TIFU by excitedly telling my parents about my guns.,"Actually happened about 4 or five days ago. So i‚Äôm 26 now, but growing up my parents were vehemently anti gun. But as the years have gone by, they‚Äôve become more and more okay with the prospect of gun ownership. My dad has even been toying with the idea of getting his concealed permit and buying one for himself. A couple years ago, my parents offered to let me and my wife stay at their house after the lease on our apartment was done, while we save up everything we can to get a house. We almost did but then the deal fell through, and covid happened shortly after so that has been put on hold. Well at this time i had already had a hand gun for quite a while, and my mom still has a very strict ‚Äúno guns under my roof‚Äù policy. It was my understanding that we have a sort of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ask don‚Äôt tell‚Äù thing going on because my mother and i make cryptic comments acknowledging that I keep guns in the house. The most recent example:
Me:‚Äùhell yeah! Guns are bad! I would never own a gun. This house is a gun free zone! /s‚Äù

Mom: ‚Äúyou must think i‚Äôm an idiot or something because i‚Äôve been letting you get away with shit for years. You only get away with the shit that i allow you to get away with‚Äù

Well i was excited because I recently got approved for my concealed permit, and i was joking with my dad that we should use his 3d printer to make a gun.

‚ÄúWhy wouldn‚Äôt you just buy one? Seems a lot easier‚Äù he said

‚ÄúWhy would i need to buy one? Didn‚Äôt mom tell you I already have two in the house?‚Äù

My dad‚Äôs first reaction is he‚Äôs pissed off not because of the guns, but because my mom would hide something like that from him (literally the only two things my dad has ever cared about my entire life 1. Work hard 2. Don‚Äôt lie to people)

So he calls her, and as it turns out, my mom actually wasn‚Äôt aware of the heat that‚Äôs being packed in her house. I showed my dad the guns, and while he‚Äôs a little uncomfortable,i showed him how they work, how to make them safe, how to mitigate the risks of accidentally shooting yourself or someone you love.

My mom on the other hand, didn‚Äôt talk to me for the first two days, now she‚Äôs starting to talk to me again, but i can still tell she‚Äôs pissed off and hurt because I disrespected her wishes (one of the very few things she asks of me) and i feel like a huge piece of shit because my mom is a literal saint and she deserves better. Life kinda sucks right now but hopefully one day we‚Äôll be able to laugh about this.... i somehow doubt it tho.


TL;DR: i snuck guns into my anti gun parent‚Äôs house, then proudly proclaimed that i did that only to find out that they are still anti gun.",2,13,tifu
t3_koe1m3,TIFU by getting drunk and playing hide and seek,"So it was new years eve yesterday and I (F 21) kept up with the theme of 2020 by ending it on a shit day. I started by slipping on an icey patch outside my house and landing flat on my back in view of my neighbours. My bum took the brunt of the fall and I spent the rest of the day walking round like I had shit myself. In the evening I went over to a friend's house for some drinks and we ended up playing drinking games till we were too fucked to string a sentence together. We then unanimously decided (there were four of us) drunk hide and seek was a great idea. So my friend starts counting and my drunk self that now has the motor skills and excitement of a 6 year old runs upstairs to find a hiding place. This is where the fuck up begins. One of my friends persuades me that we should climb up into the attic to hide and I agree because that's an amazing hiding place. We climb up and crouch behind some boxes and start giggling like children as we here muffled confused noises from below as they search for us. After 5 mins of not being found I decide to give in and show everyone where we were hiding. I get up and drunkily stammer towards the exit forgetting that it's important to only walk on certain parts of the attic. My drunk reaction time was too slow and before I knew it my leg was making an uninvited appearance in my friends bedroom. So I ruined the night by putting a leg shaped hole in her ceiling and I now owe her money to get it fixed. 

To top it all off I woke up this morning feeling extremely guilty and hungover. The urge to throw up suddenly overwhelmed me and I ran to the bathroom. My boyfriend kindly followed with some water to support me and was greeted by the sound of my wretching so hard I involuntary squeezed a fart out of my bruised bum. Great start to 2021.

t3_kochqv,TIFU by getting my helix pierced,"So this is currently and on going situation. 

TL;DR at the bottom
 

Two weeks ago I decided to get my right helix pierced. So I went to the shopping centre found a piercing shop that had a pretty good reputation and did just that. I was given the soothing spray to help prevent infection, and it hurt for a bit but then all was well. 

Until 3 days ago.

My ear was beginning to throb on and off, was getting visibly redder and more swollen and it was pussy. Just this afternoon, I noticed that the pain from my ear was travelling down my neck. And at the end of that line of pain was a small lump which isn't on the other side of my neck. This was a bit concerning so I went a told my mum and she took one look at my ear and decided I needed to get on antibiotics straight away because my ear is very infected. But we couldn't find any doctors clinics that were open since it was late in the afternoon (about 5:30).

When we got home at about 6pm this afternoon and dad took a look and said I should go to the hospital. By now the pain had travelled into my head above my  ear, behind my ear, and in my jaw so I couldn't open my mouth very much cause of the pain.

We waited in the emergency room and after about half an hour we got called in. The doctor had a look at my ear and I explained whats happening and he told me that since the infection is pretty bad, the lump in my neck is my lymph node and since the pain is spreading the earring needs to come out, or I am running the risk of getting an even worse infection and the top half of that ear cut off. 

I chose to keep the piercing and take antibiotics which would make the risk of losing half my ear even higher but after a few minutes I changed my mind and got the earring removed. I have just started the antibiotics this afternoon, but apparently there is still a chance they may not work, I might lose some of my ear anyway. 

Definitely the worse $40 I've ever spent.

TL;DR i got my helix pierced, it is now very very infected and I could end up losing the top half of my ear.",15,9,tifu

She tossed the flash drive at me like it was burning her hand and shouted ""GAY PORN!!!"". I raised both hands like I was under arrest or some shit and shouted back ""I don't watch gay porn, and even if I did, I wouldn't save it on dad's flash drive!"". My mom shook her head and sarcastically asked if I, an only child, had any gay brothers she didn't know about. I shrugged and said ""why don't you ask dad who the porn belongs to?"". We went back and forth for another 5 minutes or so before she gave me the good old ""this ain't over"" look and walked away. 

My dad is at work right now and has no idea my mom is waiting for him to come home so he can confirm what she believes - that I'm a liar who loves watching guys fuck and who's more than willing to frame his own father.

t3_koc8ew,TIFU by drinking too much water in my newfound sobriety,"This actually happened last week, but the shame has finally subsided and I feel like I can tell this story. I recently became sober which has been rough, but I've been trying to use it as an opportunity to drink more water. I am also a chronic kidney stone producer and had like 6 stones in September, so I've taken that as a sign to drink as much water as possible. In other words, trying to replace the alcohol I used to drink with water. Seems noble, right?

...not necessarily. Last week I made it my job to drink more water. The doctors recommended I get 2-3L per day, but a few weeks ago I peed out two kidney stones and freaked out because I found out later I still have two more in me. So, I drank 7L of water in one day, with the last 4L being in the span of a few hours. I must've peed like 20 times in a period of 8 hours and was feeling very fatigued.

After watching TV with my husband, I tried to stand up and found that it was incredibly hard to do so. I was experiencing vertigo, a migraine, and intense disorientation. It was then that my husband suggested that maybe I drank too much water, after which I became familiar with the world of water poisoning.

Don't drink too much water, y'all!! We went to the emergency room and I ended up being fine, but it took a few hours for the water to pass through my system. Thankfully it wasn't poisoning, but I definitely drank too much water and enough to cause some pretty severe reactions.

Thankfully I didn't drink too much because it can be fatal! But please take my TIFU as a warning that you should make sure you're being hydrated, but not too much!

But now it's just been a silly response to say when friends ask me how my sobriety is going. But I'm grateful that it wasn't fatal!

t3_koc3ax,TIFU by getting my balls twisted,"Obligatory this happened last night and reporting from my hospital bed this morning. My girlfriend and I were in a Chipotle parking lot when I see a father in the next car over (parked pretty close) letting me get out of the car first.

One hour later, the pain is still there and I‚Äôm about to vomit. Worse pain of my life.

I used to love the inner part of bread when I was small. In fact, I usually removed the crust and just squish the bread and make a ball out of it. I basically removed all the air and fluff of bread and I used to love to eat that. I was around 5 or something and it was summer, I was just sitting on balcony and enjoying my bread ball. I stuffed it all in my mouth and wanted to swallow it. Well, as you can imagine, I choked on it. I choked so bad that I couldn‚Äôt breath anymore and my mum saw and started panicking.

t3_koa23b,TIFU by forgetting Fahrenheit exists,"This happened last night and I still can‚Äôt get over how stupid this was.

My family decided to buy these beautiful (very expensive) tomahawk steaks for NYE. We had just gotten it a new barbecue but didn‚Äôt have the right opportunity since it was mid December. We decided it would be a waste of these beautiful steaks to prepare them in the oven so decided to brave the -3 degree Celsius cold, and prepare them on the grill. We wanted to ensure that they were properly cooked so we watched many tutorials and read all the recipes and decided we were ready. We put them on the grill and after some time and we measured the internal temperature. Now, I thought we‚Äôd go for a rare temperature, and by the time they rested, the temp would go up a bit and we‚Äôd have some medium-rare steaks, right? I looked up a temperature chart, and decided we wanted to be somewhere around 120-125 before resting. We must have grilled those steaks for 50 minutes when we had only reached 75 degrees and decided to put them in the oven because at this point it was 11 PM on NYE and we hadn‚Äôt eaten yet. I take them out of the oven and leave them to rest and at 11:30 on NYE I cut into the steaks and they are downright almost crumbling from how charred and overdone they were. I can‚Äôt even describe how overdone the meat was since I‚Äôve never seen anything like it. Even with a newly sharpened knife, they were hard to cut. I was devastated. I followed all the instructions, how did this happen? Friendly reminder, that I‚Äôm in Europe and my meat thermometer works with Celsius. Cue my idiot realisation: the chart I looked up was in Fahrenheit not Celsius. I think my steaks almost measured 90 C (almost 200 F) internal temperature, let alone the outside bits. The steaks were literally inedible so I cut them up into tiny chunks and used them as a crunchy topping over the mash and we ate mash and salad for NYE.

t3_ko9vff,TIFU by telling my gf that her other outfit was better,"First, happy new year everyone. TLDR at the end


So with my gf we decided to have our first NYE together, like romantic night. All was good, we bought some good food and decided to dress up a bit. 


When I arrived to her place, she was wearing a cute yellow shiny dress which I complimented but in my head thought the dress wasn't her style for some reason. I don't like shiny i guess, nothing important. 


Anyway during the evening, she asked if her yellow dress was cute bc she had another one and i casually told her ""I like it but I think black looks really good on you"" or something like that. 


What a rookie mistake. 


She laughed and that was it or so I thought, and evening went on. At some point, we watched some pictures from Christmas eve, and i said ""you were so cute"", she immediately noted it ""were?"" 
In my head it didn't mean much but I guess that came out wrong and that prob amplified the whole thing. 


Later she decided to change her dress for a black one so I said something about her being so cute, etc. I wasnt suspecting the drama coming yet bc we were still having fun, but I felt something was off.


Anyway, I went to prepare our dinner as she felt a bit asleep during it. When dinner was ready, we started eating but she kept looking at her phone, not saying anything so after some time, I asked what was wrong.


I saw tears coming out of her eyes but she remained silent, didn't want to tell me. She finished eating and left to come back in sweat pants visibly very upset.


I tried to understand what was happening but she wouldn't say. With time, I remembered my comment about the dress so I apologized multiple times but she kept crying, saying that it wasn't about the dress, but the comment made her feel like I wasn't attracted to her in general (which is def not true).


I tried to defend myself, saying I was attracted to her all the time, that this came out wrong. And again I never said anything about her, I just liked one outfit better.


Didn't work, she was still upset, silent..which eventually made me upset too bc all I wanted was a nice evening with the person I love.


She said it was the worst NYE she had, that I disappointed her, and even questioned our relationship saying she didn't want to be with someone who didn't think she was attractive (again not my case). Obviously trying to talk was making things worse so I stopped too. 


We kept watching TV in silence instead of having our romantic night until we went to sleep. 


I'm a bit shocked and surprised. I can understand that she didn't like the comment but to me it was like someone saying ""I like your other sweater better"", I wouldn't care so i can't even relate.


Also, if I'm being honest, I'm convinced the alcohol made the whole thing overdramatic and made her very emotional. I'm not sure if there's an issue here but she's often very emotional when she's drunk, and that has led to this kind of reaction before. Here we drank from 7 to 10:30 so even if it didn't feel like anyone was drunk, it may have played a role. 


I can't sleep now, I probably need to improve my compliments skills but I still don't think it was a good reason to go crazy. Im really affectionate, I give her compliments often and I honestly don't think I make her feel unattractive in any way, because that wouldn't be true.

t3_ko8wha,TIFU by formatting the wrong hard drive.,"This actually happened just about an hour ago. I managed to snag a new Ryzen 7 5800x for MSRP and it arrived today, I installed it, made certain everything was working, and decided ""Hey, I'll start 2021 off right with a freshly reformatted drive!"" Everything went smoothly, til it didn't. Something happened to cause my PC to lock up and crash (Black screen, not blue) soon after I'd boot up. Well, after trying to fix it a few different ways I decided to say ""Screw it, I just reformatted and it was quick enough, let's do it again!""

Well, people of reddit I'm here to remind you to actually make certain you select the right drive/partition you're clicking on rather than just quickly tapping on one and clicking ""delete."" My mouse scroll wheel clicked one too far and before I could stop myself I realized 2.5gb of data, including all the driver and game directories I'd backed up to make the transition easier, as well as all my game save data from my documents folder, are all gone. Pictures, music, my movie library, old documents, deleted.

Well, hopefully that bit of bad luck will make way for some good later on. Remember people, don't try to rush something since it's late at night, know what you're clicking/deleting is actually what you wanna click on/delete!

Well it scared him. Ive had him for a year and now i feel like i reset allll the progress we have made. He keeps looking at me like I have betrayed him and wont let me hold him again. He literally ran out of the room away from me, wouldn't play with the toys i gave him, and has been side eyeing me. Maybe tomorrow he will forgive me.

t3_ko8a3u,TIFU by putting insane amounts of pressure on my leg and almost getting sterilized while celebrating the new year,"Alright, today is the first day of the new year, and I might as well have been the first injury of 2021.  

What happened was, I have this pair of truck horns, which I got when I was a kid.  I don't have an air compressor, so there is a hand pump to blow air through the horns.  The pump needs to be pretty sturdy to expel enough air to get these things going, 50-60 PSI at minimum I'd estimate, as they usually would use like 120 PSI on a compressor.  So, the pump is made of steel, and fairly beefy.  It requires so much force that typically a smaller person won't get the second horn to go (low pitch and higher pitched horns are connected together to make a chord, the higher ones are harder to make sound with), but thankfully I'm able to.  

Anyway, on to what actually happened, since it's new years and this was a pretty crappy year, I'd decided to inform the entire neighborhood (and probably the surrounding city) that the new year was here, and brought up the horns from the basement.  I set them on the back porch, and watched my watch for the timing.  I had the air canister portion of the pump in my hands, and planning to slam the handle end into my leg to sound the horns, in hopes of making them be louder.  At exactly midnight, I slammed the air pump into my leg, the force depressing the handle into the pump, making the horns blow.  Unfortunately, this did not go to plan.  Remember how I said the thing was made of steel?  Well, it slipped right off my sweatpants, right into my genitals.  I didn't notice the pain right away, but it came.  Oh, I forgot to mention, the handle was shaped like an old fashioned ship wheel, so there was more pain than there could have been.  So there I am, laying on the ground in pain, wondering why I didn't just use the ground Instead.  

Turns out, that wasn't all the damage.  I hit my leg so hard there was even some internal bleeding, and two huge welts.  

TL;DR: wanted my truck horns to be louder and doing so caused me to almost be sterilized and caused great bruising to my leg


Happy ending though, I was eventually able to compose myself and used the ground Instead, let me just say it yielded much better results.",10,6,tifu
t3_ko85z3,TIFU by letting my university classmate think I was friend with the guy who made fun of me in junior high,"This actually happened a few years ago but it's one of my cringiest memory to date. First year in university, I was sitting with one of my long term friend and his friend, lets call him B. We were talking about our highschools, me and my long term friend went to the same highschool and B went to this other one. We were dissing each other's highschool and I joked that the stereotype of people from his high school is that they are kinda dumb. B asked me if I know anyone from his highschool, I remembered that most people from my junior high went to that highschool and said one of my classmates name, lets call him E. This was a decision that I would come to regret deeply. 

You see, I had severe social anxiety in junior high. I don't know if anyone here watched the anime watamote but the protagonist is basically an exact copy of myself in junior high except for the really cringy parts. I had almost no friends. E and his friends made fun of me constantly. It was horrible. They even made up a rumor that I had a crush on one of his friend. His friend would make a point on avoiding me and they would always laugh about it in front of me. I really don't know why I mentioned E's name, I probably just wanted to sound like I know a lot of people, but I didn't think it through. I should have just said I didn't know anyone from that highschool. Anyway, B replied ""yeah he's pretty dumb lol"", which means he knows him. At this point I realized that B probably misunderstood the nature of our relationship, but I didn't feel the need to correct him because my experiences in junior high was pretty embarrassing, and I don't really expect to talk to B again since he's just a friend of my friend.

Here comes the embarrassing and weirdly coincidencial part. After our chat I walked to the train station with my long term friend and B. Guess who we see on our way? That's right. Out of 30000 students in our university, we see E. And who is he surrounded by? His junior high friends. Oh yeah I forgot to mention they all went to the same university as me. At this moment, I almost believed in God because it really felt like a higher power was doing this on purpose to fuck with me. B, immediately upon seeing E, started yelling ""hey, there's your friend E, lets go talk to him."" I think I mentally died at this point and just started walking forward with my long term friend without saying anything. They just all looked at me weird. I forgot what I even said afterward. Something along the lines of ""we are not friends! I was socially awkward in junior high!"" I did not mention that they made fun of me in junior high because I felt like that would be a bit too embarrassing. What's worse is E and his friends then continued to walk with us to the train station and wait with us. And somehow E fucking knows my long term friend too. They all start to have a conversation at the train station and I slowly back away because I'm still traumatized by E and his friends. My long term friend notices this, laughs awkwardly and asks me ""why are you backing away lol"". Awkard silence ensues. 

Anytime I think of this incident I kinda wanna retreat into a hole and never come out again. I also felt like that was the day I lost a tremendous amount of respect from my long term friend. 

Tldr: I let my university classmate think I was friend with a guy that made fun of me in middle school to hide my socially awkward past. He also goes to my university. We run into him 30 minutes later in a weirdly coincidental encounter that almost made me believe in a sadistic God, and I was forced to admit my dark past.",7,0,tifu
t3_ko7hrr,TIFU by stepping into 2021 with $5000 gone from by bank account,"I'm really distraught that I lost $5000, but what's more triggering is that it was all my fault.

I was going through my emails very late at night, which was already a red flag because my judgement always goes out the window in the late hours of the night. There, I saw an email with the subject ""Your paypal account has been suspended"", I immediately clicked on the email and proceeded to fill out all the information it needed to unsuspend my paypal account, but I thought I should check the email that sent me the account suspension, and to my dismay it was clearly a phishing scheme, but the damage was done.

Yet, my stupidity got the better of me, as I never have experience anything like this, I just left it as it is, so today I pay the consequences of my actions when I woke up to most of my money gone down the drain. so add insult to injury, these fuckers took their time to order $60 worth of takeout, so here we are, most of my tuition gone, and no spending money to enjoy the new years. Just when I thought 2020 can't get any worse.

Although I've always been taught that money always come and goes, so my attachment to money wasn't that deep, experiencing this really hurts.

My advice to anyone out there scared to lose their money, is to set up added security with their bank account, and never ever, make life changing decisions at 5 in the morning, never a good idea, and always check the sender's email.

Without washing my hands, I took a shit, scrolled through some memes, and proceeded to wipe myself. It was a bad poop too- it came out loose so I had to do extra wipe to be sure.

Anyway, a few seconds later I feel an itching sensation in my butthole. I gaze at my hands in alarm and see I have red powder all up under my nails and on my palms etc...

I took a shower. I cleaned it as best I could and put some cortisone cream on it, but even as I type this, a burning sensation is living in my asshole. It‚Äôs awful.

t3_ko64ta,TIFU by trying to improve the experience of my guests.,"So, this happened just minutes ago and my anxiety is still at a 12 so, yeah. I'm ready for 2020 to be done now please and thanks.    
   
I manage a small business hotel in a tourist town. We are booked. Tonight is going smoothly and all of my expected guests are checked in. As a habit I check google for reviews at least once a day. Just to make sure there isn't anything that I can do better or things that we can improve.     
    
I saw a new review had been posted giving us a 2/5, the only comment being ""What's the difference between a hotel and a motel?""    
I looked at the name of the reviewer and as it would happen, they are currently checked in!    
 
I thought, why not just go ask them what I could do to make their stay more enjoyable or improve our service? So I looked up their room number and took a stroll with my mask in place and a positive outlook.    
    
My anxiety was at a 2.    
    
I knock on the door and am met with a friendly face. I introduce myself and ask if I could speak to him for a moment to which he invites me in. Without thinking I step in and am met with about 6 other faces, all pointed at me curiously.    
    
My anxiety reaches 5.    

I explain that I had noticed a slightly negative review and wanted to know how we could improve their stay? The gal who had posted, Let's call her Mary, shakes her head and said she hadn't posted any review yet. I smile (hidden behind a mask of course) and nod apologetically saying it must have been a mistake on my part and hoped they all had a wonderful new year before leaving.    

My anxiety climbs to a 7, like an angry Scotsman onto a bar table. There's no ignoring it, ya just gotta live with it now.
    
I get back to the desk and alt tab back to the review to close it, and to my horror, the guest I had spoken with, had a very similar name, but was in fact not the person who had posted the review.    
    
It was another guest whom also is here.    
    
I have to do this again...    
    
My anxiety tips up to 8.    
    
I walk to the correct guest's room and knocked on the door as politely as I can while trying to figure out what the hell to do with my hands and simply putting them in my pockets seemed somehow inappropriate.     
A gentlemen's voice answered ""Can I help you?"" I asked him if I could speak with him for only a moment and was in a moment greeted by a shirtless man peering from around the cracked door.    
    
I had interrupted but there was no turning back now.    
     
My sudden panic, embarrassment and instincts to just run hit me like a can of twisted Tea.    
    
It was all I could do to regurgitate the same thing I had told the previous guest. Something something about improving their stay... My mind was a blank.    
    
A female voice from inside the room called out ""We'll get back to you!"" At that point, I thanked them, wished them a happy new year and am now sitting here typing all of this out to you just trying to process what just happened.

So, on New Year‚Äôs Eve, I got dressed all prettily, doing my make up and everything and my husband found me cute since it had been a while since I dressed up nicely. He had made his wishes to be known previously that he wanted to do something fun and eventually he led me away from my computer with said intentions.

Well before this, I warned him that I kind of had to pee but taken in by the mood, he wasn‚Äôt too bothered by the statement and just went with it anyways and we got into it. We both figured I could hold it as well. Eventually, I randomly ended up thinking about how badly I wanted a kitten because I had previously been looking at cute cat pictures and said, ‚Äò‚ÄôI want a kitten‚Äô‚Äô in the middle of it all. Yes, it wasn‚Äôt the best time to bring up the topic. 

Anyways, his confused reaction was so funny that I ended up laughing a ton, both pushing him out and realizing that the lack of previous pressure combined with my laughing let something else loose as well and I barely had the time to say ‚Äò‚ÄôI‚Äôm peeing‚Äô‚Äô as a warning as he hastily backed away wondering if what he thought happened, actually happened.

So yes folks, I just gave my husband a great start to 2021 with an accidental golden shower.

**TL:DR** ‚Äì Had a fun time with my husband during new year‚Äôs eve, had to pee but thought I could hold it, ended up making myself laugh, letting it all loose.

Now the temperature is solid below zero and the humidity makes it feel a lot colder. I get through the town in ten minutes thinking about sleeping under the blankets in a bit. I make it through our gate and I stick my keys into the hole, and... Stuck. My father left the keys in the lock. I can't get in. Now we don't realy have a doorbell and my father and my sister sleeps on the second floor where noones hears anything when I bang on the doors. Nevermind I call them. I call my father. No answer. Sis. No answer. I called them at least 5 times already and no one answers. And they won't wake up only if I scream loud enough to wake the whole neighbourhood, which I won't do. I went back to my buddies place but he doesn't answer the phone nor his doorbell. So I'm currently back at our place and I managed to break into our basement. It's still cold but at least it's not windy and the temperature is better than outside.

t3_ko4e2y,TIFU By Falling for a Utility Scam,"First off I know the rules say no stories about scams but I hope the mods will allow this one because it is more of a life lesson for people.

So two days ago I happen to have heard someone talking to my adjacent neighbor in my apartment building and me being nosey I glanced through the peep hole to see who it was since that neighbor NEVER comes out of his apartment. Never had seen him until then talking to this guy I‚Äôd never seen before. Anyway after my snooping I went about my business until a few minutes later a hear a knock at my own door which is already weird because it was too late for deliveries. I glanced through the peep hole to make sure I wasn‚Äôt gonna get murdered instantly and saw a guy in maybe his late twenties or so who honestly looked like someone from our maintenance crew so I opened up. He started mumbling his bs about how he was with RPA energy suppliers and how he needed to check my energy bill for my rate. My dumbass went along with it and gave him my bill which he then got my account number from and had me sign all this bs and such. 

Now, first and foremost DONT EVER DO THIS. I made a mistake, however I had been receiving official letters and announcements from my energy provider about changes to renewable energy and such so I sorta thought this was what it was about and they just needed everyone‚Äôs opinion. I also figured since he was still on the apartment premises that he was supposed to be there since there is a no solicitation rule. Alda, scammers don‚Äôt care about them. 

Fast forward to today (New Years Eve) and I see an email from our complex saying there is a guy going door to door asking for utility bills. He is not supposed to be here and he has been asked to leave multiple times. Great so now I know I screwed up and of course tomorrow is a holiday and then it is a weekend so I have to wait till Monday to hopefully make things right. The scam business is RPA energy and supposedly I have the option to cancel the service within 7 days which I plan on doing. I also plan on calling my energy provider and tell them to not make any change to my account. 

From what I have gathered, some state have deregulated energy laws (I‚Äôm in OH) and these door to door people are technically not doing anything illegal by getting you to transfer to their energy providers but they then hike up your energy rates after a few months. So that‚Äôs a scam in my book so please don‚Äôt make the same mistake as me and never give account information of any kind to anyone at your door. It may sound like common sense but sometimes the stars align and we al find our inner dumbass ü§™ happy new year everyone!

I once dated a girl who had an older sister that looked extremely similar to her. After seeing her around a lot (we had a lot of mutual friends) and getting to know her, she invited me over to her house to hang out. I showed up while she was in the shower so her sister answered the door. At that point I had only ever talked to my Future-EX at parties and stuff, so I assumed maybe she was just a little different when she was at home.

I'm pretty shy, so since she was looking at me weird and didn't say anything at first, I kind of forgot to say ""Hi \[insert name here\],"" and just started stammering things out. I talked to her, obviously expecting that I was welcome inside (it was freezing outside) and that she was expecting me, but this only made things worse. The sister was confused and really weirded out as there was a strange teenager who she didn't know, was being flirty with her, and repeatedly insisting that she had invited them over standing on her porch. She ended up shutting the door in my face and refusing to open it again, probably intending to call the police if I didn't leave.

It was a freezing December day, and my mom had dropped me off so I had no way to get home. I was walking down the street, knowing I had about an 2 hour walk ahead of me, feeling the most rejected I had ever felt in my life, when my Future-Ex came sprinting at me, hair still dripping from the shower, giving me a huge hug and explained everything. The relief I felt was unimaginable and strangely enough, it might be one of my happiest memories I can think of.

 We started at 7pm, and by 9:30 I had had just about the whole bottle of whiskey, 5 cans of cheap beer, a few shots, and 2 well packed bongs. I was absolutely legless.

I don't remember anything past 9:30pm, however my mates today have told me the story of my wee adventure.

Obligatory this happened yesterday and was initially posted to puppy 101 and someone suggested I post here 

Ever have those moments where you question your life choices that led you to this particular moment in time, the combination of all paths that led you to this specific extremely shitty situation. (Pun intended) 


I had one of those yesterday. I have been working with my dog on training her to hold for longer period of time (4 hours) since she is now 8 months. I have been very careful to constantly watch her after 2 hours to make sure she doesn‚Äôt have accidents. 


Yesterday, I walk her out for 15 mins and let her loose in the house and start the roomba. I was gone for an hour doing my thing because why not. She won‚Äôt have accidents in the house. WRONG.......


I walk into the hall to a barking puppy, and behold the glorious Picasso waiting for me in the hall. Neat straight lines smeared across the entire hall carpet, under the tv stand, under every corner it can go. Puppy love  is now encrusted into every single crevice of the roomba. The stink, ohh my god the stink. I could smell it in my dreams.  It is in this moment I questioned my life choices

I had to rush to Home Depot to rent a steam vacuum to clean the carpet. I spent hours removing poop from the roomba and there is still a lot of poop in small holes that I am yet to clean. God have mercy on me.

These 3 pieces of pizza turned out fine but I was still hungry so I stuck the last piece in, except instead of defrosting it, I accidentally cooked it normally. I didn‚Äôt realize this and then proceeded to cook it for another 4 minutes just like last time. If I have any mathletes out there, that puts it at a grand total if 8 minutes (in an 1100 watt microwave). I opened the radiation box and was immediately punched in the face by an ungodly smell and a what my friend thought was a 15 year old cum brick. I thought it right into the trash but after smelling it for about 5 minutes I couldn‚Äôt take it and just doused it with Lysol. Naive me assuming that would do the trick was completely wrong and decided to just take the nowhere-near-full trash bag straight outside and into the bin. No I just hope to the god I don‚Äôt believe in that the smell with be gone by tomorrow morning.

Tl:Dr- accidentally microwaved a slice of pizza for 8 minutes and made my house smell of depression and death

t3_ko1idh,TIFU by Joking about My Hideous Christmas Gift to the Person Who Bought It,"This FU actually happened Christmas night, but I thought it would be funny to share here. I (44F) opened a gift from my 12 year old daughter for Christmas...it was quite an outfit. It was a pair of snakeskin patterned leggings with a racing stripe and a gold asymmetric fringed poncho. Now, I should say I am not known for being a flamboyant dresser. My friend often comments that my typical wardrobe goes from a range of light grey to black. I have never worn a poncho. Of course though, this is my child and I said I love it and thanked her for the gift. Later that night, my husband and I were in the bedroom and I started asking him about what his reaction was when my daughter picked out that outfit for me. I knew obviously he was the one who must have taken her shopping. I actually put the snakeskin pants and poncho on and laughingly started modeling it, saying like, wouldn't it be hilarious to go out in this, and what comments I would get...that I would definitely have to wear it somewhere since my daughter picked it out, and where would you take me for a date wearing this? Etc. just being goofy about it, and finally my husband was like, ""Okay, you have to stop. I picked it out for you, and I just put her name on the present. I thought it looked good on the mannequin."" I felt SO bad that I had been joking about it when he picked it out! I literally have been wearing the pants around the house here and out for a walk multiple times this week, and keep telling him how well they fit and how comfortable they are (which is true--they feel great!).

TL;DR: I badly goofed on a Christmas present to my husband only to find out he selected it, and now I am embracing my 80s glam rocker side for the holidays!",26,7,tifu
t3_ko1all,TIFU by dressing for a hot day,"My housemates have gone away for New Years, so I have the place to myself. It's crazy hot, and I have all the windows open to the back garden, but I'm still roasting. Well, no point rugging up if I'm home alone, right? So, getting dressed this morning consisted only of putting on a shirt. My reasoning was that if anyone looked in through the windows I'd look fully dressed, and I was pretty confident I wouldn't get any visitors.

It's now early afternoon, so the back garden is in full sun. We have a second garden out the front though, so I head out to sit in the shade.

I'm a little worried because our house is right on the main road through the city, but we have a 2 metre high fence around the garden. Surely, surely, no one will come through the gate.

So, I go outside. Not a second after I have stepped foot outside, the breeze, now going through the front door and out the back windows, slams the front door shut. The door can only be opened again with the key.

I'm standing outside, in nothing but a shirt. While ""butt naked"" isn't strictly correct, my butt was definitely naked.

My mind starts racing. My housemates aren't due back from their holidays for another week. I've never met the landlord. I have my phone on me, so I can call for help, but oh, the shame! Then it dawns on me. The windows out the back. I can break in!

I live in an apartment building. The building stretches the entire length of our block, with each apartment having a small garden out front and a second garden in the back. The only way to get from one garden to the other is to walk around the block.

So I stand by my gate, listening for a break in the traffic. But the traffic is constant. After a few minutes, I resign myself to my fate. Taking a deep breath, I open the gate and walk out. I keep my head down, not making eye contact with anyone, and stare at my bare feet as I hurry to the end of the block. There are a lot of cars, and everyone has a clear view.

After what feels like eternity, I round the corner, and head up the much quieter street that lines the side of my apartment complex. Filled with shame, I breathe a sigh of relief. There is no one around, not a single car driving down the road.

I run as quickly as I can, and round the final corner, to our gardens. There is my neighbour, standing in her garden. We look at each other. We look away. I walk briskly to my garden, trying to keep my shirt from flapping around too much. There are my windows, mercifully open. They're high, at chest height. There's no way to hide anything while climbing up here. So, as quickly as I can, I haul myself up on to the windowsill, and, worm-like, shimmy through to belly flop on to the floor. My neighbour saw everything. I can't ever talk to her again.

t3_ko0snn,TIFU - Today i fucked up by popping out my kneecap 3 1/2 hours before Midnight,"
So this happened today just about 4 Hours ago. My Family and I were just starting to drink after dinner and my brother and i wanted to carry a table outside to sit closer to each other.  We carried it out of the living room into the Hallway and had just put the table down to put on shoes to carry the table outside. I walked by the table and then knocked my knee on the big chest in our hallway. In the first moment I thought I just had hit it hard, then the pain endured and I thought I just had turned it badly and then the pain continued and saw that my knee looked unusual. 

When I put down my foot it I screamed out in pain. My mum first thought I had hit my toe but when she saw my pale face and my knee she came running with a chair and called an ambulance. When the paramedics came they immediately said that the kneecap had indeed popped and first tried to put me on the roll cot immediately but first had to move the chair I was on to get me closer to the roller. They put me onto the roller under great pain, supported my knee and rolled me into the ambulance. A painful 10 minute ride later we arrived at the hospital where i got Dipidolor. After x-raying my knee and a short wait to let the painkiller do it‚Äôs work they put my kneecap back in under again, you guessed it, great pain. 

A few minutes later the painkillers finally kicked in and I was able to move my knee again. The Doctor came back, inspected my knee and mumbled something about MRI and torn ligament and went off. My knee got x-rayed again and I got a support put around my leg and then was allowed to stand up on crutches. The painkiller must be good as I was immediately able to stand up on the damaged leg. After that there was a short talk with the doctor, who told me i had to wear the support for the next two days and use crutches the next two weeks, and I was allowed to go. My dad drove me home and I am free of pain for now. I‚Äôm going to bed soon as I got an appointment for tomorrow morning. 

Happy and Healthy New Year everyone, stay safe.

TL;DR : Popped my kneecap out due to being to hasty, spent the evening in the Hospital and will probably on crutches for the next two weeks.",16,16,tifu

Context: it's new year's eve and me and gf are staying at an Airbnb for the moment. We went to buy some groceries and when we got back surprise surprise there was no light. It's Rio de Janeiro so you can imagine how freaking hot it is. 
Despise all this, gf was looking SO hot in that outfit that I couldn't resist and initiated sexy times. Mistake number one that I don't regret.
After, well, you know, sex, I wanted to make us a drink. We bought ice and I was cutting it. I was so out of it that I went full force on the now melting ice. Mistake number two that I DO regret. Result: I ended up stabbing myself on the belly.
Me and gf are physicians and checked the wound... No stitches needed. But I was sweaty and dirty and there was blood. A lot of it.

What a great way to start 2021.
At least now I can say that I literally gave my blood for my gf.

t3_ko0n5i,TIFU by outing my friend as a cheater to his girlfriend.,"Obligatory this didn‚Äôt happen today disclaimer. 

My (24M) friend (24M) is a long time cheater. He and his current girlfriend (24F) were on and off for a while because he intended to keep sleeping around. After a year and a bit they made it official, but he kept sleeping around on the DL. He doesn‚Äôt actively seek it out, but jumps on many a chance to get it in elsewhere. 

Once official, he hosted a small get together pre-corona at his place and we were getting to some drinking games. At some point, I was on the same team as his gf. Now, this girl is super annoying about him, she‚Äôll constantly talk him up and praise him in public to the point of absurdity. This being annoying is common sentiment among our acquaintances. 

When she started doing her thing and yapping about how cool her bf was while we were playing, she mentioned how he was a ‚Äúsex god‚Äù and in a drunken reflex I responded with, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not what I heard from [girl he cheated with]....‚Äù which was true but profoundly inappropriate at which point the girl starts hopelessly bawling her eyes out, understandably. I got kicked out immediately. 

I called to apologize the following morning and he told me that he managed to convince her that I was lying and just being stupid. We made up but not without him obviously carrying some resentment, but overall still being very decent with me.  

They‚Äôre still together, he‚Äôs still unfaithful on a semi-regular basis, and we‚Äôre still great friends. Still, I haven‚Äôt regained a lot of the trust I enjoyed pre-incident.

t3_ko0ge2,TIFU by forgetting to clear my search history when I was high,"I know it may sound a little crazy, but hear me out.

(throwaway for what I hope are obvious reasons.)

Me and my discord buddies got high one night and looked up ""\[any animal\] dick"" just to see what we could find. I was doing most of the searching, and I forgot to open an incognito tab. We were really interested in the duck's for some reason (here's a fun fact you didn't ask for: they're shaped like corkscrews).

The next day, my cousins came over to my parent's place to hang out, and one of them, we'll call her SA, asked if she could use my laptop. I gave it to her, thinking she just wanted to play some flash games or whatever. Later, I went to the kitchen to get a snack. When I finished eating, I sat on the couch and saw my laptop open with ""duck dick"" in the search bar. I heard SA in my room, but I managed to chase her out. (unnecessary detail: I had some duck decoys sitting on a cooler next to my desk)

That was three or four hours ago. She returned my laptop just an hour ago. The conversation went as follows.

SA: (holding out my laptop) So ‚Ä¶ ducks, amirite?

Me: Sorry?

SA: (shrugs) I just figured you liked ducks.

Me: (panicking a little) I mean, I guess they're kinda cool. But what made you think I liked ducks?

SA: Just a hunch.

And then she walked off. She refuses to talk to me, even when I tried to explain myself. Which is fair, I'd do the same if I were her. I locked myself in my room, had a mini panic attack, and told my friends about the situation, all of them laughing at me. Who could blame them?

Now, SA has started to quack at me for no reason. I would just be watching TV and she'd walk up to me, go ""Quack, quack,"" and then leave.

She's started to tell my other cousins about it and I'm a little bit skeptical what her side of the story would be.

t3_ko0dcu,Tifu by accepting gifts from turning point USA,"(This isn‚Äôt more of a tifu as there was more than one person with me).

So before the pandemic began, the spring semester just started in late January this year at my college. I was with Hillel on my campus for the week of welcome helping them out. We have little collectibles to give away like most orgs do on campus. 

So while we were doing our own thing, some random people came up to us and started talking to us about Israel and how much they loved it. Well, since Hillel is considered a pro Israel organization sometimes for Jewish students, we were flattered. They offered us some israel themed collectibles that they also had and we thanked them and we left.

A little while later, another student came up to us. She pointed out that those gifts we received from random people were from the turning point chapter on our campus. We of course were surprised. We may be pro Israel, but we aren‚Äôt considered conservative. We thanked her for pointing it out and decided to hide the gifts tsupa gave us to prevent something controversial happening. The rest of week of welcome went smoothly after that.

t3_knzsy9,TIFU by telling my girlfriend she would look better if she was thinner,"So this happened about half an hour ago and after some groveling. Me and the gf are on the couch having a drink, watching rubbish on the TV. She made the comment
GF:  ""would you still love me if i looked like that in 20-30years"" in a joking cliche way. 

My genuine response being
Me: ""sure, if you still kept your sense of humour and personality"" lovey dovey crap I know. 

GF: ""Great, i can start to letting myself go now"" 

A little background, she has a sizeable tumour around the uterus area, when I say sizeable think 2nd trimester size. 
Now for the FU, my stupid brain tries to make jokes all the time and about 80% of them are just crap. The next words that came out of my mouth were: 

Me:""you would look better if you didn't have the giant tumour"" 

""you would better..."" did I seriously just say those infamous words, words that ruin relationships. And of course I tried to back pedal  with 

Me:""No, that's not what I meant to say""

 Yup, I am just digging the hole deeper now, please just kill me. So, my girlfriend has now given me her full attention and has graciously given me a slim chance to explain what I meant. I took about a couple of minutes to collect my thoughts whilst my girlfriend staring at me with the ""what's my alibi gonna be when they find his body"" look.

Long story short, I thankfully made a coherent explanation of what I was trying to say and my girlfriend understands that I'm a dumb bitch. I have a bad habit of saying the worst things at the wrong times. I have also taken back the first ""I love you too"" when I mistakenly thought she said it first (she said hello).

t3_knzscj,TIFU by going on a run.,"Some backstory: This December (31st for me), my family and I were exposed to covid by a relative early this month, and none of us have gone out. I felt sick relatively late but it is well past the ten day mark since my first symptom and I've felt fine for 3-4 days. 

Onto the fuck up. I'm a teen (and a dumb one at that) who, today, lost one of my closest friends. In need of a pick up I thought I'd go for a run, as that was one of my passtimes I gave up since covid started. It is under freezing temperatures where I am and hyping myself up and sticking a hand outside, I figured I'd be fine with a light hoodie and sweatpants. 

After not even a minute of running, I felt like my throat was closing up, freezing, and my chest felt cold to the core, though my skin was warm. I figured I'd be fine and keep going for another minute until I felt dizzy and (still running, thinking I'm fine and wanting to push my body) run home for the next minute or so. 

I get home, take my hoodie off and lie down in my bed. I then get nauseous and go to the nearest bathroom because I feel like I'm gonna throw up. My freezing chest and dizziness was still very much going on and now I'm out of breath. After 5 minutes or so, I call my parents, thinking Im gonna pass out. They tell me it was stupid to go on a run after being sick and stuck inside for weeks (which I agree with) and to take a hot shower. 

I'm now sitting down in the bathroom after a shower, too out of breath to leave, telling you all my fuck-up. My chest is still cold and deep breaths are impossible without coughing. Tomorrow I'm gonna go on a VERY slow walk.

t3_kny49o,TIFU by leaving a real Christmas tree in my apartment until May.,"I actually fucked up 8 years ago, but time has worn down my pride enough that I'm willing to finally share this story with the world. 

It was recently suggested to me that I leave my Christmas tree up a little longer in order to further enjoy the cheeriness it brings to the living room. This is an easy thing to suggest when you haven't seen the things I've seen. When you haven't done the things that my boyfriend and I have done. You see, when you have one year when you leave your tree up until May, that experience changes you. It changes Christmas forever.

We have always used real trees as opposed to artificial ones, which means they need to be disposed of after the holidays. Back when we lived in an apartment they had a small window of time when you could leave the tree by the curb and they would haul it away for you. Unfortunately we missed that window, which turned into weeks and weeks of pretending the tree just... didn't exist. Sure the ornaments came down, but the skeletal remains of Christmas stood in our living room as a monument to our evasion of basic responsibilities. 

One day, in late February or so, we realized we could be having friends over for dinner. We thought, ""Oh my god. We can't let people know we still have this tree!"" So we did what any logical couple would do and we hid it in the closet with a white blanket over it. You can imagine how terrifying it was in the beginning when you would get up to use the restroom in the middle of the night and see an 8 foot tall Christmas tree ghost looming in the doorway.

I don't know what the final straw was. Maybe it was the storage space we were losing by having a massive cloaked Douglas fir in our closet. Maybe it was that we missed using the blanket that had taken on a new purpose in life. Whatever it was, we knew we couldn't avoid this issue any longer. The problem of how to dispose of the tree still existed. We couldn't leave it at the curb, and we knew wherever we took it, it was going to leave a breadcrumb trail of humiliation straight to our doorstep. 

That's when the saw came out.

Into the wee hours of the night we carefully disassembled the tree until it was compact enough to fit into a cardboard box. By 2am we were covered in sweat and sap, but we were able to stealthily discard the box in a nearby dumpster. On that day, we vowed to never again let the disposal of the Christmas tree become an episode of Forensic Files. 

And now my shameful past is out in the open for the internet to enjoy. Happy New Year, all!

t3_knxfem,"TIFU by disputing contractors charge with my credit card due to poor quality, now my gf and I are paranoid they'll retaliate","I hired a company in mid November to reglazed my 1950's original neon wall tile white. When the owner came to give the estimate he said the end result will look like brand new white tile multiple times, and that verbiage was also listed on their website in multiple places. 

2 days after the reglazing was completed and I was able to go into the room I noticed I could see the original tile color through the white, and there were a bunch of blemishes and defects that made it look poorly painted tile. I emailed the company that day saying the issues, and they had the owner come out to inspect. 

Before he even looked at the work, he said I was crazy and there was no way the color was showing through and the aren't going to add another coat. Then as I was showing him the blemishes he said I was being too picky and that it's a 70yr old house and won't look new (not what they sold us). He spent about 20min touching up the blemishes and bad mouthing me thinking I could hear him. I asked him. For a partial refund as the outcome wasn't what we were promised during the estimate and he essentially told me to f*** off 

Luckily they let me pay with credit card, so I called up the CC company to ask about disputing this (I've never disputed anything before), and was informed I could dispute any amount between 0-100% of the $2,000 charge. I told the CC rep I want to think about disputing for a few days to see if the reglazing company would reach out, but saw that the next day I had the full $2,000 charge reversed in my account. 

I tried reaching out to the reglazing company saying I'd  pay half but will not be allowing them over agaib to add another couple coats after the way they were talking to me and my gf. They said I need to pay the full $2k amount. We've been paranoid that the owner is going to stop by to either cause property or physical damage for the last few weeks as there's been no resolve.

t3_knx58h,TIFU - By accidentally taking the wrong golf cart,"Obligatory didn't happen today.

Myself and 3 IRL friends who live across the UK all met up for a long weekend but the main purpose of the trip was a long overdue golfing expedition. We hadn't golfed together for several months and eventually we all had a weekend where our schedules all fitted together.

My friend who we shall call Jake is the expert in our group of finding places to golf and has some kind of UK membership which covers many national courses and clubs. Jake's membership also allows him to bring guests to the courses. Jake is also probably more aware than all of the group of my mobility and medical needs so he always makes sure the course or club we visit has a powered golf cart we can hire. 

The trip started out from our Hotel without too much issue. I do recall the breakfast at this hotel was probably one of the best I've had so at least something positive came from the day. We left the hotel and took a train for approximately 2 hours to a little village where we told by the Golf Course staff a bus would take us to the entrance of the course.

We arrived and booked in for 2x 18 hole games for the day with lunch inbetween. We got changed into sensible golfing attire (ugh!) and proceeded to get our powered caddy to begin the first round. We got to around hole 5 when we noticed we were being aggressively chased down by some old timer golfers who were clearly familiar with the course (this is important). 

This isn't normally an issue as our group as when this happens we stop at the hole to let players behind us go ahead because I'm so slow.

We got to hole 7 and my bladder helpfully decided it needed emptying again. Having a medical condition this wasn't surprising news to the group and Ryan gave me the keys to the cart and they said they'd continue with the hole. We have a gentlemans agreement in place over scoring and other such matters as every game I normally miss 1 hole. I agreed and said I'd be back shortly. 

For some reason that to the present date still remains unclear, the group that was behind us had almost caught up with us and were now putting on the Green of hole 6 but had parked their golf cart next to ours at the start of holes 6 and hole 7. 

Somehow I ended up taking the wrong golf cart, which had some of the other golfers very expensive and almost full sets of clubs onboard. I returned to the main centre, parked up and went into the changing rooms to do what needed to be done. I then left and went into the shop to pick up some more cold drinks. Got back into the cart and drove back to hole 7. My friends (and the other cart) were nowhere to be seen. Thinking they made progress I drove onto hole 8 and couldn't find them there. I drove onto hole 9 and by reaching hole 10 realised something was wrong. It was at this point I also noticed a red bag strap flapping around in the wind. None of us have red bags. On closer inspection I realsed this bag didn't belong to us, nor did any of the other 3 bags onboard. A feeling of ""Oh shit"" started to crawl up on me as the gravity of the situation begun to sink in.

To make matters worse, unbeknownst to me at the time, the old timers who were behind us had caught up and confronted my friends about why I had ""stolen"" their cart. My friends knowing this was extremely unlikely to be deliberate drove back to the centre to figure out what happened. The route they drove back to the centre, was not the same route I drove back to the hole. So we ended up driving past each other without realising.

Having now realised I had the wrong cart and my friends now missing, I redrove back to the centre and fortunately Jake was stood outside reception trying to call me. Jake then explained to me what I had done. I already had known what I had done and when he explained there were 5 or 6 angry old boys who wanted blood. He I'm sure took great joy in watching the look of white ice coming across my face.

I went inside and found the course manager and explained to him what I had done. As professional as he was, even he could not stop himself from laughing at the situation. Unfortunately for me, the old timers had driven into town to the local police station to report their clubs as stolen. One of them drove back to the centre to retrieve all their belongings from the changing rooms.

When the guy from the other group pulled up one of my friends loosely recognised him and beckoned him to come over. I then appeared and tried my best to apologise for what happened and explain there was a mixup of carts. He could not have been any less interested in anything I had to say. 

He went on a tirade about how the young have no respect for the elderly and every time I tried to respond was either spoken over or interrupted with sentances like ""You don't listen to answer or reply, you listen to learn"" and ""You have 2 ears and 1 month, do more listening and no replying"" Eventually I grew frustrated of the old fart and simply said ""If this is how you speak to young people it's no wonder they don't respect you. You're obviously not interested in my apology or explanation so I'm not going to entertain you any further. We're done. Your clubs are in the cart but we're finished"" he tried numerous times to interrupt but I simply kept talking.

I then suggested to Jake that maybe we should leave and golf elsewhere later in the afternoon or the following day. Jake, Ryan and Chris agreed this was a smart thing to do so we packed up and left. Eventually old boy sees us leaving and charges out behind us with his camera phone out. He then makes some remark about taking a picture of our license plate. 

Jake at this point started to get irritated and wished him luck when we'd be taking a bus. We got out of the clubs grounds and continued at short way down the path to the bus stop. He followed us and sat on a fence a little way up the road. But eventually a bus appeared which took us back to the railway station and we saw him hastily returning to the grouds. But the story more or less ends there as he never caught up with us and nothing further happened other than a ruined morning of golfing.

In closing, nothing was ever said about the incident to Jake by the club and to this day he still holds his UK membership thing and we have golfed many times since then without any issues. Although our group unanimously agreed we will never return to that speicifc club. Noone in the group ever heard from the Police either.

TL;DR

Went golfing with a group of friends. During the game I returned to the club centre to use the bathroom. Accidentally took the wrong golf cart which belonged to another group of golfers (which also contained a few bags of very expensive clubs). A further mixup happened when my friends drove back looking for me and I drove past them on a different route. Other group of golfers got super mad, reported their clubs stolen, one from that group then went on a tirade of condescending lectures on me when I tried to apologise. Didn't accept my apology. Morning of Golf ruined so we left.",12,0,tifu
t3_knwoof,TIFU by thinking with my dick and getting robbed for 20 bucks...twice,"Obligatory this didn't happen today, but a couple years ago. So this fuck up started with me browsing this dating site I had been using for a while, iv never had the best luck when it comes to online dating but I was still hopeful. 
      
      Out of the blue though I got a message from this girl, and it seemed like we hit it off right away, we were talking about cuddling and that possibly leading to other things. She then told me that she needed 20 dollars to pay her rent( yeah I know I'm stupid but I was thinking with my dick and It was only 20 bucks so I didn't think anything of it) 

     She sends me the address, and I begin my drive over there. 20 mins later I'm out front of her house waiting patiently when her and another girl come out of the house and I thought that was weird but I brushed it off. They got in the car and we exchanged hellos and she tells me that she needs to take the money to her landlord down the street and I oblige. They're both quiet and it seemed a lil fishy but I brushed it off to her being shy.

    So we get to this restaurant, and they tell me that they'll be right back. I wait and wait and wait but they never come back and I'm well aware of what happened so I just drove off, blown and sad. 

    Oh but that's not all, these girls were smart and let's just say I am not. I ended up deleting the app after that and continued with my life until another bout of loneliness struck and I redownloaded the app hoping things would be different. 

      Then I get that fateful message that fucked me for the second time. It was the same girls on a different account and since I was thinking with my dick once again I didn't connect the pieces. Things go exactly the same, we talk about cuddling and shit, then she did the same thing she did last time and told me she needed 20 bucks for weed this time, somehow it still didn't connect in my primate brain. 

    So i drive out there to a different house this time and they told me they would come get me from where I was parked. Once they got there I got out of my car and got into the back of there car and we drove off. About halfway through the ride I recognized who they were and just held my tongue becuaSe I had no idea where I was or how to get back to my car, so I just stayed quiet until we got to a gas station and her friend got out to get gas, to which I proceeded to ask the girl if we've met before and that they seemed familiar, she played dumb and said ""iv never seen you before in my life"" to which I just nodded my head

    We end up driving to the SAME FUCKING RESTAURANT that they robbed me at the first time and I was thinking fuck I know where this is going. They get out and come back 10 mins later saying they got the shit, so I thought maybe it won't happen again. Well we get back to my car and they tell to just follow them to their house. I happily comply and get out only for my ears to be assaulted by the screeching of tires as they peel out of there with my money. Let's just say I was seriously questioning my intelligence on the ride home...fucking twice.

TL;DR i got robbed by my date and her friend twice because I didn't recognize her right away and I'm not the smartest man",27,20,tifu
t3_knw72x,TIFU by getting a mouthful of something hard that left me worried I might accidentally swallow [NSFW],"(edit for clarity)

ok...so this was about 10 minutes ago..

Setup:

I  have a hobby. It's making bracelets from tiny 1.6 mm glass beads  (\~0.06in). When making these, you have to use a hardened needle that is  less than \~0.5mm thick. Oh, the needle is also a HUGE 9 cm long  (\~3.5in)... when whole.

That's the setup. Now for the feature:

So...

I'm  sat at my computer desk watching tv while sewing, and I pause. I place  the needle between my lips on the right, and the bracelet in the left.  (it's a gift for me, so no lurgy worries)

All is going well.

I change the channel, finish a write-up and go to grab the needle.

Well...  I forgot I was using a 9 cm needle and PUNCHED that cunt right into my  fucking face. Oh, it gets worse... It went right INSIDE my tongue.

The pain made me flinch my head backwards, and the needle hit my tongue bar head-on.

This  was the ""perfect storm!"" The needles hardened metal shaft snapped clean  in two, leaving around 2.5cm of the thing in there. (Don't believe  ANYONE who says it doesn't hurt if it's ""only the tip""!)

So, I was sat with one third  a sewing needle in my tongue and not a clue what to do.

I  could go to the NHS and get them to remove it for free; but, they are  overworked and under paid. So, I figured I'd extract it myself.

The  needle was head-on and against the tongue bar. The point was only just  below the surface and next to my hole, so... I formulated one of the  greatest plans known to woman or man...

I  removed the tongue bar, said a little prayer to any god listening,  aimed the point of the needle upwards... and hit it from the back. (aiming into my maw)

I  believe I wanted to say something akin to  ""MOTHER-FUCKING-TWAT-SLAPPING-WAFFLE-STOMPERS!!!"" but it came out as  ""AAAARRRRGGGGGHHHH!!!""

Ok. So the point was out. Now I just had to use forceps to pull it out of my tongue, towards the back of my throat.

GOT IT!

Thankfully  I managed to whip it out of my mouth before it got messy. My hole is  still sore and a little bloody, but... it could have been worse. At  least I didn't make the mistake of swallowing.

I am now going to take a lot of drugs in the hopethat the pain buggers off.

so... how is your NYE going?

TL;DR: I injected a sewing needle into my tongue and had to extract it myself.",21,7,tifu
t3_knvari,TIFU by not questioning why my doctor didn‚Äôt follow up with me about a chest X-ray,"TIFU by not questioning why my doctor didn‚Äôt call me about a chest X-ray

So like 2-3 weeks ago I started having chest pain and bad shortness of breath. I got sent home from work over it because Covid, but got tested and it was negative so I went to the doctor. 

They did a chest X-ray and gave me some steroids, and that was like 2 weeks ago, the steroids kind of made me feel better, but my doctor never called me about the X-ray. I‚Äôve had this type of chest pain kind of (thought not as bad) and it‚Äôs been pleurisy and so I get a chest X-ray and they‚Äôre uneventful. So I just assumed like eh it‚Äôs probably nothing. 

Well this morning they called me and asked if someone had followed up with me about it and I said no, and she was like oh no, you have pneumonia and you need to go get these antibiotics we ordered for you and come back when you‚Äôre done with them and get another X-ray. 

I was just like LOL oh shit

Like damn if I would have caught covid over the last few weeks it probably would have been a ripperino, I also realized I tried to give blood Tuesday but they deferred me because my hemoglobin was too low and that‚Äôs never happened to me

So always call and ask for a follow up or maybe you‚Äôll die lol

t3_knuz78,TIFU by becoming the 'Trash Man',"This kinda medium long I guess.


Okay so this just happened like 10 minutes ago and im still shaking from the embarrassment. So its new years eve today in India (just an hour to go from when im posting this to be 12 o clock) and for some reason I was completely oblivious of this fact, because I was under the impression that today is the 30th not the 31st!

So I live an apartment complex and every other day my family assigns me the duty of taking the trash out. And im free to do this whenever I please just as long as I do it. So being the perfectly anti social idiot that I am, I choose to take the trash out at midnight or close to midnight because of the fact that there are seldom few if any people that happen to be walking around the complex at this time of the night. So im basically free to look however the flip I please because thered be nobody around to see me. And Ive successfully pulled this off countless times, so its like a tried and tested plan okay?

So im out here looking like a complete homeless dude with my old and tattered sweats from like forever ago, messy hair and like the general look of a dude who hasn't slept nor taken a shower in two days (which is exactly what I am rn because im stuck at home and binging games and whatnot). So I literally look like a tired homeless junkie, you get the picture yeah?

In order to reach the trash bins, Id have to walk across the apartment complex through the apartment park to get to these bins which are located in the near side of the entrance. So its a bit of a walk really although not all that much. So as I mentioned before, I was clearly under the impression that today was the 30th and not the 31st (im an idiot I know shut up). So im like, oh this is just a normal night as any and I dont suspect a thing.

As I walking through the path, I see bright lights and feint sounds of music coming from the park and I rush over to see what's the dealio. Turns out, the residents have all got together to set up this outdoor gathering/party to celebrate new years and theres like a lot of people. And to make it worse there are also people whom im friends/acquaintances with among the crowd. And the only way to GET TO THE TRASH BINS is to walk through the park which contains the party... *instant facepalm*. And for some reason instead of turning back and not being lazy I decide to go through with it regardless! And to tell ya the truth, I dont really have a good excuse to why I decided to do that.

So aside from all the obvious stares and distant snickering I kept getting as I was walking past all these fancily dressed people, my mind was like Ive come this far, I just need stick with it, take out the trash and go back home. This is where it gets juicy... In the middle of walking through the party, MY FUCKING TRASH BAG TEARS?!!? SO NOW IVE LITERALLY LITTERED A PARTY  (cause a huge chunk of trash fell out) and im still holding the bag! So I panik and I literally heccin run to the bins with leaky trash! LEAVING TRAILS OF TRASH ALONG THE WAY, IN THE MIDDLE OF A PARTY IN A FRICKIN PARK. 

People literally staring at me with awe and disgust as I look behind after throwing the trash out to the absolute utter mess I made behind me. I tell ya, the whole frickin crowd was looking right at me, everything silent as a door nail except for the music in the background...

The..walk...of..shame...back...was...the...worst...moment...Ive...ever...experienced....in...my....life....

The pure unfiltered feeling of guilt and shame and disguist all mixed in this horrible cocktail of 'bad times' that Ive drank tasted so fucking horrible let me tell ya.

Eventually I got back home and im like okay whats over is over I cant change it. Suddenly, I feel a buzz in my pocket. It was my phone vibrating from a text message, it was the whatsapp group (with all the neighbouring kids who im friends with) that im part of. They have already been dubbing the incident the ""trash man incident"" and already started roasting tf out of me with it. This is great, just heccin great.

So yeah im never gonna hear the end of this and thats how I fucked up today.

TL;DR : I forgot it was new years eve today, went out lookin like a homeless dude to take out the trash. Had to walk through a small gathering of people celebrating, ended up having the trash bag I was holding tear up and leave trails of trash everywhere. My friends who were attending the event witness this incident and have started dubbing me the grand ol title of ""The trash man""

Oh and on an ending note, HAPPY NEW YEARS EVERYONE!",35,6,tifu
t3_knux04,TIFU by drinking too much and kissing a good friend of mine,"Actually this happened like a year ago, but I still remember it like it was yesterday.

At that time COVID-19 still wasn't a thing to worry about, so our annual neighborhood party took place anyway. As it was summer two girlfriends of mine and me decided to camp in their nearby garden after the party. The party itself was fun and late at night all of us sat down around a camp fire, told stories and listened to some music. Everything was going well, even though I was having way too much bowl punch.

So at 2 am we called it a night and went back to our tent. I don't remember anything after that, just being hung over the next morning. After I had breakfast with my friends and left for home, I started getting mysterious text messages from one of them. She asked me if I had any memories of what had happened last night. I told her, I didn't. Then she dropped some remarks, like 'You were that drunk?' 'I can't believe she (the other friend) didn't wake up of it'.

Within minutes, she had me totally scared of what the hell I had done the previous night. I begged her to tell me, no matter how weird it was. Finally, she gave in.

She woke up at about 4 am that night and proceeded to turn over when she accidentally hit me. I woke up, too.

Me: What are you doing?

She: Just turned around.

Me: I dreamed of you.

She: I'm sorry, that I woke you up.

And then I kissed her intensely.

It took me a while to process that. Finding out you're at least bisexual or lesbian and kissing a good friend which makes your relationship a little bit weird isn't exactly an easy thing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL; DR: I drank too much and had a blackout. Later I found out I kissed a female friend of mine. Through this kiss I found out I'm bisexual or lesbian and fucked up our relationship.",15,7,tifu
t3_knuhyn,TIFU by sleeping in the vicinity of my girlfriend,"To preface, I‚Äôm 17 and my girlfriend is 18. We‚Äôve been in a LDR for close to a year now. Every now and then, we‚Äôll be able, with parents approval, to stay with each other at one of our houses for a small period of time.

Last night, my girlfriend and I had been chilling in my basement (which is where she is staying) and we were both getting tired, and ready to go to bed. The issue with this was that we were both still craving to be with each other, and didn‚Äôt want to separate by the two floors we had been doing previously. We decided that the best way to try to do what we wanted but still appease my parents would be to have me sleep on a couch in our main room and she‚Äôd be on a couch in the back room. We did this, and it had been fine. 

When we woke up, however, my parents asked me whether or not I had slept downstairs. I was honest and said yes, but we‚Äôd made sure to do it in separate rooms to try to follow what they expected. Despite this, they still grilled me once my girlfriend had gone downstairs to change. They grilled me hard. Made me feel like shit. 

Now, I‚Äôm just sitting here, feeling like a failure because I love my girlfriend. I feel like shit and my parents are disappointed with me. I just don‚Äôt know what to do right now. Apparently choosing to love your girlfriend and sleep about 50 feet apart in different rooms means that I fucked up to the N-th degree.

t3_knofve,TIFU buying wine for a new roommate,"This was a few years ago, but remember it like yesterday.

While on internship in Brazil I got a new roommate. She was due to arrive the evening of this day. We'd had some contact beforehand through mail and she was up for a party planned for that day. Double reason for a good bottle of wine (which is quite expensive in Brazil). 

For those who haven't been to a Brazilian supermarket, they use VERY thin plastic bags and pack everything without you even having a chance of using your own bags. When I was almost back home, the bag with the wine decided to break. I was a bit sad, but accidents happen. I put the groceries inside, but on my way outside to clean up the glass I saw a trail of bloody footprints. Apparently the bottle fell onto my sandaled foot. When the guard came to check on me he panicked and called an ambulance, so here I was, in a foreign country with a tiny cut in a tiny toe, loaded into an ambulance (in the end a good call, because the tendon was ruptured).

When the poor roommate arrived there was no me, no party, no wine and only a dark house with a trail of bloody footprints.

TL:DR dropped the wine for my new roommate on a toe, cutting a tendon and leaving her to come home to a dark and bloody appartement instead of a party",20,2,tifu
t3_knstmy,TIFU by not pulling out,"Wasn‚Äôt today but I still want to share.

I had just turned 14. Me and my girlfriend went to a houseparty. We got horny and went to a bedroom to fuck. We were both virgins so we had no idea about sex. Neither of us had protection, so I promised her I would pull out. When I put it in, it felt like absolute heaven. My mind was absolutely blown. My head was empty, all I could think about is the warmth of my girl‚Äôs pussy. After a minute or two I cum. A lot. I got caught up in the moment and totally forgot to pull out. By the time I came back to reality, her pussy was leaking cum. I tried to convince myself that everything would be fine, and that we wouldn‚Äôt be parents. And now I have two cribs in my bedroom and clean poop every day. 

So, my advice, always wrap your willy, because you probably won‚Äôt be able to pull out, especially if you‚Äôre a horny virgin.

So a backstory, My friends partner was found out to be a cheat a few months before this but he forgave her and they moved on with their relationship

Prior to this me and my partner would frequently go round for evening meals and movies and alternatively they would come to our house.

So as usual we went round with pizza and had a nice meal and a few laughs. That was until their dog came into the living room.

The dog brought in a tugging toy and came straight up to me, so we played a little until the little genius realised if he nipped my hand (playfully) I'd let go and he'd win.

When he did this I said ""you're a cheat just like ""cheaters name"" ""

Needless to say the atmosphere dropped, I was horrified and looked over at my friend and the cheater and their heads were dropped, my partner was staring daggers at me and we quickly said our goodbyes and left.

Edit: just to clear up, I didn't purposefully say this, it was an in the moment, filter not activated comment that slipped out.

t3_kns6t9,TIFU by helping my mom setup Google Chrome on our home computer,"So, last night, my mom got an email from her work telling them that they're switching to a new system which should allow people to work together on documents even when working at home. (So a Google Docs kinda thing.) Seems innocent, right?

This morning, as I'm prepping my hearty breakfast of 8 pieces of toast, my (16, M) mom yells for me to come help her set up something on her computer (it's the home computer but I'm not **supposed** to use it that much and she uses it way more to work from home). She says they want her to install Google Chrome, instead of MS Edge which she's using now, for their new work app. What I tell her: ""Oh, for sure. That's simple."" What I'm thinking: ""Holy fucking shit, I'm doomed!"" Here's why...

I'm a teenage boy. I've had little sexual experience not involving my hand and some Nivea Men's Lotion, so when I'm feeling a bit.... \*rowdy\*, let's say, I have a few sites that I frequent to.... relieve some stress. Y'all know what I mean.

Since I don't want to risk my school's tech people questioning my Chromebook's web history, I often times (especially pre-Corona) would hop onto my home computer when I was home alone and yank the chain, or just browse some NSFW pics and vids on everyone's favorite site, Reddit. To be as inconspicuous as possible, I downloaded Google Chrome on our home computer so there was little chance of my mom opening up her browser and seeing something neither she or I wanted her to see. However, Microsoft Edge was acting up for some reason on one of the sites she uses for work and she needed that site to be functional in order to do work, so that was a problem. Her IT people recommended that she download Chrome on her computer since it was a better browser and would hopefully solve her problems.

Cue this morning....

I'm standing next to my mom and she says ""Help me download Google Chrome."" I figure that if I just download it again, maybe it will pop up all fresh and new and she won't see anything I've done on it. Well, I was wrong.

I downloaded it and opened it up and was welcomed to the background that I had set on Chrome myself, which told me that this wasn't what I wanted. Luckily, I had the bookmarks hidden, so she didn't see anything. I quickly closed the tab, said something along the lines of ""It's not working right, we need to re-download it"", and quickly erased all of Chrome's data before uninstalling it.

Long story still kinda long, I re-downloaded it and it was all fresh and clean for my mom to use, so that was a heavy TIFU evaded.

TL;DR: Mom needed Chrome on her computer which I use to look at \*nasty\* things, just barely managed to clear Chrome and download it brand new for her",8,7,tifu

So I did it and thought ""Well this isn't so bad"" then it started to burn. I am in terrible pain right now and it fucking sucks. It burns worse than I can ever imagine, if Hell is coming to me, then what hellfires do to my dick would be nothing compared to this. It burns still as I am writing this. I regret this immensely.

Instead of waiting for carpenter to do it by himself I thought I should do it as it was a fiber connection and it takes a whole day for ISP team to arrive if internet goes off by wire damage. My siblings had their online exams going on so couldn‚Äôt risk it. IDK, I was overthinking at that time or what but that was for sure the moment I fucked up. 

I took a sharp knife from kitchen, one of the sharpest but little one, and stood on chair to access the zip tie. Rotated the knife just to be cautious that it won‚Äôt damage any of those wires. Applied force to cut it and the knife cut through zip tie and went straight into my left hand I didn‚Äôt stab it like fully going in or thought my hand but managed to make a U-shaped cut under my left-hand thumb in which hand muscles were cut along with vessels and skin was hanging like towards outer side of my left hand.

So anyway, this has already happened, I grabbed my hand like literally Mr. Bean does after getting his hand hurt and started shouting like crazy to call my brother. There was blood on the floor and I took my hand to the sink to let him have a look at it and ask what should we do? Can this wound just be covered by putting wired gauze or should we go to the hospital? 

Hospital it was, as cut was deep from the start and just along the skin from the end. Took a clean piece of cloth and hold that cut firmly so no blood should spill and put my arms above my head so flow of blood is less on that area. Pain was enormous that there was this white cloak coming in front of my eyes and I thought I would faint out due to that pain.

I was admitted to the hospital as a result obviously. One of my friends works there, made phone call, asked him for a favor and he assigned a good surgeon in surgical emergency of that hospital. Doctor took a look at it and said you will get two or three stitches on your palm and have to give it a rest of a whole month to let that heal. This one mistake or act of hurry got me into this much trouble so yeah, I got two stitches on the edge of my left hand.

Later on, after I came back home, I saw carpenter cutting them same zip tie with heavy duty scissors with no issues at all and I was cringing like crazy! Overconfidence and having no skill about the situation can sure get you in trouble. I don‚Äôt hope this post will get that much upvotes or appreciation but do keep it alive to let other people know about it.

Line of fire of a sharp knife: swing a knife gets after it cuts a wire, cord, rope or something you wanted to cut.

So Always cut anything you want to cut in a way that knife moves away from you if it overshoots.

Me and the landlady have a friendly relationship but this was a new intimacy I didn't want. I sent her a quick text saying that a parcel arrived for me and would she mind forwarding it on, I would cover postage etc. She replied almost instantly to say she opened the parcel as there was no name (old people), and that the fancy wipes looked like a nice sample selection for her 2 year old grandson so she had given them to her son and his children for Christmas. I am MORTIFIED. 

The wipes themselves only say toy and body wipes on, but it is written underneath a huge Lovehoney logo. I used to babysit for her son and daughter in law and am truly horrified by the fact they will 99% think their elderly mother has bought them some sex wipes for their young children. 

My ex landlady is transferring me the money and I have told her that she ought to let her son know they were meant for me, as I doubt he will be able to recover if he thought that of his mum. Meanwhile, I am deleting her address from any and all accounts as quickly as I can.

t3_knpcvm,TIFU by offering to mow the lawn NSFW,"Obligatory ""this happened a couple years ago"". I was living with my parents at the time to save money while I went to college. I would of course help them with things around the house because that's the least I could do for their generosity. My dad has had chronic back pain and knew I would soon move out when I was done with college so he wanted to get a riding mower. I offered that I could mow the lawn still when he got it, partly because I'd never ridden a riding mower and thought it'd be fun.

So fast forward a month or so, me and my girlfriend are having some fun in my bedroom. My parents usually hang out on the opposite side of the house and usually they let us have our space when she's over. But apparently not today. We're both naked and my girlfriend has my entire dick in her mouth when I hear my mom excitedly say ""Lordlemming, your dad got that new riding mower! You should come out and learn to drive it!"" My girlfriend and I locked eyes for a moment and I responded ""I'll be right there!"" Because I didn't know what to do.

So I get dressed, tuck in my wet boner, and go outside.  My dad shows me how to turn it on and shift gears, I drive around for a few feet and then get off of it. Although this wasn't exactly the reason, it was a catalyst for wanting to move out despite saving money. Things were getting serious with my girlfriend and we knew a guy who would be our roommate so not a few weeks later I move out and never even now the lawn once with the riding mower.

t3_knp4ik,Tifu by getting waaay too high (i guess) and traumatizing myself,"Tifu by getting waaay too high and traumatizing myself¬†

Okay so this didn't happen today, it happened like a few months ago. But i can't forget what happened and I'm now terrified of weed. I still dont even know what really happened to me that night. It was a truly traumatic experience, not even exaggerating.

¬†Sorry if none of this makes sense, I only really remember some snippets of things, but just know going through this I felt 100x worse than im probably explaining it.

So my boyfriend ate edibles, like everyday. I was staying with him, so naturally he asked me to try with him sometime. The first time was nice. I felt giggly and light and airy and just good. It was a pretty cool sensation. The second time I think it was even better, it was like all my feelings were heightened and I could feel every single thing I was doing.

The 3rd time is when all hell (literally) broke loose. If I remember correctly, my boyfriend bought a blunt (i think its called, idk) to smoke, this would be my first time actually smoking as I had just eaten a gummy the other 2 times. This was probably the first mistake. I was bad at smoking, so idek if that did anything though tbh. So I ate a gummy instead, and then my boyfriend had also bought this weird, weed lemonade drink, so I had a little sip of that, like it was barely a gulp. This was probably the 2nd mistake.

It started off okay, i felt that weird sensation where anything i touched i could feel it travelling through my nerves to my brain. I felt like i could feel all my blood flowing through my body, it felt tingly and i hated that feeling.

All of a sudden i think i started getting dry mouth, so much that it became hard to swallow. Like i could feeling every, like, saliva going down my throat and it was just an all around bad feeling. It eventually got so bad i was scared to eat because i thought i would choke.

I decided to get up because maybe just sitting around made it worse since i wasn't distracted. So i got up and started running water in my bathtub (unrelated reason that has nothing to do with the story) and i think this is where the first hallucination started. Leaning over the tub I remember feeling like a black girl in the bronx in like the 90's or something (im black too so maybe thats why idk) I've never been to new york, but it felt really familiar. Like the whole bathroom transformed into this other bathroom looking out over the city.

Anyway that feeling wasn't baad, but everything that happened after that was bad. I remember going back to sit next to my boyfriend at some point, i think we were watching tv and i remember everything was moving slooooow. It looked all melty and stuff, and everyone's face became like a weird caricature of their real face, so like if the guy had a big nose, it just kept growing and growing until it was real big. I still couldn't shake that gross feeling that my throat my closing in on itself cos it was so dry. I tried drinking water but it didn't help.

Now this next part im not too sure what exactly happened, its kinda blurry to me, so i only remember it in fragments, but i imagined i was in a cabin in the forest, and my brain takes me back to that cabin whenever i think of this, even though i was just in my boyfriend's livingroom. In the cabin the lights were out and it was sunset, except the sky outside was teal. I remember feeling like my boyfriend and I weren't alone. Like there were other beings in the room with us, and it freaked me out. I thought someone had broken in, and they were sneaking around trying to get me. And then i wasnt me anymore, I was the thing trying to get me? And i just remember telling my boyfriend that I felt like there was a demon inside of me, or that I was a demon, something along those lines. He told me i was tweaking and that i was freaking him out, but i was even more freaked out.

Then i remember it felt as if i was thinking about everything and nothing all at once. I was so freaked out by this point that I¬† was googling how long weed stayed in ur system and all that junk, and it didn't seem like this would be letting up anytime soon. So then i had the bright idea to puke? Like if i puked it would wear off faster, so the next thing i know im in the bathroom puking, it was like I made myself puke (we had Indian earlier, boyfriend claims it was the indian that made me puke but I know for a fact that it was not the food that made me puke)

When i came out i felt 10x worse. All those thoughts, it was like there was a hole in my skull and they were just leaking out and i dont even remember what i was thinking about but it was just too much all at once, and it was like i could see them leaking out of my head, but i just couldn't stop it no matter what. And this is the part that scares me a lot, but i literally contemplated killing myself just to end it because i didn't know what to do, it was just bad. Sooo bad and i remember telling my boyfriend how bad it was (not the killing myself part) but he just kept telling me that i was tweaking and to stop, but i couldn't stop. I was so scared because why would I even consider that? I really didn't want to stick around and see how all this would play out, so i tried going to sleep. Idk how early it was, but i didn't care.

Sleeping didn't work at first, but then i ended up resting my head against my boyfriend's leg and that finally ended it all (not completely but I felt a heck of a lot better). It was as if he was water and my thoughts were like lava and he put the fire out so the lava could harden over that hole in my skull to stop the thoughts from falling out and then eventually I did fall asleep.

The next day i felt really sick, my stomach felt horrible and i was in bed all day. I remember that night and maybe the night after,¬† i woke up in the middle of the night to a few hallucinations. The one i remember the most is a slimy, green, floating hand pointing at me in the darkness. Terrifying, but surprisingly when i saw it I wasnt that scared, but that was it, i never did weed again.

My boyfriend bought the weed from a dispensary in the area, and he didn't experience what i did, so im quite sure it was just something wild with my brain. He's tried to get me to do it again, but i refuse. Im not in the mood to go through any of that ever again.¬†

I always thought weed was good and it could never have this effect on anyone because that's what they tell you (not knocking weed, just now i know it aint for me), but, man, i was so scared.

‚òÜTldr; I had weed, I probably got too high and had a very traumatic experience. I'm scared of weed now.‚òÜ",8,13,tifu
t3_kngs9n,TIFU going to the store while still recovering (NSFW),"Over the Most Wonderful Time of the Year, I had the displeasure of enduring the worst bout of hemorrhoids and anal fissures I have ever had. I was in bed for days, spent at least $60 on supplies, and was in tears/had nausea/ felt like fainting from pain. It was no normal bout of this. So when it became painful to poop, I held my poop. That of course made the situation worse because it had to come out eventually. Had my partner buy me a sitz bath and $30 lidocaine fueled butt cream, as well as wipes and cooling cream and the regular stuff and eventually even a prescription. 

Fast forward to today. It‚Äôs been a pretty good day for my butt. Still in recovery but it‚Äôs not bleeding profusely every time I take a dump. However, I got my period yesterday, so now I‚Äôm contending with that mess too. 

I‚Äôve got a $100 gift card and a home improvement project and this money is just burning a hole in my pocket. Finally, I think, I can go out shopping for these specific parts. I prep my ass before I go with some cream just in case and head out. The store is about 7-8 minutes away. Everything is fine. The weather is even a bit warm. It‚Äôs good to get out of the house. 

I park and head into the store and first visit r/plants cause I love me some clearance plants. When I get over to the indoor plant corner though, my butt is feeling a little itchy. I need to scratch it or adjust or something. The corner is dark, but I don‚Äôt risk it. I make this super long trek to the bathroom which feels like it‚Äôs a mile away. I‚Äôm zooming down the aisle while clenching my ass cheeks. The itching is getting worse and I‚Äôve got a death grip on this buggy. Finally I bust into the biggest stall, drop my pants, and pop my foot up on this nasty toilet. I grab toilet paper and scratch at my ass hole. Still itchy burny. I rub some more. Now blood is dripping down onto my pants, fat red drops from my period. Nothing can be done. I decide I must leave immediately. I haul itchy ass to the door, wiggling and squirming uncomfortably the whole way. I can‚Äôt imagine that my face was anything but a betrayal of my secrets.

I bust out the front doors. My car is parked next to a truck. The man is standing outside of his truck, and in the cool evening breeze, papers from a three ring binder are blowing away in the wind. Fuck fuck fuck I think as I get closer. There is no way I can help this man. As I reach him he says it‚Äôs work papers. I feel like such an asshole, but all I say is oh no, hop into my car and leave. 

I call home and say no body better be in my bathroom when I get there, I‚Äôve got a butt problem. When I get home I head straight to the toilet, fill up the sitz bath with hot water and dunk my everloving holes in it. Some relief later, I stand up to see that the water is all bloody, with chunks, and that I‚Äôm dripping pink water all down my legs onto the white bathmatt. Clean up, apply cream. I‚Äôm staying in bed the rest of the day. 

Tldr got no shopping done at a home improvement store because my itchy ass wouldn‚Äôt stop being a butthole.",1,2,tifu
t3_kniw54,TIFU By Rolling My Boss's Trailer Down a Hill,"So, this happened on Saturday. To start off, I should probably explain my job and give a little background. I work for a rich guy who lives about half an hour away from me. Basically, I do whatever he needs me to do on his property, whether that be mowing the lawn, bucking hay, fixing his arena for his horses, or doing landscaping (I don't mean landscaping like making gardens, I mean like smoothing out a hill or excavating a hill to make an extra parking spot for his wife).

Well, I went out to work on Saturday, thinking that I'd work for a few hours and go home when my foot started hurting (I choose my own hours and I have a stress fracture in my foot). Around 2pm, my foot started hurting, so I told his wife that I was going to head home because of it. She said that was fine. Right as I was about to leave, my boss ""asked"" me to stay and remove the dirt that had built up from him excavating the hillside that week without me there. I was like, fine, whatever, I'll move dirt for a few hours since it's 90% operating machinery. So I hook up his tractor to his triple axle dump trailer and start filling it with the excavator. Once the trailer is full, I hop into the tractor to drive the dirt down the hill to the dumping spot.

While I am backing up, I hear a thumping sound, which I thought was odd, but it may have just been some rocks or something. After I had backed up from the flat area to where the hill starts sloping down, I hear the thumping again. Once, twice, and then suddenly the trailer is rolling down the hill without the tractor that was supposed to be attached to it.

About 20 yards behind where it had started rolling were some rocks, and I mean ROCKS, they were probably 400lbs+ and 3-4 feet in diameter each. The trailer ends up with the right tires and back axle perched on some of these rocks.

I approach the trailer to assess the damage, to see that the wheels on the rear axle were no longer parallel to each other. The trailer was stuck so badly on these rocks that we had to use both his tractor and his excavator together to get the trailer unstuck. Turns out, when you're distracted by pain, you forget to do things. Things like close the latch on the trailer hitch so that it doesn't bounce off the ball on the tractor. It's the little things that'll get you, I guess. And yes, I do take full responsibility for this happening, it's my fault for not double checking the trailer before I started using it.

Luckily, there was no structural damage to the trailer, it was just the axle which had been bent from slamming into a bunch of rocks at probably 20mph and the rear door bar which had been bent by the force of stopping the dirt. It ended up only costing $700 and some to replace the axle and straighten the bar, unlike the 3-4 grand I had at first expected after seeing the crash.

TL;DR I stayed at work after I knew I should've gone home, made a rookie mistake, and ended up sending my boss's trailer down a hill into some boulders.",4,0,tifu
t3_knjql5,TIFU by dropping my juul in the toilet,"
God, I am so fucking embarrassed just writing this, but hopefully a few people get a laugh from it. 

To start off, I‚Äôm 20, still living with parents. Yes I know vaping is bad, I intend to quit. But I have a lot of other self destructive habits which are way worse than a nicotine addiction. Anyways. 

I was getting ready to hop in the shower earlier today, and I happened to leave the toilet lid open. I took a few hits off the vape, as you do. I was butt naked, the floor was wet, and suddenly I was on my ass, cheeks against the tile floor, and I heard a splash. *My. Heart. **DROPPED***. 

Luckily the toilet hadn‚Äôt been used recently, so the water was ‚Äúclean‚Äù. Lo and behold, at the bottom of the bowl, my Blue Razz Lio disposable vape pen shimmered in the water. 

I panicked. If I flushed the vape, it would 100% clog the toilet, and I‚Äôd have to explain why a nicotine device was lodged in the pipe. I am not a man who can face his mistakes. So I did what any reasonable person would do. 

I found a Walmart bag in the cupboard, put it over my hand like I was about to pick up dog poo, and plunged my hand into the toilet. Big. Fucking. Mistake. In my panic, I neglected to check the bag for any holes. By god, I sure did find them quick. 

Let me paint a picture of my situation: I‚Äôm ass naked, shoulder deep in my toilet bowl with a grocery bag wrapped around my fist like some kind of ghetto surgical glove, reaching desperately into the pipe to retrieve a vape device. My dick is pressed against the cold ceramic of the toilet, and my eyes are watering. 

I finally grab it. The evasive blue razz vape slides into my hand. I then make my next critical mistake. In my haste to remove my hand from the toilet water, I jerk my hand up, splashing myself in the face with toilet water. I don‚Äôt even care. My pride has been stripped from me. 

I wrap the vape in ten layers of toilet paper and dispose of it in the trash can. Fucking toilets, man.

TL;DR: fisted my toilet bowl to retrieve my stupid vape so it didn‚Äôt clog the pipe, wound up with toilet water on my hands and face",0,7,tifu
t3_knlia6,TIFU by getting a handjob.,"So recently I started talking to this amazing girl and we had been on just one date before yesterday, when she invited me over for a ""buzzfeed unsolved date night"" (something that we bonded over on our first date). 


I was sure that she was interested in me and so was I. But I was a bit unsure if it would be the night we have sex since it was just our second date. Nevertheless, as a responsible person I am, I bought a condom and jerked off before hand (less chance of pregnancy). And just like that the date night begun. We were on her couch, watching buzzfeed unsolved with some soda and wine (I don't drink). We were watching the one where Shane and Ryan visit Annabelle which I already had seen but saw again just for her. During the end of it she started getting a bit cozy. Then she paused the video and we kissed. Now I was sure I'm getting laid tonight. 


Now we are going at it and started undressing each other. Then she gets to my crotch. I was already hard from us cuddling so when she took out my dick it was hard and long. Now, I think I should have mentioned that SHE HAD SUPER LONG ACRYLIC NAILS. 


Those sharp wolverine claws made me worry but my mind was completely taken over by horniness and my penis was taken over by her hands. So we were kissing and she's stroking it. And all of a sudden, she decides to go lightning fast on my poor guy (women, our schlongs are not detachable please have some mercy). Before I could react, I already had scratches. Interestingly, it did not hurt that bad. Or either I was too horny to feel pain. She apologized in a hurry and asked if I was ok. I said I was. Then we continued and she let me smash. Also, got some scratches on my back. Had a hard night sleeping.


Fast forward to today morning, my best friend is now making jokes about it all morning. But atleasy we are going to see each other again. She loved my schlong y'all. That's a win.


TL;DR - Date with long acrylic nails left her marks on my dick and back and couldn't sleep at night.",0,24,tifu
t3_knn76j,TIFU by making a Black man think I was racist and afraid of him robbing me,"This happened pre-covid, but thought I'd share. Sorry if the format is weird, I'm on mobile.

A little back story here, im (22F) extremely forgetful. So every time I was out and about, I'd store the trash id accumulate throughout the day in my winter jacket pockets and forget about it leading to 2 pocketfuls of straw wrappers, receipts, candy wrappers, etc.

One cold winter night, I was taking the bus home. The bus was mostly empty, but a young Black man was sitting across from me. I didn't think much of him, just another person on the bus. As we waited for the bus to leave, I figured the best way to pass the time is to listen to music. This is a habit of mine, every time I'm on transportation, bus, train, etc I always take my wired headphones out and listen to music to pass the time. But during the winter months, when I wear that winter jacket with pockets full of trash, I start another bad habit. Looking at people to make sure they don't see all the trash falling out of my pockets as I try to untangle my wired head phones from the straw wrappers, candy wrappers, etc. It was mostly the social anxiety, what would they think of me if they saw all of this trash in my pockets? They'd take me for a slob. 

On this particular night though, it didn't cross my mind how it looked. A young white looking woman (spaniard) looking to and fro from a Black man with her on a mostly empty bus late at night? No, this did not cross my mind, all I could think about was the trash wrapped in my headphones and making sure he didn't think of me as this disgusting pig. 

He almost immediately noticed, leaned over to me and said ""im not gonna rob you"" for a second I was confused, but then it clicked in my head and I felt like the biggest jackass in history. I sheepisly apologized and told him the real reason, then wipped out some of the trash in my pockets. I still feel like an AH

t3_knmn0j,TIFU by leaving my projector out next to the bed,"Naturally, this happened a few days ago. 

I recently got a cool portable projector. It‚Äôs small, wireless, and almost looks like a large black pop can. I put it on a tripod next to the bed to project on the wall. 

A few days ago I had a contractor over at the house to estimate some remodeling work in the bedroom. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it but when my girlfriend got home she immediately asked if the projector was up when the contractor was over. 

I said yes and she laughed a bit and said something like ‚Äúyou know it looks like there‚Äôs a camera pointed at the bed.‚Äù 

Sure enough, to the untrained eye it looks there‚Äôs just some sort of webcam setup pointed directly at the bed. It‚Äôs been three days and the guy hasn‚Äôt responded to my email or call. Pretty sure he thinks he walked into some sort of amateur adult entertainment setup. It also probably doesn‚Äôt help that I have other cameras and gear around the the room because we recently moved and it‚Äôs not put away. 

I‚Äôll put it away before I try to get another estimate.

t3_knmdz6,TIFU by not switching my throwaway account causing my religious mom to find a NSFW post,"This happened a couple hours ago. 

For some context, I (F19) was born and raised in an extremely religious household. My parents homeschooled me and basically sheltered me my whole life. 

Earlier today, I made a post talking about my experience tonight masturbating. I used a throwaway account because my main one has my art that I post and sell. I don't want to repeat the same post, but it was a bit crude (something I'm totally not used to). 

Every night, my mom goes through my phone and checks everything. I am used to this routine and never have anything to fear. Except tonight. I was talking with a few people in the chats and forgot to switch accounts with my main one. 

My mom saw my post and went insane. I'd rather not repeat what she said. She made me pray for half an hour straight and beg God for forgiveness. Meanwhile, she's throwing out all my art supplies and my dad is taking down my bedroom door. 

She told me that as soon as we're allowed to travel, we're going back to my home country and getting married. This is probably just an empty threat as she's said this before for other situations. 

She is currently sleeping next to me in the living room because I can't be trusted anymore. My source of income was from my paintings so it's not like I can do that anymore. I am planning on moving out soon though. 

In all fairness, it is my fault. I made that first post for attention and should've just kept it to myself. 
My parents do mean well and only want the best for me. They are strict but they never were abusive physically. 

Anyways, in the words of my favourite singer:  goodbye everybody, I've got to go.


Edit: thank you so much everyone for your support and ideas. I do realize that this is abuse and very extreme compared to most people. However, this is so common in Muslim households. A girl has to stay 'pure' for her husband. I do plan on moving out with a friend very soon without them knowing. I didn't realize mental abuse was a thing. 

To answer some questions, I was born and raised in Canada. My home country is somewhere in the Middle East (not Pakistan as many assumed). All of my siblings lived a sheltered life as well until they got married. I'm the youngest one. I hope to start university sometime next year, as I wasn't allowed to apply last year. 
 
Also, to all the Muslims threatening/insulting me privately, it's okay. Nothing you say would ever be worse than what my mom called me last night lol. This post was never intended to bash Islam at all. I'm really sorry if it hurt your feelings.

 I wish everyone a happy new year and nothing but good vibes ‚ù§Ô∏è May 2021 be a much better year for us all.

I worked nights in a restaurant so it was late by the time we finished and I‚Äôd usually prefer a drink with the gang for decompression so when I got home I‚Äôd just drop my clothes next to the bed climb in and go to sleep. On the nights that I left a bottle of wine in the fridge ‚Äòfor us when I get home‚Äô. 95% of the time I‚Äôd come home early and the wine would be gone and she‚Äôd be down and out for the night in bed. So coincidentally enough, on some of the nights I left a bottle of wine for ‚Äòafter work‚Äô I would stay out late with the boys, not getting into any trouble, just hanging out drinking, smoking and bullshitting. If I got home after 3am, she who must be obeyed would be code red- sleep somewhere else - Mad. So if I got back to the apartment after 3 I would quickly undress in the hallway outside of the apartment, as quietly and slowly as possible I would turn the key and open the door to the apartment. If the bottle was gone I‚Äôd drop my clothes next to the bed and climb in. However if the bottle was still in the table with 2 glasses left for effect, then there was trouble‚Ä¶there was never any trouble. The bottle was empty when I slid in at 3:46 on the oven digital clock, I tiptoed towards the bedroom when I heard the sound of the bed springs creaking the way they do when she‚Äôs getting out of bed in the middle of the night. Anyone who‚Äôs spent any time masturbating in the living room knew that sound very well. Or maybe it was just me, anyways, the bed springs play their jewelry box ballerina chime of doom as I drop my clothes and dove for the kitchen and start to pour myself a glass of water. ‚ÄòWHAT DO YOU THINK YOU‚ÄôRE DOING COMING HOME AT THIS HOUR!‚Äô
‚ÄòWhat are you talking about?‚Äô I say trying to sound sleepy but just coming across as more drunk than I was. ‚ÄòI was in bed and I just got up for a glass of water.‚Äô

So a few days ago I helped get a yellow lab out of a shelter and brought him to a boarding facility until he goes to his forever home. The rescue I work with was bothering me to get good pictures and video of him for them to post on social media, so today I stop by and take him into the backyard play area of the boarding. Figuring the content wasn't good enough I decided to take him out for a walk/jog down the street. Keeping in mind the employees told me he's  a ""runner"" I made sure to keep him close by. I stop by the car first to switch the slip leash I was using for a collar and more sturdy leash...this is where I fucked up...
As I got the collar on him I thought I was holding onto the correct leash, turns out that was false because as soon as the collar clicked he took off running with the leash in tow. That's when the chase ensued.

As soon as he reached the street he was in the middle of it. The road is 2 lanes on each side separated by a cement sidewalk area with trees (not meant for pedestrians). This is a notoriously busy street in the middle of the afternoon, running against traffic with my about 20 yards behind him going as fast as I can waving my arms like a madman in an attempt to stop the traffic. With cars on one side of the road slamming on their breaks not to hit the dog and the cars on the other side staring and wondering why I'm running in the middle of the road, one man had the kindness to pull his truck over in an attempt to help. As the dog approached the man, he pulled a quick juke move to the right, cutting across more cars down a side street. Now out of my sight I get to the corner, a random woman pulls over and offers me a ride to find him. So I hop in, we finally get close to him but as soon as I get out of the car he sees me and runs even faster, turning left onto another busy street and the chase continues. He eventually makes another right down one more side street again out of my sight. As we make the right turn I see someone was FINALLY able to grab his leash and hold onto him until I got there. I walked him the 1.5 miles back to the kennel, where my car door was still wide open from the start of the debacle. So big thanks to the strangers who were willing to help and make sure I got him back safely.

Many students before me have had their phones stolen, and there are even documentaries about the stolen-phone market in the traditional market place. So anyway there I am walking around, when a man starts to follow me. I feel very harassed but keep going along on my way. Finally I realize, my phone has been stolen by this man! I freak out and take a taxi over to the coordinator of this program, who helps me to buy a new phone (probably also stolen) from the market. 

Ten days pass and life is good and fine, until, one day, I am in a new town with a friend of mine. Once I arrive at her house, I reach into my pocket to grab my phone and show her a picture. And what do I find, other than an EMPTY POCKET. I absolutely panic, searching around, crying.

In October, i was trying to have fun on my family's side-by-side four wheeler (while home alone, which is part of the fuckup). I, in my absolutely enlightened state of stupid mind, decided to see how fast i could get it. I didn't slow down when i should have slowed down, so to avoid hitting a fence, i decided, once again in an enlightened state, to try to turn to avoid the fence without slowing down at all. As we all know from Newton's Laws of Motion, an object will continue moving at a constant velocity unless acted on by an outside force, which is why turning in a car pitches you to the side. Basically, i turned without slowing down and ended up flipping the side-by-side onto it's side, managing to get my ankle under it in the process. So here I am, stuck on my knees, going into shock, and not able to feel my left leg from my ankle down, waiting for the ambulance and the police to get there to lift it off of me. For 20 minutes. I ended up spending the weekend in the hospital on more drugs than you could imagine. Now i have a cool story with scars to go with it, 2 screws in my ankle, and almost a month of missed school days once I'm done with PT.

They didn't even have Dr. Pepper when i got out of surgery. They asked if I wanted pop (i hadn't eaten since about 1:30 the day before, this was at about 5 pm) and they only had mountain dew or coke :(

TL;DR I flipped a side by side, got some cool scars, a story, a month of missed school, and 2 screws in my ankle. And didn't even get dr pepper after surgery.",8,4,tifu
t3_knksbe,TIFU Telling my friends my junk doesn't work,"So today I just got back to work after catching the flu and having to get tested for COVID. Thankfully, no COVID, but very much still had a flu.

When I got home from work I decided to have a couple drinks with friends and let loose for a bit and we started talking about being sick and how they treat you as if you are just playing hooky and trying to have a poor man's vacation. 

I decide to chime in on the conversation and wanted to tell them how my job treated me when I was sick these past several days. 

I was intending to tell them, ""I was worried my work was going to be a dick about it."" 

What I said instead, ""I was worried my dick wasn't going to work.""

Absolutely petrified I just left the room... And I'm sitting here dying inside by how much I made it worse by not even correcting myself or anything. I just froze and left... They are never going to let this die.

TLDR: I mixed up words and said my dick doesn't work and then left without saying anything.",9,7,tifu
t3_knkirg,TIFU by chasing an invisible home intruder,"I was watching Jeopardy on the couch with ze wife, it was late, dark and cold outside.  Suddenly, in the middle of our late friend Alex Trebek describing some clue, we hear a voice inside the house - loud and close - say, ¬´¬†HELLO!¬†¬ª in a goofy, taunting way. Confirmed wife also heard someone in the house, very close, not the TV.

Initiate freak out mode.  Doors locked.  Kids are asleep upstairs, immediately check their rooms while wife watches the basement steps.  Upstairs clear, kids asleep.  Check all bathrooms, cabinets etc.  All that‚Äôs left is the basement, where I recently turned off the electrical breakers because of an issue (no lights.). 

Decide, logically, to call the cops because whoever said HELLO is almost certainly in the basement.  Cops show up, flashlights on / hands on weapons go down and search the basement, help with another search upstairs.  House totally clear.  Cops were cool about it and we filled out a quick report, but totally bizarre because all the doors were locked, including mechanical locks that can only be opened from the inside.  

Fast forward after a night of fitful sleep, I realize there‚Äôs one place I should check.  My Amazon Alexa app.  Yep.  My recently installed ¬´¬†Samuel L Jackson¬†¬ª celebrity voice was activated by Trebek, who said ¬´¬†the centennial exposition...¬†¬ª, which our friend Mr Jackson heard as ¬´¬†Hey Samuel Hey!¬†¬ª, leading him to enthusiastically reply and me enthusiastically feeling like a complete dumbass.

TLDR: called the cops bc we had a home intruder taunting us in the middle of the night, turns out it was Samuel L Jackson on Alexa triggered by Alex Trebek on Jeopardy.",205,33,tifu
t3_knkczv,TIFU by Going to the Bathroom Before Leaving Home,"I've finally recovered from this enough to talk about it. NSFW to be safe. So obligatory not today, but a few weeks ago to about a month ago, I had my usual shark week. I've been really good about changing products related to that time of the month. But I've also taken up smoking weed during quarantine. And every friday night, my mom and her siblings all play poker together and I usually join them.

Normal friday night and shark week. I 'garden' a little while I'm getting ready, achieving a nice calm. Poker games had been getting tense lately - as of typing this it's been a few weeks since I've played because of the toxic environment - and I was getting stressed and I swear, period cramps are so much better when you're high. So it gets time to leave home, I use the bathroom because I hate changing my tampon outside the house. Guess what I forget to do?

My ass of dumbness did not replace the tampon. I remembered to take the old one out. I freebled on accident for at least five hours. I was wearing new pants (leggings), just bought them that week (I washed prior to wearing, covid paranoid) and yes, I got blood on them.

Good news is, I don't think I bled on anything other than my pants and underwear as the passagner's seat of my mom's van has no stains from this. I did feel wet at some point, I was not that high and by the time I'd arrived at my uncle's, I was not high, but I thought it was from me sitting on the ground outside after I was out of the game and waiting for my mom to be ready to drive me home (she was still playing). 

I laughed about it when I discovered it and told myself no more 'medication' before using the bathroom, have since gone to the bathroom high but have not made that mistake again. But I have checked a few times to make damn sure I remembered to replace the blood containment device. I did not ruin my pants, luckily. I honestly could not point out which pair they were now as I don't completely remember and there is absolutely no evidence anything that can bleed wore them but I have worn them several times since but RIP that pair of underwear, they were ruined before but they look worse now but I don't care about the panties. My pants weren't ruined, that's the important part.

TL;DR, I tried to change my tampon while high, only succeeded in removal and freebled in new leggings. I managed to get the blood out of the leggings.",10,2,tifu
t3_knk4l2,"TIFU: End of the year, been unemployed but didn't seek benefits and now I'm out of savings."," 

(I'm sorry if this isn't the place to post this but I don't know where else to ask. Mods pls let me know / point me in the right direction &lt;3 )

Is it too late to apply for unemployment? I was laid off in March/April working construction in Wisconsin for my fathers company as Covid-19 hit. He ended up getting sick and needing a heart transplant. I was too afraid to go through the process as I have never beforehand and didn't want to feel like it was something I needed. But my mom pressured me to apply, so I did and was granted something like \~$230 a week or month or something like that. I don't remember what I applied for or anything, nor did I accept any of the money. I don't even have the papers they sent me. Now I haven't worked all year and still cant due to Covid-19 and I'm down to my last few hundred in my bank acct. IM still afraid cause I don't want to have to go out and get a job until a vaccine as my father is immuno-compromised.

SIDE NOTE:

To explain a bit of how we got here and why I struggle to do basic shit ---

I suffer from bipolar disorder and wasn't able to get on state healthcare until the start of 2020 and have waited ALL year for a psychiatric appt, WHICH is in 9 hours, so hopefully I will come home with my first bipolar prescription in over 6 years. I've been struggling most my life with this and its really starting to cause issues in my life.

Am I able to inquire with my psych about disability benefits? Anything at this point would help.

P.s. there's always more to this story, but I'm far to exhausted to write about it and I'm sure most of it isn't relevant.

TLDR; TIFU : I didn't take advantage of unemployment when I should have due to a number of reasons. Now I'm running out of money faster than I had calculated I would and I'm about to miss bill payments.",0,5,tifu
t3_knj15h,TIFU talking about woman issues at work,"Back when I graduated high school, I started working at Gamestop. I've got a slew of stories from that place, which, yeah, who wouldn't working at Gamestop. I was a Game Advisor. Never allowed to work alone and always out on the floor embarrassing myself. 

There was one night that I was working with a key-holder, (who we will call) Alexis. For the most part, anyone who was above me was great, and so was she. We had many of the same interests besides games and we didn't hold much stuff back. This night was somewhat busy, not the worst I'd ever seen, but enough that getting duties outside of customers finished was far tougher than it should be. 

There always came a certain time of the evening that everything would slow down up until closing time. When that time came around and everyone had left, Alexis just groaned saying, ""I am in so much pain. I'm on my period.""

I was still young, still wondering if that's okay to say, but I couldn't help but laugh and respond with, ""Same!"" because, yup, I too was on my period and knew exactly what she was going through.

She went on to suggest that we should sit on the ground behind the counter, relax and put the Gamestop labels on the cases. We'd just pop up if we hear the door open (which made a sound, so we could tell). I agreed. This was why I loved a lot of my co-workers, they were chill and understanding. 

I sat down on the ground, got a tape of labels ready and went at it. Found the right disk, stuck it on there and moved on to rinse and repeat. The entire while, Alexis and I went on to talk about how lousy periods were. We spoke about funny experiences, painful experiences, the first time we got our periods. Both of us just let our words roll off our tongues. I think we were both just sick of it and needed to confide into someone. There were some things I said to her that now only my hubby knows about. (Ya'know, them gross details.)

We had talked for at least 30 minutes when I noticed something above us and a low voice saying, ""Can I get this game,"" and showed us one of the empty cases from the floor. 

The speed at which my jaw fell, heart sank and I sprung up could be comparable to a sloth, because I barely moved. Alexis on the other hand, she was a ninja. She scooped herself off the floor, rung the man up, bagged up his stuff, sent him on his way and turned to me with horror in her eyes. 

We could have sworn everyone was gone. The door never opened. It NEVER opened. The blaring sound it made was enough to warrant our attention. This man, he must have been behind one of the displays when we thought everyone was gone. The store was considerably small. I can't help but wonder if he was just standing around the store, waiting for a moment to approach us, yet unsure if he should or if it'd be bad to interrupt such an ""interesting"" topic. Did he debate whether he should leave? He didn't make a *PEEP.* We didn't hear any scuttling, any shoes, any movement. Did he just stay still the entire time?!

After he left, Alexis informed me to keep it between us. Something happened though, he must have said something, because later that week everyone was called in for a meeting. And, the meeting was essentially about being careful about what you talk about in the store... some customers may be sensitive.

TL;DR Me and my co-worker spoke in detail about how terrible periods are while a customer was inside the store that we didn't know about and my Boss found out.",16,7,tifu
t3_kniwkd,TIFU by legally changing my wife's name to Arronna.,"Obligatory on mobile and didn't happen today. More like 10 years ago.

My wife and I got married in 2010. I was in charge of the marriage license. That was my one job. My wife handled EVERYTHING else.

We agreed that she would take my last name. I filled out the forms and changed her last name to ""D2423"".


I received the marriage certificate and saw D2423 on both of our names and thought ""yay, thank you California."" (Gay marriage wasn't Nation-wide yet)

We have the ceremony, and enjoy ourselves in the newlywed-bliss. Then she looks over the marriage certificate.

She stares at me, ""Laura, what's my name?""

I was thinking she was just excited about her last name: ""Arianna D2423"" I said flirtatiously.

""Well according to this marriage certificate, my name is *Arronna D2423!*"" 

I looked at the certificate more closely. It seems that my sloppy writing caught up to me. The IA looked like an RO to the county clerk.

We never bothered fixing it, but it's on all her legal documentation. She reminds me of this F-up any time she messes up.

""I messed up, but I didn't legally change your name!""


TLDR: I sloppily wrote my wife's name on our marriage license request and didn't check it before submitting it. This resulted in my wife's name being changed from Arianna to Arronna.",43,25,tifu

I have a bad gut, been tested for Crones, had a colonoscopy and all that jazz and have been ‚Äòcleared‚Äô, what ever that means... Some foods/drinks set me right off.

I‚Äôm on holiday with my wife and kids. The first actual family holiday with just us (gotta thank Covid for the reasons we came to this) anywho, had an awesome day out with the fam, went to an awesome restaurant, and ate an awesome meal, also, had a couple of yum wines with my steak (sorry vegos/vegans, I do like your life choices). My kids dessert arrived, my wife‚Äôs didn‚Äôt, we waited around for about 10mins after the kids had finished theirs and the restaurant hadn‚Äôt put it through, all good. We leave. (That‚Äôs important because in the past I can tell when my bowels are going to open), yeah nah, not last night...

We leave. Wifey grabs an ice cream from a nearby shop and I take the kids to the car to buckle them in. And that‚Äôs when it starts... after belting my 6yo son into his seat I find myself standing upright, squeezing my arse cheeks tighter than the rope used on an experienced bondage participant. Problem is, I couldn‚Äôt tap out or escape with a safe word. Wifey has collected her ice cream and the oncoming onslaught began. I rang her to attempt her to expedite her walk to the car, she just looked at me from the distance, pointing to her ice creams, signaling she couldn‚Äôt answer her phone. 

A poo-nami ensued. I penguin walked a few feet to the front passenger door and froze. About a liter of stomach fluid ensued uncontrollably from my bowel, fortunately restrained somewhat by some tight fitting jocks. By the time wifey caught my eye she knew what was up... our hotel was only a few minutes drive from the incident so paper bags were lay down and I was as rigid as a power pole trying to prevent my sagging arse from touching the seat of the car all the way to the hotel. 

Arriving at the hotel, wifey ran inside and retrieved a towel, two wet hand towels and a pair of clean shorts. I cleaned myself up in the hotel car park, all the while a homeless dude was passing by, a family had just arrived to begin their own holiday parking on the opposite side of where I was getting sorted, and while some dude was packing his family in the car to leave for the evening opposite to where we‚Äôd parked. (I hid as best I could at this moment). 

I managed to avoid public embarrassment - just - but my 10yo daughter now knows full well that dad royally shat himself in public. Safe to say 2020 has been a bit shit but I sure as hell finished it covered in it. Happy NY folks!

TL;DR: crapped myself in public in front of my kids. My daughter knew exactly what was going on and I barely avoided being caught in my recovery efforts.",72,18,tifu

Not only did it come in my eye but also all over the floor and my arms so my left eye closed with nut all over the outside I couldn't see with that I and I didn't have any clothing on so I went to get paper to take it up but it was hard.

I bet if someone watched it in third person it would look retarted, i found paper and cleaned my eye with it then showered it with water. It hurts like a motherfucker and it keeps blinking, I mean is it normal to accidentally cum inside your own eye, no it's not.



My eye looks like a demon eye or some shit like that.

Serves me right for being trusting and Naive. Anyway the story does have a happy ending so read till the end. 

Obligatory this happened between today and yesterday. 

I was trying to find someone to gameshare AC Valhalla, so I could try it and see if I wanted to buy it while it‚Äôs on sale.  

I see this guy talking about how he wants offers for AC Valhalla, so I Hit him how with my stacked account. He tells me to give him my details so I do expecting him to give me his aswell, once he signed in and I gave him my two face Authenticator code, he then gives me an email address and password which actually worked.

This is where so really fucked up, I get another code, which he asks for, saying ‚ÄúI tried to download a game and it asked for it‚Äù, me being stupid actually gave him the code. Not knowing that 2FA is also used when you change the username and password of an account. 

You may see where this is going, I log into his account and it asks for his 2FA, when I tell him he says to ‚Äúhold on a minute‚Äù. Then suddenly I get 2 notifications saying that my 2FA was disabled and my sign in ID changed, and he blocked me on discord.

I start freaking out, I create a new Discord account and message the guy, asking him what the fuck happened, he says that he would give me back the account when my games were done transferring, I know he‚Äôs bullshitting, so I try Sony‚Äôs live chat and it opens in another 3 hours where I live. That was the slowest 3 hours of my life, waiting for it to open. 

While I‚Äôm waiting I get messages from this guy asking if I can buy him anything, like a PSN card or anything else, obviously I said no.

Here‚Äôs another issue, anyone whose ever used the PSN live chat know it‚Äôs the slowest most buggy thing You‚Äôve ever used. Worst experience ever, eventually after an hour they tell me I have to call them to sort this out, due to some legal stuff I have to tell them that I was hacked so they don‚Äôt ban my account. 

Eventually I had sorted everything out and Sony was attempting to get my account back, feeling like the world biggest idiot I go to bed. When I wake up I see messages from the guy saying that my account is gone and that he‚Äôs sold it. Saying; ‚Äústop your crying, I‚Äôve scammed you and made a quick buck, you won‚Äôt get your account back, but here‚Äôs the guy I sold ur account to‚Äù 

So I contact the account he gave me and ask him to give my account back, he says he can‚Äôt because he bought it for $120. Exactly when he sends it, I get an email from PlayStation asking me to reset my password and change my sign in ID,

They did it, those crazy SOB‚Äôs finally did it, my account was mine again. I tell this guy that he‚Äôs the world biggest douche and an ass and then block him. 

So all‚Äôs well that ends well IG, but I‚Äôve learnt my lesson, I‚Äôm never ever gamesharing with anyone again.

When I go there, there were 6 other people there and the basement reeked of pot. I hung out for a bit when I eventually saw a gigantic glass bong on the table and asked if I could partake. Again, I‚Äôve never smoked pot in my life, but I thought it‚Äôd be a good idea to take three huge tips from this gigantic bong. 

I instantly felt inoculated. I got tunnel vision, I started laughing hysterically, and I eventually let it be known that that was my first sampling of pot. This was also a bad idea, as they all started messing with me in various ways. It wasn‚Äôt really mean-spirited, but it wasn‚Äôt cool (but whatever). I eventually decided that I NEEDED leave so without saying anything, I left the house and headed towards my car. 

Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt remember where I had parked it, even though I had just parked it 30 minutes ago. So, I start trekking through the neighborhood looking for my car. At this point, it felt like my brain was melting, and I realized I really needed to get home. Everything looked blurry and fucked up. I eventually flagged down a passing car and asked, ‚Äúexcuse me sir, do you know where my car is?‚Äù (Oh god) He gave me a look and drove away. 

I eventually returned to the classmate‚Äôs house and told them of my predicament which they of course found hilarious. They told me they were going to McDonald‚Äôs and that I unfortunately needed to leave.

t3_knfctd,TIFU by giving my neighbor eggs,"This happened 24 hours ago, but I wanted to wait just in case something changed. Obligatory ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on mobile‚Äù disclaimer. 

I was home alone watching Hulu and eating a square of Dove chocolate, when my neighbor knocked on my door to ask for some eggs. A little weird, but whatever. When I opened the door, my puppy tried to run out! He‚Äôs a 4 month old Yorkipoo who just finished getting his shots on Sunday, but the vet told us he‚Äôs not allowed to go for walks until next week. We live in an apartment complex with a lot of dogs, so I panicked because I didn‚Äôt want him to get Parvo.   This is our first dog, so I‚Äôm extra paranoid. I scooped him up and put him on the couch before I went to the fridge. 

I grab the eggs and focus on not dropping them (I‚Äôm a bit of a klutz) and take them to my neighbor. She thanks me and heads back to her unit.

I turn around, excited to get back to my show, and I hear the puppy licking something. I thought, ‚Äúwhat the hell did he find now?‚Äù Well, I left a piece of chocolate on the side table that he was able to reach from the couch. Yup. He had a square of Dove brand milk chocolate fully wrapped in foil in his tiny little mouth. My heart dropped. I quickly pulled the wrapper out of his mouth and called my parents, who were minutes from home. I‚Äôm a wreck. I grab the puppy and run outside and wait for them to pull up. I couldn‚Äôt breathe. Had a full blown panic attack. Tears and snot everywhere. The puppy is in the backseat crying and confused. My mom is yelling at me to find the directions to the emergency vet, but my hands don‚Äôt work and I can‚Äôt think straight. I manage to do it and we‚Äôre on our way. It was supposed to be a 13 minute drive, but it was in this weird industrial area that neither of us are familiar with. We missed our exit on the freeway and the GPS keeps taking us in circles. By this time, 45 minutes had passed. All I could think is, ‚ÄúOh god, I killed my puppy.‚Äù 

My mom gives up after searching for an extra 10 minutes, and shouts that we are going home. NO. I get it together and call the Vet‚Äôs number to ask them their cross streets. They tell me to get on the phone with Poison Control until we get to the vet. Five minutes later, we‚Äôre there and its *packed*. The puppy is fine, being his happy little self, no sign of any reaction to be found. We wait, and we wait, and we wait. It was taking so long, I was ready to pay $700 so they could take care of it immediately. They finally took him in. I was in queue to talk to PC for about 30 minutes, they finally pick up, and I tell them what happened. 

Turns out, it takes SIX Dove Milk Chocolate Squares to have an affect on the dog. They said I had nothing to worry about. You have to pay for the call, so that was $75. The vet later came out and told us the same thing, and asked if I still wanted them to induce vomiting (which would‚Äôve been over $100). My mom says it‚Äôs okay, so we take him home and monitor his behavior. 

Nothing happened. He was fine and happy and having fun once we were home. The only thing we noticed is a little extra yellow tinge in his pee. He‚Äôs right here napping next to me, and I‚Äôm appreciating him extra. It was one of the worst panic attacks I‚Äôve ever had. Had a massive headache from crying until I finally fell asleep. But we‚Äôre all here, happy and healthy!

But man, that was one expensive piece of chocolate. 

TL;DR  Puppy got into some chocolate while I was getting some eggs for my neighbor. Had a massive panic attack, took forever to get to the vet, but he didn‚Äôt need any treatment. Everyone is fine now.

t3_knem4x,TIFU by putting pyjamas on my kid,"So I‚Äôve got five kids, 17, 13, 10, 7 and 4 months. Pretty big gap between the last 2 because we were done, until we weren‚Äôt. So I‚Äôve forgotten a lot of stuff in 7 years and feel a bit like I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing.

When I was shopping for pyjamas for Christmas I saw some cute ones for my baby. I‚Äôve never put pyjamas on a baby before, it‚Äôs always been a vest and a babygro (bodysuit and sleepsuit, or singlet and onesie, for the non-UK crowd). But they were cute, and I didn‚Äôt see a reason not to buy them. So into my basket they went.

Anyway tonight I popped them on her for the first time. No vest because she was a little warm, and off to bed we go (we bedshare). I‚Äôm boobing her to sleep as usual and it‚Äôs taking a while, maybe there‚Äôs something wrong? Then... kaboom. Poosplosion. And because she has on pyjamas, it‚Äôs all over my bed. All over the floor, the wall... my room is covered in yellow liquid. And now I know why you do NOT put pyjamas on a baby.

TL;DR I put pyjamas on my baby and they did not dam a tidal wave of shite.",43,15,tifu
t3_knekz5,TIFU by sending my D&amp;D group a steamy shower video.,"Quick background. My wife and I were having a light-hearted argument about the best way to clean feet. I told her that I like to put a bit of body soap on the shower floor and then quickly move my feet back and forth over the soap until clean. She thought that was incredibly stupid.   


So fast forward to today, I'm taking my shower and get the *brilliant* idea to take a video of my method, because obviously she just didn't understand. I grab my phone and try to balance it and the soap bottle. Then I proceed to my method. I was trying to keep the video tasteful,  but wasn't super worried, seeing as the recipient was my wife, so there was some floppy in the video for a brief second.  I finish cleaning my feet and go to send the video through messenger.   


And yeah, I did the thing I never thought I would do, I sent it to the D&amp;D group chat.  I panicked and tried to undo but the phone had some significant moisture on it, as well as my fingers so didn't quite make it. I jumped out of the shower and dried my hands and phone like a maniac. With dry fingers and phone, I unlocked and went into messenger, then to the group chat just in time to see the little dots drop. The Dragonborn Rouge, the Half-Elf Ranger, and the Human Fighter all saw it. We were sending memes back and forth before the shower, so I guess they were still active. I quickly unsent and took a moment to figure out my response.  


The first message from the Ranger. ""WTF???"" I just started sending out apologies like crazy. It's surprisingly hard to explain why you were making a foot cleaning video in the first place. I guess I just figured that if I keep trying to explain and apologize in short bursts, the avalanche of pathetic groveling and embarrassing explanations would keep things at bay.   


Luckily I play with some great people who know me fairly well so everyone got a good laugh. But I doubt we'll get much gaming done next session. No way I'm going to live this down anytime soon.  


TLDR; I took a video of how I like to wash my feet in the shower after my wife said it was weird and accidentally sent a brief flash of wang to my D&amp;D group.

Edited: Just to say thank you for all the feedback and awards. And to update. I got a bit of lack but everyone thought the whole thing was pretty funny. No harm sans my ego.",374,43,tifu

So I‚Äôm kind of a nerd. I like words, math, all that good stuff. I like little facts about etymology, or the study and history of words. I find it fascinating. 

I was scrolling through reddit and came across someone posting something about their subreddit about the study of words. I lowkey got excited and clicked away. 

The description was the exact definition of etymology. I clicked on a post that was along the lines of ‚Äúcould someone identify...pennsylvania...‚Äù I skimmed the title. I figured it was Some kind of old word they needed help with. I don‚Äôt know.

I clicked and got a face full of a giant beetle/spider-looking insect. 

Turns out I clicked on a sub called ‚Äúentymology,‚Äù not ‚Äúetymology.‚Äù I got the words confused since they‚Äôre so similar, but the description was of ‚Äúetymology,‚Äù so I didn‚Äôt think about the study of insects. 

The reason it‚Äôs a fuck up and I‚Äôm still creeped out is because I have a giant, intense phobia of insects. Spiders, mainly, but all bugs are creepy. I started freaking out and got nauseous, so yeah that was super fun.

t3_kndllv,TIFU by breathing COVID fumes,"I'm a doctor working in the ER and there are a lot of COVID patients every day. I know the routine of putting on all the protective gear, the masks, the treatment- this wasn't my first rodeo with COVID.

&amp;#x200B;

The patient is older, and is currently hypoxic (not getting enough oxygen), and I am suspecting a super infection with bacterial pneumonia on top. At first the patient is on 3 liters of O2, but the nurse calls me in because she can't get an arterial blood sample and it needs to be done with ultrasound to find the artery. Get into all the gear, go in with scanner, get the sample, evaluate the person, increase oxygen, get out and confer with my attending, get all the COVID regiment going.

&amp;#x200B;

The patient desaturates again- oxygen saturation needs to be above 95% in people with no lung diseases- above 92% can be acceptable in COVID cases. The patient is at 84%. On goes the gear, new arterial blood sample, increase oxygen, stabilize the patient.

&amp;#x200B;

Rinse and repeat until I've been into the room six times to stabilize the patient, who is quickly getting worse. I know the protective gear, it's like a reflex to put it all on correctly by now.

&amp;#x200B;

But the patient is still getting worse, so I put them on high flow oxygen treatment, 35 liters of flow and 35% oxygen levels. I talk to the ICU, because this patient is rapidly deteriorating and there is ONE spot free so I nab that like a greedy little gremlin.

&amp;#x200B;

Just before the patient is getting transferred, the O2 levels drops again to 68% and the nurse calls me in a panic to tell me that the patient is crashing. I rush into the protective gear, get in there and crank the high flow to the max. Eventually I manage to stabilize the patient enough for transport and they go to the ICU- an hour later they're on a respirator.

&amp;#x200B;

Yay me, right? The next day however, my attending pulls me over and asks me what sort of mask I was wearing when I went into the patients room on that 7th time and my heart just fucking plummets. I stutter out ""I was wearing the wrong mask.""

&amp;#x200B;

On a high flow air treatment, you have to wear an FFP3 mask. I only wore a regular surgical mask because that was the only mask at the gear station.

&amp;#x200B;

I think back on how I leaned over the patient to get the arterial blood sample with the ultrasound scanner. I remember how I held the patients hand, telling the patient we were doing everything we could and we were going to transfer to ICU. I remember the patient coughing, me standing right next to the bed, just breathing in the COVID fumes.

&amp;#x200B;

All the times I've seen COVID patients, all the times I've put on the correct gear and this one time I managed to screw up. Currently at home in isolation, waiting for the COVID tests, while all my colleagues are working their butts off at the ER.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I am a dumb doctor at work, forgot to wear the right protective gear and got coughed in the face by a COVID patient. COVID sucks, wear your masks.

EDIT1:

Also worth noting, and because I've gotten a few messages about it- the standard PPE for covid or suspected covid cases is different from place to place, as are the procedures. Where I work the standard gear is a face shield, a surgical mask, gloves and a coat, which is only to be worn once.

If there is a risk of aerosols, such as high flow air treatment or cardiac arrest treatment, we are allowed to wear FFP2/FFP3 (N95 and N99) but they are also only for one time use. These sorts of masks will not be at the PPE stations unless there is a need for it.

EDIT2: Thank you all for your kind words and well-wishes! You are all wonderful people who make me feel a little better about the situation. I am waiting to get tested on the 4th and 7th day of exposure and hopefully they will come back negative so I can get back in the field. And then I will NEVER forget to put on the right gear again!

And to all my fellow healthcare workers; stay safe out there!

&amp;#x200B;

Last edit here: I tested negative on my 4th and 7th day after exposure, so I am in the clear! And I waited an hour in line today to get my covid shot. Patient is still on a respirator, but is on the way to recovery and hopefully will pull through.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks again for all your well wishes and wonderful words.

t3_kndk6v,TIFU by getting a condom stuck in my ex girlfriends ass,"So, this happened maybe 20 or so years ago. Met this girl at work and we hit it off. Always all flirty around each other and after a little while, she invited me to her place. I went over and we started drinking and watching TV. Started fooling around and made our way to the bedroom. I was pretty plastered but at one point I asked her if she took it in the ass. I'd never banged anybody in the ass before but figured what the hell. So, I put a condom on and she proceeded to straddle me while I was laying down. I don't remember anything after that really. Apparently during, I passed the fuck out and my hard on went away. When she got off of me, because I didn't have a boner anymore the condom slid off when my johnson slid out and left the condom in her ass. Apparently she had to dig around for it and pull it out. She told me the next morning. So yeah, that was embarrassing. We were together for about 3 or 4 years afterwards.  
TL:DR: Went to chicks house. Got plastered drunk. Started banging her in the ass and I passed out, thus leaving the condom in her ass to fish out.",208,33,tifu
t3_knddxo,TIFU by ordering two dildos,"I‚Äôm a bi guy, and a while ago I started buying sex toys off Amazon (the most trustworthy source of sex toys...) and it started out alright actually, I started with three buttplugs which have been a great success. Then, I tried to order a dildo. Maybe it was just bad timing (Christmas + COVID in the UK is shite) but it didn‚Äôt arrive three weeks after it was supposed to. So I cancelled it, and got a refund, and proceeded to order another one, which actually did arrive. So I started using it and it was fine and I can‚Äôt remember what brought me onto it but I started looking at information about dildo‚Äôs on the internet. I learned that dildos made of PVC (polyvinylchloride) are not great sex toy materials because they‚Äôre porous, so you get bacterial and fungal growth inside the material. So I checked the packaging and it turns out the one I had bought was indeed made of PVC. 

I wasn‚Äôt worried about the infections or any of that because I‚Äôd only used it for a short period of time, but I realised I‚Äôd need to get a silicone one if I wanted to use it properly (I can use the PVC one, but I have to put a condom on it, and I don‚Äôt want to use all my condoms on that) so I went back to amazon and ordered a silicone one, which also arrived successfully. I was using the new one and was once again researching dildo material reviews and suddenly read an article that said you should avoid ordering off Amazon because many sellers make counterfeit silicone toys to make money (because there isn‚Äôt a legal requirement for sex toys to say what it‚Äôs made of according to my research). 

So I stopped using that one as well, but because it‚Äôs different to the PVC one, I‚Äôm not convinced it isn‚Äôt silicone, but I‚Äôm lowkey too scared to keep using it to find out. Time to get out the condoms I guess.

TL;DR I didn‚Äôt do research before investing in sex toys and subsequently wasted around ¬£35 on them.",12,10,tifu

t3_knb4k8,TIFU by slamming my door,"Ok well this happened in April, 2019, but I figured it belonged here. 

We moved into a new house in 2018. The old owners left a thick mirror on my door. One of the ones that don‚Äôt have a frame and don‚Äôt shatter, but instead breaks into large pieces. That information is relevant to the story.

So the night this happened, my grandmother and I had gotten into an argument. I had gotten pretty mad and stormed up to my room to calm down. I slammed my door very hard for a 5‚Äô2 teenage girl. I heard a crash and time slowed down. I saw the mirror break into countless pieces, including a few huge chunks of thick glass. One of those chunks of glass sliced through my left shin. I didn‚Äôt even feel it at first. I looked down and saw blood. All I saw was blood. 

I screamed and managed to run down the stairs with a hole in my leg (thank you, adrenaline). My brother and my grandmother both helped hold pressure on the wound while we waited for an ambulance to arrive. I didn‚Äôt feel any pain at all (again, thank you, adrenaline) and was just freaking out. 

The glass just barely missed my muscle, but cut the layer right above the muscle. Because of that, and my stupid fear of popping a stitch, I lost half my movement in my left ankle. My nerves are severely damaged. Every light touch anywhere near or below the scar (oh yea, I got 48 stitches btw) sends tingles shooting up my leg. Kind of feels like pins and needles, but it‚Äôs just in a line above wherever my leg got touched. You know when a limb gets tired? Yea, my leg does that randomly. And it sucks. I used to have great balance, but my balance has been completely thrown off by this. 

Do I regret slamming that door? Not really. Left me with a great story and a scar that caught my now boyfriend‚Äôs attention over a year ago. I just hate that I now get extremely nervous around broken glass now.

At 8:30AM I geared up in heavy boots, snowpants, a winter coat, two pairs of gloves and a hat. We just had a snowstorm overnight and I was heading outside to get the shoveling and snowblowing done around the yard and driveway.  I wanted to get it done early so I could come back in and relax, sitting down to a more substantial meal than the protein shake I downed before going out. After finishing the job, i lock the Snowblower back into the shed and head inside-... or not!  

The door is locked. I locked it out of habit as I walked out to clear the snow. Being so early, and trying to accomplish the task asap, i didn‚Äôt have my car/house keys, wallet, cell phone, or anything on my person. It was about 5 degrees and I was locked out with no way to contact anyone.

In the end it wasnt a terrible day. I walked a mile or so to a friends house, who let me in to warm up and drink water. On the way I found a stranger who let me use their phone to notify my housemate who was at work what happened. 6 hours later I was picked up at the friend‚Äôs place by someone giving my housemate a ride home from work. 

I was fortunate to have been prepared for the weather, but I won‚Äôt lie there was a moment of panic when I realized I might be stuck in the cold for many hours. Keeping myself warm by moving toward a close friends house, even gambling they may not be home, was my first thought. I imagine this would have been a very different day if the snow were still blowing, or I had half assed my gear for clearing the driveway.

t3_knaw7t,TIFU -- By Falling Asleep,"Obligatory: This was actually several years ago.

It was my first morning after my first night at a graveyard shift job, and I was beat. The hubs was at work, the teen was at school, and the munchkin was at daycare.  I was home alone. I was also hungry, but too tired to actually cook something. We had no microwave at the time, and there were no left-overs. So my lazy and tired ass grabbed a package of hotdogs from the freezer, filled a pot of water, and tossed them in, package and all. Then I sat down on the sofa to wait for them to cook.

Big mistake.

I fell asleep, and when I woke up, the house was filled with smoke. I yanked the boiled-dry pot off the stove, and saw my hotdogs were ruined.  I mean, even the plastic wrap was melted to the pot (damn, my favorite one, too!).  I hacked and wheezed my way to the hall, and opened up the attic fan to clear out all the smoke.

Not a moment later, there came an urgent banging on my door, and I answered it.

It was the cable guy, who was on a ladder at the house, replacing the cable with fiber optics (they were upgrading the whole neighborhood, and we'd gotten the notice, but I completely forgot), and he'd seen all the smoke roll out of the attic. He thought the house was on fire, and it scared the crap out of him. He blurted, ""Are you okay?!""

""Yeah, just a bonehead.""

I stuck with sandwiches from that point on for a few weeks, until I was used to working graveyard.

Poor cable guy.

Was helping my cousin, who‚Äôll we‚Äôll call Adam. Adam owns his own small construction/renovation company, pretty much just him and two other guys right now. Very early stages of their company, and Adam is the only one of the three who can actually do manual labor, the other two are project managers/money handling guys.

So Adam hit me up on Monday, because he needed a set of [French Doors and their jam (the frame)](https://d38wdttsj0wp9z.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/French-Door.jpg) lifted up onto the deck of a small house he‚Äôs been working on (far too small of a house to carry them inside.)

I agree, and this morning we pick up the brand new set and drive up into the Rockies, about 2 hours. We get to the house and take apart the doors and frame, and lift one by one onto the (VERY SNOWY) deck. We shovel off the snow and he goes down to get his tools to install the frame, I wait on the deck.

The frame to the doors is slightly in front of the opening in the house, set off to the side. I think I hear Adam coming and step forward to ask if he needs help. And this is where everything becomes garbage. I take a step forward and step on the only patch of slippery, somewhat icy snow left on the deck, because I didn‚Äôt bother to check. My left foot flies out behind me, my right knee slams into the deck, and my shoulder slams into the jam, which is no longer weighed down by the doors inside it. The jam flies forward and before I can grab it, it slips off the deck and into the ground. 

Where once sat untouched snow now sits 4 pieces that used to be one. Adam hears the commotion and comes by, and god bless his soul the man is as gracious as can be. He doesn‚Äôt yell or anything, he just contemplates what to do next. The jam is far too damaged to just put back together, it has been cracked significantly on two of the pieces. We patch up the hole, and drive back down to Denver in complete silence.

As I write this Adam already told me it‚Äôs fine, accidents happen (though that won‚Äôt stop me from paying him back, when I can.) I‚Äôm icing my knee now, and I feel like a dumbass.

t3_kn8lbw,TIFU - Getting into what I thought was a Taxi at the DFW Airport,"Hello, long time listener first-time caller. This was last summer while working in software sales. My company would regularly send me to Mississippi from Oklahoma to meet with clients. The trip was always a nightmare, because of the layover in DFW (Dallas, TX). My flight would constantly get delayed or more oftentimes, canceled. This was one of those times. 

On my way back to Oklahoma, during my layover in DFW, my flight was canceled. This means I wait in a long af line to get my hotel/food certificate so I can stay and wait till the next flight in the morning. This took about 2 hours. At 10 pm I got my hotel certificate, gathered my things, and went outside to hail an Uber. This particular time the wait for an Uber was around 30 Mins, which was incredibly odd... So I started looking for a Taxi. I saw a yellow Prius pull up to drop someone off. The rider got out of the backseat, and the driver got out and grabbed their luggage out of the trunk. This was the perfect chance to snag this taxi and get some shut-eye. This is where I fucked up. 

I went over to the driver, asked him if he could take me to the Embassy Suites. He agreed. I got into the car, and we were off. I was so distracted and tired, texting my girlfriend and mom to let them know I was in a taxi and on my way to the hotel in Dallas, that I didn't look up from my phone for a good 5 minutes. 

I then noticed the telltale signs of a taxi were not in this man's vehicle. There wasn't a meter or his identification. I immediately realized I got into a strangers car... Fucking scared out of my gourd, I asked him if he was a Taxi driver or Uber. Which he laughed and replied, ""No, I just moved here from Africa..."" He had a thick accent, and could barely speak English. He then got on his phone and made a call to a ""friend"" in his native language... This is when I got really scared and texted my girlfriend ""I am in a strangers car, in Dallas""... She flipped out and called me, but I didn't answer... I was too busy trying to navigate to the hotel to make sure we were going in the right direction... Which we were not. We were definitely heading in the OPPOSITE  (south) direction of the hotel. 

The driver, still on his phone, pulled the phone away from his face and then asked me how much money I had to pay for the ride. I safely replied, ""I have Zero Cash, so let's stop at an ATM at the nearest gas station so I can pull some out..."" He put the phone back up to his face, spoke to his ""friend"", and THEN reluctantly agreed, (meanwhile, we are getting farther and farther away from the hotel). We stopped at a gas station, I got out, went inside, and immediately went to the restroom, and hailed another Uber to take me to the hotel... I sat in that gas station bathroom for 30 minutes to wait for an Uber. As I came out, he was still waiting for me... I hopped in the Uber and told them what happened. Apparently, this was a pretty common occurrence at the DFW airport. 

\*I want to add that his accent or country of origin had nothing to do with my freak out, it was the fact that we were driving in the wrong direction to the hotel and his mannerisms towards the money I didn't have.

t3_kn6y8m,TIFU by walking into the wrong house during an install.,"To preface this, I work for Geek Squad as a home theater installer. We were doing a pre-wire for a surround sound and I went to grab the tools and everything from our van. The only place to park was between two houses in a sort of narrow cul-de-sac and both houses had a nearly identical architecture.

After grabbing all of the tools, I walk back to the home that I thought I had just left. So without knocking, I walk right through the front door that was unlocked and start walking down the stairs to their basement when I realize that none of this looks familiar anymore and It begins to dawn on me that this is not the same house. 

Suddenly, I hear a scream and turn to look and an elderly woman in her 60s is staring at me, completely terrified. The weather is in the 30s so I was wearing a jacket over my geek squad uniform, so all this poor woman saw was a man wearing a heavy jacket and mask, carrying a ladder and hammer, and walking up from her basement. I am obviously at a loss for words as I have never done anything this stupid before. 

Luckily, she gave me a chance to explain myself, so I regained my composure and told her what had happened and we shared a good laugh about it before I sheepishly left and went back to the right house. 

TL;DR I left one house to grab tools during an install and walked into the wrong house, terrifying the home owner. After explaining, we shared a good laugh and nothing bad happened.",637,50,tifu
t3_kn6wty,TIFU by using a makeup brush as a buttplug,"I regret everything I ever thought was a good idea, and the only way of making myself feel better about this situation is by posting. I am NOT a buttplay type of girl. I‚Äôve always found it uncomfortable personally, but my partner has some sort of obsession with the poopoo hole, so that‚Äôs the preface.

That night, I had a little too much to drink. Me and my boyfriend were watching a movie and things started to get a little frisky, as they do. It started out as just a normal session, until my boyfriend brought up the idea of ‚Äúworking up the dildo train‚Äù to stretch my bumhole into shape so he could then defile me in the way which he desired. My drunk ass though, ‚ÄúOkay! Bet!‚Äù (because drunk me has no common sense) and I produced a fairly small makeup brush. We lubed it up, I bent over, and he pushed it in slowly. And he pushed it in DEEP (to the point where the bristles were barely sticking out of my bumhole like tiny hairs). I was just laughing so hard and found it amusing and strangely erotic in the moment, and it was a great bonding time for us...

That is, until the removal process: We tried to pull the bristles on the end, but they were not strong enough to combat the tightness of my poor bootyhole. At this point I began to freak a little bit, not even wanting him to touch down there. I tried pulling it out myself, but it was stuck. Very stuck. My butthole was like a suction cup for the makeup brush and any time i tried to bend over I could feel it pushing inside my butthole and it hurt. I sat on the toilet for almost an hour just pushing in the hopes that I could pass it, but to no avail. My butthole was literally eating the brush.

Pan to 45 minutes later, I‚Äôm crying in the waiting room of the ER, half sitting, half laying down, waiting for a doctor to get in there and pull it out. Which she did, and I went on my merry way about an hour after that. But not without a lesson learned.

It was and always will be the most embarrassing, uncomfortable, weird experience of my life. I have decided to remain abstinent from anything and everything involving ass play, from this moment until the end of my existence on this planet AND the next.

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I put a makeup brush up my booty and neither of us could pull it out, so I had to get it removed in the ER

EDIT: I did not expect to get so many upvotes on this story, but thank you for all the awards and hilarious comments. Also wanted to mention that everything that happened that night was consensual.

We kissed in the hotel room, but she said that she wouldn't stay as she would be having dinner with her relatives.

Two weeks after my purchase, I received the shirts and they came with some cute little gifts from the store, a hair accessory, some stickers and those little Christmas biscuits that were just lovely, and I love sweets so I was so excited that they sent them to me! 

After lunch I really wanted to eat something sweet but I didn't have anything sweet at home, only the biscuits I got from the store. I opened the package, I smelled them and I thought ""well, that's weird, those biscuits smell like soap"" I was a bit suspicious, but decided to bite them anyway, just a small bite, and then I thought ""okay, those sweets also taste like soap... Maybe they actually are soap"", but I was craving for sweets so much that I wasn't fully convinced yet, I went to my mother and I was like ""mum, do you think those are sweets or soap"" and she confirmed to me they were soap, I hadn't swallow that little piece of soap that I had bitten, so I spit it out instantly and started washing my mouth. 

Since that day my parents are making fun of me whenever we see a soap, they are kindly reminding me I shouldn't eat those things.

I had to work this morning but my brother and his friend kept playing so they stayed on that channel. 

I have a few medical issues and every day I have to do an enema in order to get the poop out of me and my stomach was bothering me so I figured I would do one before bed. I took my phone with me in the bathroom so I could browse Reddit while pooping because it‚Äôs boring sitting on the toilet for 10 minutes without it. 

I started doing my enema and proceeded to explosively shit for 5 minutes when I hear a faint voice coming from my phone.

Obligatory statement: this did not happen today but rather it happened 3 or so years ago

I  was traveling overseas a few years ago and was in Abu Dhabi with some  coworkers who wanted to go into the city to swim in the Gulf and go out  to a restaurant afterwards. Looking back, it was Prego's Restaurant if  anyone is familiar.  Anyway, after spending some time in the water, we  went to shower off and change our clothes in order to get ready for the  restaurant afterwards. There was a decently long line for the showers so  I was prepared to wait in line for my turn at the shower. A couple of  guys went off to the side and were showering with these sprayers that  were attached to the hoses. Before anyone asks, it wasn't out in the  open but they were in the stalls and I could see what was going on  through the gap at the bottom. Eventually, one of the guys in the  bathroom gestured for me to use the bathroom and with it, the spray  nozzle hooked up to the side of the toilet. As an American, I haven't  ever used a bidet, but I can piece together enough to know that the  spray nozzle next to a toilet probably isn't for showering but as I was  in a foreign country and was feeling the time crunch as my anxiety sure  wouldn't let me forget that others were waiting on me, I decided to  shower myself off. So I stripped and showered the best that I could with  a hose that wasn't very long utilizing my best yoga poses and  contortionist impressions. Once I had washed to my content, I left the  stalls and went to meet up with my coworkers. Needless to say, I didn't  talk about this experience with my friends/coworkers as I didn't want to  be known as the guy who showered with a bidet.

TL;DR: I went swimming and due to a long line for the showers, ended up showering with a bidet.",13,3,tifu

I was picking up my boyfriend at the time from his job as a line cook. We both had a drink when I got there so we needed to hang out for an hour before heading home in order to be legal. In order to pass the time, he pulled out an mp3 player and was showing me some songs from a bunch of his favourite online creators. 

They were really varying in quality--some were really good and others were just ok--but there was one that bugged me. I didn't listen to the lyrics very well because I was trying to figure out why it sounded so familiar. I knew I had never heard any of these before, and yet I could almost have sung along. 

All at once I recognized the baseline.  The artist had replaced all the lyrics, and the instruments were different, but it was unmistakable. It was #1 Crush. A little startled by the realization, I pulled the headphones off and declared ""This is Garbage!""

I have never seen such a wounded expression. 

He's younger than me and did not know about the band.  If we were not both still stuck there waiting to sober up that might have been our last date.  As it was I did get a chance to explain myself. He must have forgiven me because now he doesn't even remember the story. And now we're married.

t3_kn0gg1,TIFU by telling my parents I was rejected from my dream school,"I‚Äôm a high school senior (I am 18 though so if you see my Secret Santa posts no I didn‚Äôt lie about my age ;)) My family has always been very poor and I am the youngest of three kids. When my sister went to college, she went to one of the top schools in the country on a huge scholarship but her degree still left my family struggling financially.

I didn‚Äôt want to be like my sister. I started working when I was 16 and balanced two jobs with lots of extracurriculars and school. I worked my ass off day and night to save as much money as possible so my parents didn‚Äôt have to worry about me.

Now, I applied to three colleges on a fee waiver my school gave me. Early decision has come out for them and... I got in to all three. One of these is my absolute dream school, the same top college my sister went to. The other two are less competitive schools that I mostly applied to as a safety net in case my dream didn‚Äôt work out. One of my safety schools gave me almost a full ride worth of scholarship money.

I sat and debated this for a couple weeks. Should I pursue my dream and pay thousands of dollars that I‚Äôve spent years saving up? Or should I take the money they‚Äôve offered me at the safety school and go somewhere I‚Äôm not passionate about? I was also worried about what my parents would think. If they knew I got accepted to that school, they would never let me make a sacrifice like that. I know they‚Äôd take on any financial burden to let me attend.

So... I kinda did a thing. I told them I was rejected from my absolute top college, let them cry to me about how sorry they were, and then told them I got a really good scholarship to the other school.

They‚Äôre really excited for me. They can‚Äôt stop bragging to their friends how smart I have to be to get a good amount of money, but I can‚Äôt shake this feeling of dread and ‚ÄúI fucked up‚Äù-ness. I haven‚Äôt made my decision yet to the actual colleges so I can still change my mind but... something in me knows I‚Äôll stick with my original plan.

I guess I‚Äôm mostly posting this to get it off my chest somewhere. I hope anyone who reads this far is having a blessed holiday season and a happy new year! Thank you for listening.

TL;DR I told my parents I was rejected from my top choice school (when I was really accepted) so they wouldn‚Äôt worry about the financial burden of me attending.

EDIT: Thank you all for the kind replies and advice! It‚Äôs appreciated more than I can express. To give some info, I plan on studying Engineering. The Big school in question is top in my state for STEM based subjects and does have good connections and resources for people studying this field. In addition, I‚Äôm in love with the area it‚Äôs in and can picture a home there better than any college I‚Äôve been to. However, the safety school isn‚Äôt a bad school. It‚Äôs a nice education and the area is safe. I‚Äôm not unhappy with the idea of going there, it‚Äôs just not my top choice!

EDIT 2: Some people in the comments have referred to me as ‚Äúman‚Äù and ‚Äúbro‚Äù which is totally fine! But I wanted to maybe add to my story that I‚Äôm a teenage girl lol. The big scholarship I earned was for a women in STEM program. Exciting stuff!",1500,238,tifu

Cue showtime after she went in to clean herself , came out, and got into doggy and presented herself. I didn‚Äôt really know what to do, so I very gently gave the flower a gentle flick of the tongue.

Wrong move. People that are ticklish can perform remarkable feats when under tickle threat. 

In hindsight, a firm and assertive opening move could have changed the course of history.

I got a fart blast directly onto my tongue and a horse kick onto my balls at a very serious velocity then another onto my stomach as I just began to double over in pain as she scrambled desperately away from the source, hitting her head on the bedpost. 

I slowly recovered from my pain to see her almost in tears, mortified at the outcome of events. I smiled through the pain, and as I came to my senses, I began to realise to my horror (?), that the fart excited me.

I eventually figured out how to climb out, I was near the bottom of the hill. My face, and hands were scratched up, my right arm was broken, and I had a concussion. I walked up the hill taking breaks when I got dizzy. I walked inside my house and sat at the table for a bit.

I am proud to say that in my time when I first hopped behind the wheel till now I never made a major noob beginner driver mistake. That is, until yesterday. When coming out of walmart, I was turning left. Before I turn I always subconsciously think ‚ÄúOkay, you‚Äôre turning. Which way and how will you turn?‚Äù I was coming in to the left side of the road and I was making a left turn. Meaning I have to pass the incoming left lane to get into the right. But, for some odd reason my subconscious thinking treated the left turn as a right turn where in this situation I‚Äôd turn in to the lane closest to me. So I turned into the left lane, I realized this when a car turned into the lane. I knew I fucked up then and there and I was already moving so all I could do now is push forward towards the right lane. But guess my luck, a truck was coming down the right lane. I zoom in so I dont hit that truck. And thankfully that truck had time to stop. It beeped at me. I was so embarrassed. This was my VERY first major noob driving mistake.

I was chilling on a minecrafter's stream, the chat was the same as any day by chanting ""arson pog"" and ""be gay do crime"", y'know the usual.

I was getting bored with it and had extra money to spare, so I donated some bits to say something along the lines of ""I'm going to say it chat, I brush my teeth before drinking oj on purpose."" 

It gained the traction I wanted with the chat being appropriately disgusted. I do like the taste of orange juice after something minty, mainly because the reaction tends to be like this.

Anyway, the disgust begins to die down but I can't have that. I message again ""if you brush your teeth before drinking oj it gives the next sour texture I need. Kind of like the tingling feeling garlic bread has."" Completely normal right?

Wrong! 

People start telling me garlic bread doesn't tingle and I look it up on google and shows garlic allergy. This must be a lie, this can't be true. Garlic bread numbed and itched everyone's mouth, that's what it did.

This had to be an elaborate prank so I ask the stream: ""serious question, garlic bread is supposed to tingle right? It's supposed to feel like eating a pineapple right?"" I had always stuck those two foods together in a group as ""food that fights back""

t3_kmt944,TIFU by putting diesel in my new gas car,"I recently bought my first car, a 2005 car in great shape for only 5000 USD. I had to gas it up for the first time today and nobody had ever really taught me which has to use. Instead of calling my parents or some shit, I guessed and chose diesel. The nozzle didn't even fit in my car, but I thought that was because the car was from 2005, and maybe the nozzle size has changed since then. I realized how fucking expensive it was getting and said, ""Shit, I don't know how full it is, but I'll buy regular next time, that's a lot less expensive!"" (If you're wondering how I didn't realize regular was the right one, it was because diesel actually said what it was, I thought regular was too vague."" So I drive off with 1/4 a tank of gas/petrol, 3/4 a tank of diesel. After a while it starts making a noise like there's something plastic jumping around in the hood. I thought I had probably left the gas tank open and the little plastic cap was flapping around. I stopped at a family member's house and told them what happened. Yep, out of the four choices for fuel I had, I managed to choose the only wrong one. There was an auto shop a block away from my family member's house and they said they couldn't fix it because it had been driven, so we'd have to take it apart and clean every part of the car the fuel had touched. So we went back to my family member's house and called my parents. We decided that I'd fix it myself because it might cost as much as the car to get this fixed. So we called 3 different tow truck companies to take it to my house, but none of them came. So my dad bought a kit for draining the fuel and a manual for the car and we're gonna fix it here in about a week and it will take multiple days to fix and it will never work as well as it did before.

TL;DR: I put the wrong type of fuel in my new car and potentially ruined it.",46,62,tifu

So to get a little context I live in a house with a huge yard that‚Äôs full of insects of every kind. My sister has arachnophobia so I kill all the spiders in the house and yesterday one of the biggest spiders I‚Äôve ever seen passed trough the living room. My sister just can‚Äôt find peace until the spider dies so I had to kill that guy. I kinda hate them for this.


A few hours after this episode I went to the bathroom to pee, but I was in such a hurry that I didn‚Äôt notice that there was a tiny yellow spider in the toilet. The door was open and my sister just got in and started SCREAMING at me and idk why but I JUMPED OUT OF THE TOILET WHILE MY PISS WAS COMING OUT. My mom run to us because she thought someone got hurt and I COULDNT STOP THE PEE so I PEED THE FLOOR in front of them. Lol.



TLDR: my sister screamed at me because of a spider in the toilet while I was peeing, I jumped out of it (or off?), my mum came and I couldn‚Äôt stop the pee. :(",33,15,tifu
t3_kmswul,TIFU by Cleaning my Shower,"So my shower drain has been kinda smelly so I decided baking soda and vinegar down the drain would do the trick. Immediately after finishing with that task I figured, might as well clean the shower walls with some Foaming Bathroom Bleach. So I‚Äôm scrubbing and the whole bathroom starts to smell funny, I try not to breathe while scrubbing but it gets stronger. I scrubbed for like 2 minutes or less then decided to look up if bleach + vinegar is toxic and it turns out that it creates chlorine gas similar to  Ammonia + Bleach marking chloramine vapors. Feeling very stupid and cold because I‚Äôm sitting outside with all the windows open. Don‚Äôt think the ppm were too high because I am not suffering any lasting effects besides fresh air smelling weird.

But it's been a bit of a dry spell lately so I thought hey why not. You know they always have one of those deals where you just enter your card details and get free credits to get a private show with a model? This time, being a grown up, I have my own credit card details to get those credits!

So I started the show with my chosen model, it was going great, but I noticed that the credits weren't running out. Hmm. Maybe time was just going slower than I thought. But I kept my eye on the clock and something was definitely wrong. Nope. My credits were only supposed to buy me 2 minutes of cam time. Something is up. End show! So I checked my credit history. Hmm. I'd spent 625 credits!!! That equals ¬£60($80)! Fuck. How did that happen. I didn't even have that money on the card I used.

So, thank GOD, because I didn't have the money on my card the payment never went through, and the nice lady on live chat took pity on a broke college student by just cancelling it altogether. So I get 10 minutes and 25 seconds of sexy time for free essentially. But damn. No wank is worth that stress.

t3_kmsbd8,TIFU by chatting while masked,"TIFU earlier today running into an older neighbor at the checkout of the local market and having a chat. We haven't seen each other in about a year. She has an elderly husband, Doug, in his nineties, that usually rides in the car with her on errands even if he doesn't go into the store. We're both masked up, the store is too small for more than two customers at a time while socially distancing, so we step outside to talk a bit. I notice her husband isn't in the front seat, but it's a bit below freezing so maybe they didn't want him to be sitting in the cold, and when I last saw her he had been too frail to come inside with her as well. Now my partner of almost three decades died at the end of March so I tell her this. She conveys her condolences. We speak a bit about how weird the year has been. And then she says ""my dog passed in June."" I've never known them to have a dog, but I roll with it and say mine's still going strong, but he still bites people, which maybe living in the middle of nowhere isn't a bad thing. ""No. My Doug died. In June."" Oh. Oops

t3_kmroe4,TIFU: By thinking my weed dealers iguana was fake,"So I live in a landlocked state where weed is still illegal, so we have to go really far to get legal stuff. So today I'm in need and I message my guy who lives a few blocks away. Everythings normal and I get in my car to go to his place.(I've probably been there about 10 times.) Obviously it's December so everything looks a little different on account of the snow. So I pull in and let him know im there but something in my gut says its the wrong house, he texts back and says, ""come in but don't knock my dogs will freak"". So now im pretty shook up because I don't think I'm at the right place and I can't knock right? So I walk up to the door and open it to see a man in his 70s standing in his boxers making a sandwich in the kitchen. Whoops so I apologize explicitly and to my surprise he smiles and says ""your here for (guy) aren't you?"" So im shaken at this point and I say yes with hesitation right as my guy comes out of the bathroom. Thank God right so now everything is going much better and we are chillin for about 20 minutes, at this point I see a really cool statue thing chillin on the table so I lean down to take a better look. Immediately guy says, ""hey man carefully that things an asshole"" and right as he says that i turn my head to look back at the iguana and its full on charging me! My chin is maybe 3 inches off the level of the coffee table and it met my chin with 4 or 5 quick scratches hahah my bad I guess!

t3_kmri8t,TIFU by reading yet-another blatantly fake TIFU post without realising,"Sadly this subreddit has become nothing more than a place to weave tall tales and/or pat yourself on the back by talking about how a supposed 'mistake' you made ended up with you finding the cure to cancer at the bottom of the treasure chest your Nan left you late last year. While some may find it quite the fuck up to never check under all those gold coins in the chest (who knows what could be under them!), I personally feel like OP is just looking to brag that their Nan was addicted to sucking Black Beard's knob when Grandpa wasn't around.

Now normally I know better and rarely read any of the TIFU posts that manage to show up on my feed, but today I succumbed to the bait; I wasted a good 5 minutes or so of my life reading along as the suspense slowly built up to the inevitable-yet-somehow-not-anticipated-by-me climax of 'ISN'T OP THE GREATEST?!'. They didn't even have the manners to blame 2020 for their 'misfortune'. For shame.

Well played TIFU, well played. I'm sure there are still some legitimate TIFU posts being made but they're being drowned out by so much noise that I can no longer be a willing participant. Thank you to those good Samaritans who take the time to fact-check posts to the best of their ability and comment when they find something suspicious, you lot are the real heroes of this subreddit. I hope that your Nan gets the chance to blow a famous pirate so you too can inherit a bunch of gold coins with an even better reward underneath them. Don't forget to avoid checking under them though so the rest of us can hear about how unfortunate it was that you never thought to actually inspect the treasure chest.

My apologies to all readers who expected more from my own post - clearly my creative writing course isn't paying off and I should find another subreddit to practise in before posting here. At least there will undoubtedly be many more Redditors far more capable of spinning enough magical webs of pure, unfiltered truth to keep your spidey sense a' tinglin' for many a year to come.

t3_kmr738,TIFU by almost breaking my GF's fingers,"Technically this isn't today's FU, but actually happened yesterday evening.

Being the void between Christmas &amp; New Year, and us both being off work for a couple of days, we decided to have a lazy day watching a few films, and having a few drinks (especially as we have quite a bit left over from Xmas, as we were limited in what we could do / who we could see etc).

As it got into the evening, and we'd had a few more drinks, one thing lead to another, and we were having sexy times. Everything was going great until we went to change position. We're still not entirely sure what exactly happened, but I hit her hand with my knee as we were moving, there was a loud crack, and my GF slumped over clutching her hand. And that was the end of any fun plans for the evening! 

We were both pretty sure she had at least 1 broken finger (based off the amount of pain &amp; the noise) &amp; I was thinking how we'd be able to get to A&amp;E, given we'd both been drinking. After about 30 mins, as it hadn't massively swollen, my GF (who is a nurse, so I'd trust her with these things) decided it probably wasn't actually broken, so we'd leave it for the morning &amp; see how it is then. A day later, it's still hurting, but can be moved at least, so seems she was right in it not being broken thankfully, as we're not really sure how we'd explain it if we had to go to the hospital!

TL;DR: Hit my GF's hand with my knee during sexy times &amp; thought I'd broken her finger(s)",60,10,tifu

I didn't notice my mistake until I was shutting down the computer and my heart sank. When you reply to the HR email is sends it to all the employees in HR (like 6 people at my company)

I called and left a voicemail explaining my mistake. I'm dreading work tomorrow and I'm debating whether to go or not. 

If it was another department I don't think I would be this stressed and If anyone has any advice it would be much appreciated.

I'm walking around looking at  stuff but I'm just not feeling it, I'm letting out  horrible gas every  10 minutes.

t3_kmq8b6,TIFU by getting a vasectomy,"This has been a continual series of events that is still ongoing. Before I get into my current situation, I‚Äôll explain a bit of backstory. I have a genetic condition called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type 3) and this causes my joints to be extremely hypermobile. As a result, growing up I needed several reconstructive surgeries just to be able to walk. This also affects my skin, making it harder for my wounds to heal‚ÄîI still have a scar on my foot from when I was twelve that will occasionally re-open to this day. In addition to all of this, I have another, unrelated, genetic condition that affects my vascular system. My heart is currently functioning at about 35% ejection fraction (blood output) and my aorta is ballooning. Oh, and I‚Äôm colorblind (this is actually significant for later). I‚Äôm really not sure how I‚Äôve survived to be 26, but I‚Äôm somewhat like a cockroach and don‚Äôt seem to die. At least I have an exceptionally high pain tolerance.

With that being said, these problems have led to a few different complications/concerns. The first is that sex is very painful. When I first lost my virginity, I was so traumatized that I told everyone I was asexual for 2 years because my entire penis turned black and my skin started falling off. Sex with a condom is also difficult because my skin is so thin that it can cause my skin to rip and basically mutes any good feelings that sex is supposed to bring, and there aren‚Äôt birth control pills for guys. With all these complications, I‚Äôm terrified of accidently getting a girl pregnant because then it‚Äôs out of my hands and both these conditions are a 50/50 chance of genetically passing it down. I could not mentally handle giving these problems to someone else. My solution? A vasectomy.

I came to this decision shortly after I began dating a girl who seemed highly accepting of all my genetic afflictions and understood these were genetic problems that could be passed down, so I could never have kids of my own. I happily scheduled a vasectomy figuring I could forever erase the concern of an accident. Well, a few weeks before the surgery, it suddenly dons on my girlfriend that this is a permanent thing, and that I will not be changing my mind, so I wake up to a breakup text and then never hear from her again. I was disappointed to say the least, but not deterred‚Äîthis needed to happen.

I was fortunate enough to find a highly skilled and knowledgeable surgeon who knew the ins and outs of my condition, and afterward it seemed like everything had gone fine. Not too much happened during the recovery, and after a slightly longer recovery period than normal, I was able to go out and do everything I needed to do.

Fast forward two months, and I started getting sharp pains. A few days later, my tactical turned black. I‚Äôm guessing that I never noticed anything happening because I don‚Äôt really react to pain the same as other people, and I never noticed a color change because I‚Äôm colorblind. Only once things started turning dark could I see a chance. To put this into perspective, I‚Äôm a very white guy who can camouflage myself by standing in front of a white picket fence. However, someone could‚Äôve photoshopped a picture of my balls onto the Criminal Minds character Derek Morgan and it wouldn‚Äôt‚Äôve looked out of place. I had to go in for an ultrasound and it turns out I had an infection brewing down there the entire time because my skin doesn‚Äôt like to knit together. I was put on Augmentin and sent home. A week later the pains get worse. I need to go in for another ultrasound, they find the infection is still there, and then I‚Äôm put on something else, stronger, and sent home. Pain gets worse, I go back, they put me on an epic amount of antibiotics and warn that if this doesn‚Äôt work I‚Äôll be hospitalized. During this whole process I need to waddle like a penguin, and it feels like I‚Äôm getting perpetually slammed in the nuts every minute.

I went to the doctor for a checkup after this awful experience and learn the infection is gone, but he thinks the pain will stay for a while. While there, I figure I‚Äôll check and see if this awful procedure actually worked and ask if I can use a room for a sperm sample; he told me to go home and bring one back . . . only problem is I can‚Äôt drive because of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and I live 40 miles away. I explained this problem to him, and his solution is that I should go to their public bathroom, masturbate, and then bring the sample back. Not something I‚Äôm comfortable with, but it seems far more appealing than asking my dad to drive me home so I can masturbate into a cup and then drive me all the way back. We go out to the main area where my doctor explains the situation to the lady at the front desk and leaves. As her and I are talking, a nurse overheard and started lecturing me about masturbating in public and that I need to go home to do that. This conversation took place in the waiting area, which quickly became very hot‚ÄîI was too mortified to explain the situation and instead just took the cup and left. My plan was that I could tell my dad they needed to see me again for something and he would drive me back without knowing . . . except when I was done, he‚Äôd left to go shopping. I ended up needing to have my next-door neighbor drive me 40 minutes to the doctor while I kept a cup of my semen concealed in my pocket.

By the time I got my test results the pain hadn‚Äôt improved, and they sent me in for yet another ultrasound and find that the infection damaged my epididymis. I‚Äôm currently unable to do anything physical while they decide whether or not to operate and remove the epididymis, which may lead to a whole other slew of problems. What should‚Äôve taken a week to recover from will likely take me 5+ months.

There is some good news, at least: I‚Äôm now sterile and can never pass on my awful genes or my awful luck.

TL;DR: My vasectomy caused a breakup, an infection, one of the most awkward moments of my life, tissue damage, and potentially another surgery. But at least I‚Äôm sterile!",41,5,tifu

The boy is about 10 years old and I've always had a good relationship with him and them. I asked him if he had ever used an axe before, and then I messed up because I absentmindedly then said 'have you ever been in a Turkish prison', using the quote from the great movie Airplane. Apparently his parents had never seen the movie before because they kept walking towards their house silently. It all didn't really process to me and I followed up by asking him if he had ever seen a grown man naked. This all just happened a few minutes ago and I am still processing it. I'm slightly afraid that they are going to call the authorities on me. It's a very small town and at the very least this will probably lead to some bad gossip about me.

During the last season of GOT me and my friends had a deal where if one of us hadn't watched the newest episode yet it was fair game to spoil. 

I missed S8 E2 where Arya fucks Gendry. I was vibing at my friends house and she brought it up. In my head Arya was still like 12 years old so I went ""No fucking way"". To prove me wrong she had to find the scene to show me and since it wasn't a major spoiler I didn't mind. 

This was the day after the release so it wasn't on any mainstream video services so obviously we tried pornhub because it was of that nature. We found it and started watching. About 30 seconds in her mam walks into the sitting room and since the sofa was angled in such a way she had full view of what we were watching and the pornhub logo above the video. Two 16 yo, one boy, one girl casualy watching porn in the sitting room. 

Needless to say I was asked quite politely to leave and so I left my friend to explain what happened. I've known them my whole life so it was easy to clear up. On a video call to my friend today she brought it up because she's rewatching the series over the Christmas break.

So to give you context, I'm 17 and when I visit the psychiatrist my parent/parents are with me. So what my stupid ass did was write on a piece of paper what I did and slide it into the file and hand the doctor the file. 

Now this is where my fuck up happened. I didn't specify anywhere that  none of my parents know about it and that I intend to keep it that way. I expected him to magically assume that. (I see how risky that is in retrospect).
 
So 30 seconds into the file the psychiatrist, right in front of both of them says something in my native language that resembles (pranav why did you do this and what exactly did you cut?) 
I immediately interrupted him and asked my parents to go outside for a moment. And the  I just hoped that to my parents cutting could mean anything... :/

We didn't talk about it after. 

And my stupid ass didn't learn still!
I needed to be re-evaluated from somewhere else and I bought the same file with me as it is (I don't know what I was thinking)

And this time there are students. There's like 3 of them and 2 of us sitting and discussing my case and not once, twice but several times did they talk about what I had written on the paper and interrogated me about it andy dad said that there wasn't anything he knew of and that I should have talked to him about it and he came to know about it first when the psychiatrist talked about it.And obviously I couldn't simply agree upon cutting myself infront of my dad so o simply denied doing any of it even tho the page clear said ""cut myself thrice"" and then they too didn't drag it.

At the store I got everything, and I am a little upset that it took a bit longer to find the Alligator. But I head over to the registers. I check and out of the 15 open there was one with only two carts so I head over there and start waiting. 

The first person took like 3 minutes to check out, nothing too bad, a little long but manageable. At this point I have been waiting in line for 3 minutes, the next person starts going so I am the next person in line, cool. I'll just browse reddit in the meantime.

I usually open it in mobile firefox (it keeps me logged in without having the app) I get on Instagram maybe once a month. On firefox, you can scroll through some posts while the page is still loading. Then, after it refreshes, the page snaps to a new post.

Today at work, there wasn‚Äôt anything to do, and a coworker and I were just sitting around. I got on Instagram (for once) and i see that picture of Mac Miller and someone listening to his music, and I am like ‚Äúhey, is this Mac Miller?‚Äù And turn my phone around to show them.

t3_kmm4r6,TIFU by accidentally tripping shrooms at work,"TLDR: I tried my first microdosing dose at work and it was amazingly enough to make me trip


This was actually yesterday, not today. 

So I work an office job, and it‚Äôs a desk job 8-5. Using a throw account for obvious reasons. 

Some backstory, I have been wanting to try microdosing for a while now for a lot of reasons but mostly because I am unmotivated no matter how hard I try to change my mindset and everything else the Ted talks have told me, and because I have a lot of mental health issues blah blah the usual. I have done a lot of research on microdosing and scaled the stuff out and everything. 

So anyway, I see a beginner dose is typically .1-.3 and I go for a solid .24ish to start, and I have tripped mushrooms in the past and never had a bad time. Now I was busy and drinking over the weekend so I didn‚Äôt want that to interfere. My dumbass decided to try my very first dose about an hour after I got to work on an empty stomach. 

I‚Äôm feeling fine, expected the dose to kick in like an hour after I took it right? I‚Äôm in the middle of scheduling a client, the phone call is going great I‚Äôm in a good mood, and all of the sudden it hits my like a ton of bricks. It was like I blinked and instantly felt like I was high. I start shaking and sweating ALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CONVERSATION. I used every anxiety coping method I knew of to keep myself calm and get this phone call over with while trying to sound as normal as possible. 

I schedule this lady just fine, but I am tripping. Visuals, that body and head feeling, and I can‚Äôt focus on SHIT. It was like a really weak trip, which would have been fine had I not been at WORK trying to microdose. 

I think okay a snack might help, BUT MADE IT WORSE. 

Eventually I realize I have to go home. So I tell my boss I‚Äôm not feeling well all while trying not to make eye contact because my pupils are blown. The drive home felt like rainbow road, not even joking. 

So basically I got to go home and trip in bed instead of going to work on a Monday, I guess this could have been worse but I definitely fucked up by trying to microdose my first dose on a Monday morning. 


Also I could like to add, please do NOT take this as a sign to or not to try microdosing, it has great effects and studies when done CORRECTLY. Take this was what NOT to do if you should try it. I forgot I am pretty sensitive to psychedelics and I had no eaten that day. Also this is not telling anyone to do drugs, I have a history is substance abuse and this is in no way me condoning getting high at work.",6,14,tifu
t3_kmm0p7,TIFU by closing my eyes while running on a treadmill.,"This happened a while ago but thats besides the point

So when i was like 9 i decided to jog on my cousins treadmill while her and her uncle were in the living room taking pictures (we were getting ready to go to a party.) As i was running i got this really bright idea to close my eyes and still run on the treadmill. Now i didnt tell you guys this but, right behind the treadmill, there was a washing machine that wasnt used because it was old. It was just like sitting there.

So when i closed my eyes and was running i was proud of myself because i thought i was so close to the thing where you could hold on. Needless to say, i was so close to falling off and i figured that out when all the sudden i just felt like a car ran over me. ""BOOM BOOM BAM IHRUWIHSFKW"" Thats all i heard while being banged into this washing machine and the treadmill still going. My cousin and her uncle ran into the room and saw me on the treadmill ground. They turned it off and were so concered asking me what happened and was i okay.

I ran into the bathroom without answering any questions and my lip was busted and my arm had this nasty scar looking like i got road burn from trying to bomb a hill on a skateboard. They patched me up and i went up stairs to get my phone and call my mom. My mom didnt answer so i just BROKE DOWN.

We still went to that party but i was sitting in the corner with a mean looking face. I lied to everyone about how i fell for a while but i recently told my cousin the truth.

TL;DR: I closed my eyes while running on a treadmill and fucked myself up when i fell",30,0,tifu

     It started driving down the road and my stomach rolled over and I had the sudden urge to go. I thought I can hold it, then I think I could hold it, then the moment if I‚Äôm not going to make it. I was in the left turn lane waiting for the light to turn green to make it to the gas station on the corner.

t3_kmkmls,TIFU by running out of protein powder," 

At  the beginning of the pandemic, I fell victim to the COVID 20. Because  I'm working from home, and because I built a home gym in our  out-building, I decided it was a good time to get back into shape.

So,  for the past 9 months I've been doing a fairly intense workout regimen,  and I'm about halfway through the second version of it. I always have a  whey protein shake after my workout, and a casein shake before bed.  After the first few weeks, I was no longer super sore the day after my  workouts.

Well, this Sunday I  finished off one tub of casein protein, and went to go grab the backup  out of the pantry. Only, it wasn't there. I checked my last order, and  sure enough I only ordered 1 tub.

I  figured that because I've been doing this for 9 months, I'd skip  ordering casein right away to see if I really needed it. Big mistake.

Yesterday's  workout was probably the most intense workout yet. It had me do 8  different exercises, and do continuous sets of each exercise until my  rep count fell below a certain number. Today I woke up and my entire  body hurts to move. It hasn't been like this since I first started  working out years ago.

The rest of the exercises this week are set up the same way, and my protein won't be here until Saturday. FML.

I am not even sure how the employer I signed a work contract with even found my reddit as it isn't linked to any personal email, my name, or other social media usernames. But the post they linked me to was a COMMENT I made on a post in r/illegallifeprotips where a user suggested people lie and fake documents on their resume to get a job. My comment was essentially saying that was a terrible idea and I would just really sell myself on the duties I have done in the resume rather than lie and fake documents. I tried explaining how I did not make the post but rather a comment on the post basically telling people not to obey the post. This wasn't acceptable to them apparently, the recruiter and his manager I went through to get the job even went as far as to tell my ""future employer"" that the post was nothing to worry about. I guess they didn't accept that answer because I got a call later saying my offer of employment had been rescinded for ""embellishments on my resume"" but when asking for specific examples of embellishments I on what the embellishments were they wouldn't ever give me any and just said ""I have embellishments on my resume"". They had encouraged me to put in a 2 weeks notice so I could start with them early as well so now I have already quit my current job but lost the job I was going to over a reddit post that i didn't even make.. This position would have been a $20k a year pay raise from my current job and I lost it over some stupid confusion and my reddit account being linked to the title of a post I commented on basically. I had already signed all sorts of work agreements with them and had a start date...

TLDR: My future employer found my reddit account somehow, linked a comment I made to the title of the post, decided they didn't like the title of the post or the sub it was in, explained it my comment and not my post, rescinded my offer for ""embellishments"" and never told me what those embellishments were.",19667,1902,tifu

This happened last night. We started the evening by watching The Hobbit, but we had to cut it short because it kept buffering, so we switched to Netflix and voted on Vivarium, a 13+ thriller. It looked innocent enough, 
It is a weird film and after watching we agreed on it being creepy weird film and nothing more to say about that. 

Well now, time for bed, but both the kids couldn't get settled they felt uneasy.
 time past and the uneasiness turned to fear and although I promised to sit up till they fell asleep with lights on, it didn't work, so around 5 this morning, we where 3 huddled together in the living room,on the sofa bed, my not so small kids sleeping on top of me, like they dit when they where two year olds, and me cursing myself for not figuring out that the weirdness and the creepiness of that film was worse than the splatter of the Hobbit.

I remember swallowing it and thinking it was a shard of glass at first. She was mortified but I said it was my fault. I had to go around looking like hillbilly Jane for a week because I was living in semi-rural China and no nearby dentist had the right composite paste to use to repair it.

t3_kmiogr,TIFU by injuring myself at work and not telling anyone,"I'm a nurse and this morning I slipped and hurt my ankle. At the time I thought I just twisted it and I knew we had a full schedule so I just thought I could walk it off. My ankle throbbed more and more as time went on and putting pressure on it became harder. A few patients asked if I was hurt and I downplayed it, just saying I twisted my ankle. I had seen the doctor I work under and other nurses, but every time I crossed paths with them, I was just standing not walking, so they didn't know.

After a few hours, my ankle hurt so bad that I didn't think I'd be able to continue. I debated whether or not to say anything at this point. I was really embarrassed and should have said something to begin with and felt awkward bringing it up now. It turned out that I didn't even have to say anything, the doctor finally saw me limping, put me in a wheelchair and my coworker wheeled me down to the orthopedic unit to get checked out.

I was/am mortified. The ortho said I was likely working on a fractured ankle and he couldn't believe I was able to walk and stand for hours. I explained that at first I thought it was a minor sprain but it got worse and worse until it became unbearable. I didn't realize I was hurt so bad. He said it's definitely more than a minor sprain. I'm currently waiting for x-rays to see if there's a fracture or if it's a terrible sprain. Needless to say, my ankle is killing me, I'm embarrassed and the doctor I work under wasn't happy I didn't tell him that I was hurt (rightfully so).

TL;DR: Hurt my ankle really bad but continued to work on it without saying anything.

t3_kmiaff,TIFU by Skipping Senior Prom,"Obligatory this happened over 2 and a half years ago when I was about to graduate from High School.

Anyway, I went to a hoity-toity private school where the students wore blazers and nice pants. It was also a boarding school. Much fancy.

This school makes a very big deal out of the dances, which they throw in the gymnasium that is its own building. And the campus is built right next to a lake that the students sail on.

We also have a crew called ‚ÄúBush Patrol,‚Äù which is a group of adults who ride around in a golf cart and use flashlights to make sure students aren‚Äôt out doing sexual things.

Well, my friends were all going to Prom but I was salty because I asked the same girl to every, single school dance but she rejected me every time. So my stubborn ass asked her to Senior Prom and she said, ‚ÄúNope.‚Äù 

So me, being as angry as I was that my final plan failed, decided to skip Senior Prom.

Where did I go, you ask?

Well. This is where the fuck-up happened.

I figured all the adults would be busy chaperoning the Prom and not bother to wander over to the lake area which was quite aways down from the gymnasium. My school has a 3-mast schooner that‚Äôs put out on the water near the summertime, so I decided to take some of my clothes off and go for a dip.

And, much like Nemo, I swam over to the boat that was just chilling in the middle of the lake. All I had on at this point was my underwear, and after I checked to make sure no one was around, I also took that off.

I was alone out there, just naked me and this giant boat.

It was awesome.

Until Bush Patrol decided to come my way and asked me to get out of the water.

Me, still being mad, said ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and gave these adults a full frontal.

I spent every evening after that night in detention until I graduated.

t3_kmi8hg,TIFU by ordering a judgmental cooking appliance.,"So the stove in our apartment exploded. Nobody got hurt, but now we have nothing to cook real meals with. My insufferable housemates are the sort of people who tend to complain about a problem rather than trying to solve it, so oftentimes it is up to me to fix these things because nobody else will.

Of course, I don't have the knowledge necessary to fix this thing. And calling in somebody else to take care of it would be prohibitively expensive. Technically it's the landlord's job to come in and fix shit when it explodes, but that's not gonna happen no matter how much my compatriots beg for it.

I hopped on amazon and looked for an affordable solution. Found some countertop stove burners and figured that would be a good start - we wouldn't be baking any turkeys, but at least we could boil pasta and fry up burgers.

Now, I had an important decision to make. I quickly narrowed it down to two options that seemed like clear winners - one, a butane burner as seen in places like Jun's Kitchen, and two, an electric burner as seen on every tacky youtube cooking channel with a white background.

I liked the idea of the butane burner in concept, but in practice, I didn't want the monkeys I live with being anywhere near something that operated on gas or produced an open flame. Plus, back before my life was in shambles I used to have a nice flat glass electric stovetop in my old place. I figured it would be nice to have something so simple and reliable again.

Now, this part was the fuckup. In disqualifying one option based on the intelligence of my compatriots, I didn't consider the possibility that the other option might be non-viable for other reasons.

Fast forward to this morning, when I finally got my hands on the thing. I opened it up and read the instructions, wanting to be sure there wasn't anything important that could be easily overlooked by the others when trying to use it. It was at this point when I learned what the phrase ""induction cooktop"" meant.

See, what I thought I was seeing was a miniaturized version of a glass stovetop with a heating element underneath that gets hot when you turn it on. What could be simpler? How could you possibly screw that up?

Well, it was not that.

An induction cooktop is *like* that, except self-aware and judgmental. Perhaps that's not objectively true, but it is close enough to the truth to be a problem. What it actually does is that, supposedly, it uses an ""electromagnetic field"" to heat ""only the pan"". What the purpose of this is I cannot possibly fathom, given that it still produces hot surfaces that are unsafe to touch for a while after use. At least the instructions say as much, I didn't get to see it for myself.

Turns out, the ""magnetic"" part of ""electromagnetic"" is a problem. Why? Because it only works with magnetic cookware. By which I mean that when you turn the thing on, it senses whether your pan is sufficiently magnetic for its purposes and, if not, refuses to heat up at all.

I tried every piece of cookware in the house, most of which had some amount of metal content, and the burner refused them all. Fuck me for failing to do my due research, I guess? In my defense, I had never before heard of the idea of taking something that works fine and making it inconceivably worse by adding extra conditions to it being able to perform its most basic function.

**TL;DR:** Bought an induction cooktop to replace an exploded stove and didn't do my research so I didn't know that none of the pots and pans in the house would work with it.",40,18,tifu
t3_kmi40m,TIFU by trying to calm my dogs down,"This actually happened yesterday morning. I was cleaning my house, tidying up to get some work done when my two dogs decided to summon the hounds of hell. They've done this a few times, but always inside, usually when I'm leaving the house and they want to go with me. Well, not yesterday. Yesterday, they were in my fully fenced backyard and decided to start howling, barking, and generally just doing the dog equivalent of screaming at the top of their lungs. I was really embarrassed and worried someone would call the cops and think my dogs were being abused or something so I ran outside and started begging them to please stop, however, the situation got to me after a minute and I started giggling while hysterically saying ""please stop"" and ""please don't do this"". Apparently my near-hysterical voice sounds very much like I'm begging for my life because I managed to get the girls calmed down and in the house and about 30 seconds later my neighbor came charging into the house with a gun and 911 on speed-dial with the intent that he was going to save my life. He made it about 3 steps in the door and saw me alone, eating mints, and just stopped and started looking around. He then confesses to me that he and his wife thought I was being murdered or something because they heard me begging (for my life) while my dogs were making sounds they'd never heard before. I'm so embarrassed I'm afraid to go get my mail incase I bump into them. Thanks girls. Honestly though, it's good to know they have my back incase something ever did happen!

I have to keep this short because I literally have to run out the door. But my cat and I like to play tag, or even hide and seek, where he'll run and hide and I'll find him. Then I run and hide and he finds me. Sometimes he chases me, sometimes he waits for me to hide. It's really up to him which game we're playing, to be honest.

But, about 5 minutes ago, he was chasing me, ran into the room, he tried to cut me off by shortcutting under the bed, so I went over the bed. I made a mad dash out of the door into the kitchen where I tried to go around the kitchen island. He saw what I was doing and, again, tried to cut me off by going the other way around. I tried to stop, spin, and turn and my hands swung widely. My pinkie finger hit the granite counter top right at the knuckle before the tip. It hurt like hell at first, I thought it was broken. Now I can at least move it so I am convinced it's bruised at worst. If it swells up and gets nasty, then I'll post pics.

t3_kmhjfe,TIFU by buying a book in the wrong language,"So, I collect foreign language books, anything from antiques to newly published material. It's sorta like a puzzle, where you use Wikipedia grammar pages and online dictionaries to put together the pieces, and you end up coming out with some good knowledge about whatever language you were reading. If they're obscure, I might take photocopies and make a translation. 

Anyways, I was at a bookstore looking specifically for one book in Turkish and one book in Spanish. Being in the US, the Spanish selection was naturally pretty abundant. I noticed a few Portuguese and Italian books mixed in (both languages had their own shelves, albeit much smaller), but I didn't think much of it because those languages are really distinct from each other. This bookstore is pretty big so they actually did have a few books in Turkish. 

I was googling the authors to see whether their books were translations or original texts (books sourced in their original language are generally better material than translations, although there are many exceptions). I was kinda in a hurry because I had places to be, so I didn't actually open up the book. I found a book by a Turkish author who published her books in both Turkish and English. The cover page had ""Turkish"" penciled in, accompanied with a super cheap price. I liked the author's wikipedia page, mostly because of her political views, so I figured that her book would be perfect. I bought it and took it home to start digesting.

I open up the book and start reading. I immediately see a bunch of romanized Slavic words and Russian-esque phrases. Oh no. The book labeled as Turkish was not in Turkish. I eventually piece together that the book is in Croatian. I don't know how a Croatian translation of a Turkish book ended up in a US book store, but I can see how the bookstore got confused by the languages. They're not related at all, but the author's name was in Turkish, so they probably just assumed the same thing as I did. This was a really silly blunder of mine, mostly because it meant that I only read the author's name and the store's penciled in ""Turkish."" I know what Turkish looks like, and I immediately recognized the book's language as Slavic, so I blame myself for this. I'll probably keep the book just for collection's sake. I'm not some kind of Karen who'd bitch about this kind of thing, and the story behind this book is pretty rad, so I don't exactly feel bad about this mistake. I did lose $5 though, and I still need a book in Turkish.

TL;DR: wasn't paying attention to the book I was getting, store mislabeled the language and I just went with it. This is my fault because I knew what the languages looked like but just didn't pay attention.",12,2,tifu

My friend who lived right across the street from me had a labrador and I read that labradors are naturally incredible swimmers and I told him about this and we thought, what if his new labrador puppy was the greatest dog swimmer in the world! Our kid minds lost it, we jumped up, grabbed the dog, and ran outside. It went well at first however he had to leave for his soccer game and told me to keep going and keep teaching him. So we kept going for like 20 minutes when I got hungry. I went inside, my disrespectful child mind opened their fridge and made me a sandwich, it took me about 15 minutes to eat it, I was watching something on the tv and I headed home... Friend got back, dog got stuck in the pool, lacked air and went to a better place. This moment was my biggest fuck up ever.

I stupidly put my pile of clothes, towel and sex toys beside the sink, and went to lock the door behind me. In that time, the glass dildo slipped and clattered (LOUDLY) to the floor, smashing cleanly into two pieces. I‚Äôm positive the whole house would have heard it, the noise was ridiculous and all the other rooms were open.  As I went to open the bathroom door to inconspicuously stash the pieces in my room, I could hear my dad call ‚Äúwhat was that!?‚Äù from the other side. I stuffed the pieces behind me in the waistband of my leggings, said ‚Äúnothing, don‚Äôt worry!‚Äù and prayed he wouldn‚Äôt interrogate me more.

One of the people I matched with does not speak English as a first language and is learning with the help of translator apps. I'm going to keep this intentionally vague as I've never felt confortable sharing anything private that isn't solely about me online.This only came up because they brought it up, as I am not the type of idiot white person (language and race are not the same but if I had to guess the race aspect only makes this worse) to fetishize that type of shit.

Or so I thought. A couple messages in I joked about playing a game of telephone with google translate (dumb af but I was trying to keep it lighthearted) with a translated message. Immediate unmatch.

I thought it just went with the subject but clearly it came off that other way I didn't intend.

I went to go check out his account and my debit card was linked to it. I talk to him about it and told him not to do that again, de linked my card, and then proceeded to get in contact with Nintendo support via text. Over our text conversation, they told me they couldn‚Äôt refund me as I had used a refund before, my one allotted refund. My stubborn self was determined to receive my $50 back, so I called the support line with my 12 digit number for my case. I got in contact with a representative and told him the situation and he said he would look into it. After a couple of minutes he informed me he had to delete my brothers account because it was in violation of COPA laws because he was five and had my credit card on it and was making purchases. In a panic I told him he didn‚Äôt and he told me that it had to be done and that all the saved data will be deleted from his 20~ games. I was heartbroken. Me and my brother spent day in and day out playing the switch for the past year. I spent numerous hours every day playing with them whether it be outside, with his toys, Roblox, phone apps, the Nintendo switch, etc. I tried calling back to fix it and got in touch with you more representatives and they both told me that the account had to be deleted. I was in tears. I knew my little brother is going to be devastated in the next couple days as they said that they will do the deleting in 48 hours. There is no way to transfer save data from profile to profile. It‚Äôs going to be so hard to tell him that all he has worked for and all that we did together is now gone permanently. I fucked up. I feel so bad. 

I‚Äôm crying typing this. That kid has so much of my heart and I never ever wanna heart him. I feel so so bad. So so so so so so bad. I hope everything will be alright. Everything  happens for a reason but this hurts me and I can only imagine how much he‚Äôs gonna be hurt. Why would they let us set up the account saying he‚Äôs 5 (4 at the time) and let us put a credit card on it? If theyre saying that‚Äôs illegal why don‚Äôt they just prevent it from the start so this doesn‚Äôt happen to anyone‚Äôs kids/siblings again? Ugh. Thank you all for listening. Please have a good day and God bless.

t3_km7i8b,TIFU by reading my niece a bedtime story,"This happened a few days ago on Xmas Eve.

For Christmas this year we went away with all my in-laws (allowed where I live). We all arrived Christmas Eve, and as we were unpacking  there was a a big ker-fuffle amongst the other adults as Santa's presents got misplaced and were eventually found after some people had already begun the 5hour return trip home to look for them there. 

So as all the adults were already tense and stressed I figured as the only one without kids I will help out with bedtime and offered to read the oldest (4) a bedtime story.

This is the first year that 4 has really been into Christmas and Santa and was really excited. As mentioned, I don't have any kids so therefore I am not accustomed to all the questions they ask.

After the bedtime story (which was a Christmas story) I was asked so many Santa questions like, is he coming tonight? Does Santa know we are in this house and not my normal house? What presents does he give people? Etc. Now, while answering that last question I mentioned that good children get presents but if they have been naughty they get coal. This was something I thought she already knew, but it appears she didn't.

This was followed up by questions of what is coal and where does Santa get it from. As this is not a Santa question I was prepared for, I panicked and said the first thing that came to mind, which was ""coal is what remains of something after a fire, so if you have been naughty Santa burns your presents and gives you the coal instead"".

As soon as I said this I could see the panic in her eyes as she processed this new info and started to panic about if she has been good enough this year, just what you want before bedtime on Xmas Eve.

Same situation for my husband.

So anyway, I make another call to the DMV today. I‚Äôm on speakerphone - keep that in mind. Customer service rep right off the bat is telling me it‚Äôs my fault and I shouldn‚Äôt have waited so long to call. She seems to get increasingly annoyed with my questions and requests to verify information and keeps cutting me off. I‚Äôm maintaining my casual conversational tone (my job involves a lot of abrasive customers so I‚Äôm used to this.) Essentially it comes down to I have to go into an office. Okay no biggie, I ask her if I can check my husband‚Äôs information as well. She gives me a hassle about how he has to be the one to request the information and the rudeness subtlety escalates until she finally lets me speak long enough to tell her he‚Äôs right here, if she‚Äôs okay with doing it right now. She sighs and says it‚Äôs fine. I pass the phone to my husband.
SUDDENLY THIS WOMAN IS A DIFFERENT PERSON and the epitome of excellent customer service. Even her voice changed. He asked the same exact questions I had, she never cut him off or told him he was wrong, and was actually very helpful and looked into the issues. 10/10 service. The call ends and we hear the distinct click of a receiver. Didn‚Äôt bother to look at the phone because we heard the click.

Immediately, me being me, I start going off about ‚Äúwhy the f*ck was she such a b*tch to me and so nice to you??‚Äù We start joking and my husband tells me it‚Äôs probably because I have a b*tch voice etc etc so we‚Äôre going back and forth and I am just absolutely sh*tting on the customer service rep.

So I go to moms, clear my head, and start making changes, which included talking about rehab. My genius mom decided I needed help ASAP so she devised a really good plan to get me a 72 hour hold mental lock up so I can get in to see a psychiatrist faster. 

Cue fuck up. I went all in. Yes, there were symptoms; suicidal idealization, drug use, days of foggy insanity (apparently mania), and I let them know about it all.

Ok with that out of the way I will begin this massive f up. In my friend group (ages 15-17) we have a Secret Santa every year. This year we made lists to make sure no one got screwed over and made a spending limit of about $20. I put the normal stuff you may expect from a teen on reddit, gaming stuff, anime merch, and a couple of inside joke items. 


Fast forward 3 weeks to today, we all meet up. We were having fun, eating pizza, socially distancing and being safe. It was great....until present time.

That was until i opened the box and saw a 5ft body pillow of 02 (she‚Äôs an anime girl, just search it up). At first i thought it was the funniest shit, until it dawned on me that i would have to take it home.

The more i thought about it, the more this seemed hopeless, there was no chance my parents would think nothing of it, so i decided the best option was to take of the covering of the anime character and hide it in my bag, and to call this body pillow, a ‚Äúback pillow‚Äù. 

I got into the car to go home when my mother asked me what it was, I replied saying it was a back pillow, and she didnt bat an eye.(ive had back pains all my life so its not a crazy excuse). It was going great, i got home, put it down on the couch and went to shower. I got out of the shower to hear my dad coming back from work. I thought nothing of it and went to get changed, i hid the anime cover and went downstairs for something to eat.

I had to stir the coat around in the dye for 15 minutes straight, then every 5 minutes for 45 minutes. I was wearing gloves while doing this, but unknowingly pushed too hard/far into the dye, causing it to fill my gloves and splatter onto my arms.

t3_km6au5,TIFU Im an idiot!,"Tl;Dr never let me find new friend groups to be in.

Buckle up ladies and gentlemen this is gonna be a long one so you've been warned. 

So a little background me K R and M (16F 15F 16M 17F) are kinda like a squad or a group of 4 however you wanna call us feel free To call us whatever you like. 


So im dating K and R is dating M so we are able to manage our group well kinda but lately it's been a hell hole and i hate that i did this. 

Onto the main story. So back in july 2019 i got into a group of friends and we had a decent time before i found out how toxic the group was lol. And in January this year one of my friends suggested that i introduce them to K so that's what i did. BIG FUCKING MISTAKE. 

I went on quite a few breaks from that group because it was becoming a hassle to handle K told me she would handle it. (i was 15 and she was 14 at the time.) so i thought nothing of it. She took care of the group and i had a nice week off i thought that was it right? Wrong. 

I heard that one of my friends who's probably 18M now got into a fight with K about one of the friends getting into stupid shit with Him so K tired to stop it.

This year i feel like my mental health has plummeted but is only slowly getting back up today But I've already texted R and told K apologIzing profusely and crying in K's arms about the mistake i made.

February roles around K's birthday passes and i went on another break i was becoming more and more neglectful of that group. One of my friends who i think is 17M now had already gotten into multiple fights with K because he wanted to have fun with her.

I got furious when i came back and told him to buzz off or they're would be consequences next time. (still fought K multiple times in the future) he seemed to understand and apologized so i thought that was it but this isn't done yet we're only getting into when R comes into play. 

So R was introduced to the group and he really enjoyed some of the people except when they got rough he tried defusing stuff but more and more drama kept coming and his mental health started declining aswell and by September K had gotten a bunch of anger issues too when she's snapped at multiple people and was diagnosed with PTSD (from an event i won't get into) and severe depression.

By October people actually started picking on her for being depressed always saying that she's faking it while very few people actually believed her and were concerned for her. She's even had many people tell her that nobody cares that she's depressed and another guy encouraged her to kill herself.

Now if some of you have seen my recent posts i won't go into detail about the couple cation incident that recently just concluded. (i learned how to cook eggs and bacon and cleaned the house while K's parents were at work) 

But R recently called me and was in tears telling me that he's about to lose what little of that group he had left while everyone else had just left him. (the last guy left is a generally good guy) and he didn't know what to do.

So now at the end of 2020 the entire group is essentially gone we only have contact with 3 of the people in that group yet we don't even see them everyday.

t3_km67sk,TIFU by writing a 15 page love letter during Quarantine,"I(f18) had this huge crush on this boy(19) during quarantine. We had a short summer romance August 2019 until he left for college. He is by far the most attractive guy I have ever seen and everything about the time we had together was amazing to me. I would truly do anything to go back in time and experience it all again, but I‚Äôve realized the past is the past. This is long so feel free to go to the TL;DR 

Anyways, we were snapping a lot during quarantine and actually met up once. I hadn‚Äôt seen him for about four months at that point and I thought I had moved on, but all the emotions hit me so hard when we were finally together. I truly couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about him for days. From what he sent on snap, he seemed like he was into me again too. 

So, I started writing in my notes app pretty much every single detail I could remember about him. I wanted a place to vent and put my thoughts into words. I wrote about the first time I ever saw him, the first time I noticed he liked me (he made the first moves btw), our first kiss, just all of that type of stuff. It was all very complimentary and sweet towards him. It was what I thought to be a beautiful chronological story of the relationship from my perspective. If anyone were to take the time and do that for me, I think I would legit explode from excitement. 

I didn‚Äôt realize I had written so much until I put it into a google doc and it ended up being 15 pages!! To make things less weird and less stalkerish (or possibly more weird depending on your opinion!), throughout quarantine, I also wrote down all of my memories with three other guys/relationships and their letters also ended up being 14-16 pages each. I have only recently realized that most people aren‚Äôt freaks like me and can‚Äôt remember things as vividly as I can. I thought everybody could remember just as well as I could. I kind of wrote theirs for giggles once I learned I could remember so much. Plus, I needed to kill time somehow. My feelings towards them were of course genuine, but different than the feelings I had for Summer Romance Boy. Those relationships were all in the past and I thought I could still have something with my fling from last summer. 

So, once I finished the letters, I decided to just fuck it and give them all out to my boys. Everything I wrote in them was very nice (probably sickening sweet at some points and cringey I can‚Äôt lie) and I never wrote down any of the bad memories, so I thought it would be a nice quarantine surprise! I just wanted some spice in my life. My girlfriends also wrote some letters to give out to people and we were going to have a road trip around our city and leave our letters at their front doors. 

So, a few days before we were going to deliver our letters I asked Summer Romance Boy if I could have his address. He lived on the other side of town and when we met up it was usually in the middle of us, so I didn‚Äôt know where he exactly lived. I really wanted things to escalate with him because I could still feel the sparks. I told him I had something to give him, but he declined. I was upset because I did work hard on the letter and I wanted him to read it, so I said I could email it to him. He agreed and I sent it. 

After 30 minutes of painful waiting and wondering what he was going to say, he finally texted me back and he really liked it!! He said that nobody has ever done anything that sweet before for him! I was ecstatic! It was really late at night when we were having this conversation, so he said he was tired, but he sincerely said he wanted to talk more to me later. From how the conversation was going, it seemed like he really liked me back. I was so excited for him to text me in the morning! 

The next day, I was so anxious for a response from him that I actually vomited. I waited and waited for him to text me. I snapped him my daily Streaks picture and he left me on read, which was kind of unusual. I waited two days for him to reach out until I eventually asked him if he wanted to talk. He basically texted me that the letter was just very weird especially since we weren‚Äôt dating, which I completely understand. I was pretty devastated for a bit from the rejection because I thought he liked it. However, he doesn‚Äôt owe me anything and I respect that.  

Before I gave out my other letters, I contacted the three other boys and asked if they were cool with receiving a 15 page love letter about them. I didn‚Äôt want to feel anymore stalkerish than I already felt and I didn‚Äôt want to ruin any of my other connections. They all agreed that it was cool and that they were excited to read them!! They‚Äôve all told me even recently that they still look at them from time to time and that my words mean a lot to them. Nothing that romantic happened afterwards between any of us but we are all on good terms. 

I don‚Äôt regret writing my love letter to my Summer Romance Boy. Honestly, I thought about him way too much and the letter let me put my memories with him to rest. Now, I don‚Äôt think about any of the other boys I wrote about that much either! I can finally put the past behind me and move forward with my love life. I‚Äôve also learned that brevity is the soul of wit. 

However, it still haunts me from time to time to wonder about what could have happened between Summer Romance Boy and me if I never gave the letter to him. It still haunts me to think about what he might have said the next morning if I texted him sooner. It still haunts me knowing that one moment he really appreciated the gesture and the next time he was kind of disgusted by me. I still yearn to text him sometimes, but I know I shouldn‚Äôt. I would do anything to have him back again, but I know it will never be.

TL;DR: I was bored during quarantine and had good intentions. I wrote a couple 15 page love letters to past boyfriends. The boy who I had a summer fling with and liked the most enjoyed the letter a lot originally, until he changed his mind and thought it was really weird because we weren‚Äôt a couple. I wish that things could be different between us and that I could still text him, but it is what it is.",18,21,tifu

Actually four days ago (I‚Äôve been in the hospital. So backstory, I own a 1938 BMW 750cc sidecar bike. I like to tinker with it and repair stuff from time to time.

I had a super stuck bolt on the  intake from the carb to the head and I pulled out some trusty PB blaster and a propane bottle torch. I heat up the bolt, spray some PB on and the next bit is fuzzy, because I‚Äôm not exactly sure what happened. The PB ignited, and the heat must have combusted some of the rubber fuel line, and the next thing I know, I‚Äôm flying against the wall with my face stinging and looking at my mangled hand.

I get up, grab my keys in shock, drive to the nearby hospital because I don‚Äôt want to spend $4k on an ambulance ride, and get checked in. They tell me I need emergency surgery to reconstruct the hand, and I may lose some fingers due to the fact I‚Äôm missing large chunks of tissue.

Post surgery, I get up, I only lost one finger, got minor burns and shrapnel across my face, lost hearing in my left ear, found out I‚Äôm highly resistant to painkillers and anesthesia, and just had a first time hospital stay. Plus my garage needs new glass and my bike needs new parts. 
Hospital Bill? 42k, plus change and a separate anesthesia fee and surgeon fee.

We try again, declined. I send him to Western Union. On his bike, because he doesn‚Äôt own a car. I try to send the cash but my transactions are all declined. Mind you I have plenty of $ in the bank, so that‚Äôs not the issue. I send him back to the ATM, and now my account is blocked. I finally had to Paypal some cash to a friend of his.

I just got home from a late Christmas dinner type thing with my girlfriend and her mom and stepdad. It was great. The food was good. Everything was a ok. But one minor detail 

Her stepdad and I are very competitive. Especially at eating. We always try to purest each other. We went to Red Lobster (for those of you out of the states it‚Äôs basically a seafood style restaurant) and they have all you can eat shrimp on Mondays. 

We get our food. Each a plate of grilled shrimp and shrimp scampi. We devour it within probably 5 minutes and each get another. And another. And another. In total, we both ate 18 plates of shrimp. 8 from me and 10 from him. 

We leave. We drive our separate ways and I get home about half an hour later. I walk in and say hi to my mom, my dog and my sister. Then my mom asks if I can take my dog for a walk since she has been inside all day. 

This is where the fuck up happens. 

I agree to take her because I usually love doing it! It‚Äôs calming, I get some time to myself to listen to music and just enjoy being outdoors when I‚Äôm usually stuck inside. I get about half way through (about 3/4 of a mile) and I feel it. My stomach starts turning. I think ‚Äúoh shit. This isn‚Äôt good.‚Äù So I try to pick up the pace. I get to my house. Go around back because I thought it would be faster. It wasn‚Äôt. The door was locked. So I leave my dog at the back door (we have a fence so she can just chill there for a second) I haul ass to the front of the house. Burst through the door and into the bathroom where I proceed to break the Geneva Convention for about 20 minutes. No more shrimp scampi for a while

So last night I drank one of those cocktails in a can while my boyfriend had a few beers, and we were feeling each other‚Äôs  ~sexual~ vibes. He suggested taking a shower to start out, so we start feeling each other up and I go down on him. My boyfriend is really enjoying himself as I try out different bj techniques since I was drunk and feeling experimental. After a few minutes of this, my knees were hurting so he helped me up and I started to feeling super dizzy and lightheaded as he‚Äôs trying to kiss me. I pushed him away and said that I needed to sit down or get some water, so he jumps out and grabs me a cup of water, then I started gagging and eventually threw up in the shower. (Thank god he was already out of the shower because Buffalo Mac and cheese is not attractive to throw up.) I was so embarrassed and worried he was going to leave me in the shower but he helped me rinse off and rubbed my back as I puked some more.

In comes marching the paramedics and fire department looking for an injured man with the name (for anonymity we will call him ""Jon Snow."" I know not very original or cool anymore, but with my newfound time I've invested in audiobooks. I'm already on book 4. ) 

Anyway I tell them ""oh hang on, there's no injury I know of. Let me go ask my station supervisor."" (I know good lil worker bee me. But seeing as I've been back at the station for a total of 5 minutes, I don't know wtf is going on) 

So I go back out to the loading dock shouting for my boss 

""JIM! HEY JIM, THE PARAMEDICS ARE HERE LOOKING FOR AN INJURED JON SNOW. DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT?"" 

Jim "" What? No, there's been no accident here. Well the shop just closed up, let's make sure there's no one in the customer area."" So he leads the paramedics around the station looking for Mr. Snow. 

Jim proceeds to come back into the loading dock as we are in the middle of our evening sort and have 10 or so minutes to get the truck out to the ramp. 

""Well there's no Mr. Snow here."" 

That's when another coworker chimes in and says 

""Oh you're looking for Mr. Jon Snow? I had a package for him I put over here."" 

Leads the paramedics to the ground bin 

""See right here, here's a package for Mr. Jon Snow."" 

*Paramedics open the package* 

It's a fricken life alert that was pressed, triggered or sounded when it was tossed into the bin.

I immediately started looking in my presents to see if it slipped off my hand and I started looking more and more franitcally. I started looking under the couch, everywhere you could think of. I asked my cousin who was sitting next to me if she saw it slip off and she immediatly was like You Had it for 15 minutes and you already lost it. That got my familys attention real quick.

A few hours later I went to the bathroom and when I went to go change it I couldn‚Äôt find it. Assuming maybe it had just fallen out when I sat down I checked the toilet and nothing.

Well, except for making Snow Boys right now, which really seems more like a exercise in frustration than anything. So I thought Stardew Valley would give her a nice change. I also got Lets Go! Evee from my parents.

Now I tried out Stardew Valley on Christmas Day after a few too many Irish Coffees had been drank, and my wife had fallen asleep...and I realllly like it. I played all day Saturday while we recovered from our caffeinated Jameson binge while she watched The Office because there are only a few days left for that. She tried out Stardew too, but just couldn‚Äôt into it. So I kinda hogged the Switch all Saturday. 

On Sunday she decided to try out Lets Go! Evee while I watched The Mandalorian, and she got reallly into it. Powering through, really Catching. Them. All.

I even watched her beat Misty last night, exclaiming that even today that Starmi would kick my ass like it did when I was 8.

During a weekly supply run I spotted a 1kg (2.2 pound) bag of Brazil nuts on special. ‚ÄúHey, those would go well with beer‚Äù I thought.

That night I FaceTimed a friend and got through around half the bag while drinking a six pack. In the morning I had a slight stomach ache but figured it was because I drank too much.

The next afternoon I had a surprise call from an old friend. Because I‚Äôd skipped lunch, I snacked on more nuts while we were chatting. Later that night I had a few more beers and finished the bag. As it turned out, big mistake.

Day three I woke up feeling like a rock a rock in my stomach. During the day the rock grew knives and by mid afternoon I was bedridden, groaning in pain with each breath.

I took some pain killers and tried to rest. It must just be a bug, how much longer could this go on?‚Äù I thought. 

By midnight I was desperate and exhausted. I was having trouble breathing and basically just crying with pain and exhaustion. We have 2 small children sleeping and a can‚Äôt possibly drive myself to hospital so I called an ambulance. I managed to stand and met them at the door. I nearly passed out from the effort so they led me back to the bedroom. As I sat, one experienced ambulance officer saw the look in my eyes and instinctively reached for a bin in the corner, just in time for me to projectile vomit. I‚Äôd never felt so ill in all my life.

After some tests they eventually decided to take me in for observation. After strong pain meds I finally got a few hours sleep and was discharged early the same morning. I got home and slept for about 10hrs straight. In the end I chalked it up to food poisoning. 

Fast forward a few months, mentioned the story to a friend who‚Äôs a dietitian. ‚ÄúWhat kind of nuts were they?‚Äù She asked. ‚ÄúBrazil nuts. Why‚Äôs that?‚Äù I replied. It turns out Brazil nuts have a very high concentration of selenium. Even just a handful can make you sick. If you eat enough you could actually suffer terrible side effects like brain damage, hair loss, liver malfunction or even death. She said I was probably lucky to get off without more lasting damage after eating so many.

Our only bathroom is on the second floor of our home, and the stairs are blocked by a baby gate (we have another 1 year old son who thinks injuring himself is hilarious, or something), so he put a small training potty on the linoleum at the bottom of the stairs. He has gotten really good at handling his business on his own and only calling for help if he really needs it, or a wipe. As such, sometimes my wife and I are unaware that he has gone #1 in his training potty. 

Such was the scenario that occurred not 10 minutes ago. I was going upstairs, noticed his potty had some pee in it, so I took the bowl upstairs to empty, leaving the seat downstairs. When I go to the bathroom, I noticed a light in the vanity had burned out, so I went to the basement to get a replacement. I replaced the bulb, and took the burned out one to the trash. Satisfied with my bit of handyman-ing, I sat down in my office to check my last few emails and log off for the evening. 

That‚Äôs when I heard it. 

My loving son cried out in confusion and fear. 

My wife screams in disbelief. 

I looked over at the potty bowl, still on the edge of the bathtub where I left it to dry after I washed it out. 

I knew what had happened, but I didn‚Äôt want to accept it. 

I went down the steps, and before me was an abomination that, if an image of it existed, would be used as evidence of a violation of the Geneva convention. 

Somehow, my three year old had manifested a poo that rivaled even the most foul I had ever produced. Think of the first poo of the day after a long night of drinking, followed up by reheated Taco Bell at 4am, and topped off with beef jerky.  

I was paralyzed in disbelief and shame. In any other circumstance, I would have been impressed. But now, staring at this massive dump on my living room floor, I began to question humanity itself. 

I scrubbed like have never scrubbed before, hoping to erase this shame, while my son berated me for my negligence. Truth be told, I deserved it. 

My house is going to smell like Clorox for a month, a constant reminder of how your life can change in a matter of seconds.  Let this be a warning to you all.

I‚Äôm sure a lot of people has heard of TouchTunes, it‚Äôs a jukebox app that most bars use now that allows the patrons to pay 50 cents or a $1 to play a song, and the song goes into a queue to be played in the order it was received. Some bars can set different settings only allowing one or two requests from the same person at a time, some have queue limitations, and so on and so forth. 

Well, the bar in my town has basically no limitations and will not stop you from buying as many songs as you want, and the queue goes in order. I quickly figured this out and loaded $20 into the app, which only charged 50 cents per song. Naturally, I bought Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up 40 times and Rick Roll‚Äôd an entire bar filled with 100+ people to the point where a lot of people were leaving around the 4th or 5th time the song played. The bar owner was visibly getting pissed, and noticed I was the only one still rolling laughing by the 5th play-through and caught on to the fact that it was me who played the song and told me I could never come back.

t3_klz4mc,TIFU by slamming on my brother's good nature and retroactively ruining a Christmas present," Now I'm not trying to excuse how I acted, but for context I want to say that I've been in a bit of a crappy place the past few weeks because my pup (Tayla) has been ill. Some kind of allergy causing her skin to become ultra sensitive and leading to a lot of irritation that has her almost chewing her own body apart. We were able to get her into a vet for some treatment and she's doing better now, but all we can do is treat the symptoms as the medicine to fix the cause of the problem is in the realm of a few grand, and me and my fiance recently had to self-isolate over Christmas because COVID doesn't discriminate.

We were finally able to see people today and he was one of the first to come around with some gifts of food and a bottle of wine, he stood outside the garden and we stood and talked about how Christmas was in the outside world, how we'd been coping locked away, how Tayla had been holding up. The works. Talking about everything shitty going on had me upset because I'm an emotional bitch when it comes to my pets. He moved on to talk about more positive things to lift the mood, like how most of the family never know what to buy him because his interests are outside of their norm so they mostly just gifted him money and a gag card or gift, and how he finally got a mic stand and HDMI matrix to make streaming more manageable. He only started around a month ago, and none of us were really taking it seriously, but me and a couple friends followed him to bump the numbers a bit.

By this point all the negativity of the past month or so just welled up in me and I snapped. I'm out here scraping together to afford treatment for my beloved pet while he's frivolously spending money on equipment too serious for something he talks about as a hobby? I told him it was a waste of money, and that it was probably a waste of time to stream in general since after a month he hasn't even broken double digits on his followers even though 4 of them are people he knows, so why even do it?

""Ah, honestly the reason is kinda childish and silly. When you told me about Tayla's condition and treatment costs I was kinda pissed internally that I couldn't do anything about it, then I saw a video from Cr1tikal where he talked about how his partner works as a vet and he sometimes funds treatment for owners who can manage alone. I thought it would be cool as fuck to be able to do, and since I'd otherwise be gaming in some of my spare time I may as well put myself out there to see if I can get lucky somehow. Besides, even if I only have a handful of real followers at least there's one or two people out there that I can entertain or make happy.""

The penny dropped and instantly I felt like shit. I knew he loved Tayla almost as much as I do, hell he was the one who accidentally named her when we first got her and I just completely ignored all that in my angst. All I could say was ""Oh. That's pretty cool actually"".

""Nah, it's dumb. I could probably spend my time doing something more constructive if I want money. Either way, my bank finally started letting people get finance again so I've applied for an account upgrade and credit card so I can build a better credit rating. At the end of the day I might at least be able to guarantor a loan so we can get her fixed up and happy! The matrix was a bit lavish, but it was a gift either way.

We pooled together to get you something more serious and less gifty, but we think you'd appreciate this more. Anyway, I've got to go do some editing and waste some more time streaming. I'll see you some time next week for a curry. Maybe on New Year's? Let me know when's best!""

And he just left laughing at his own joke like a dumbass. I sat in the garden with Tayla for a bit mulling over how much of an arsehole I'd been when my sister showed up. We talked for a bit, and she handed me a small box with a tag on it saying ""From everyone"". It was a prepaid debit card. She told me that after I got the news about Tayla our brother had the idea to have everyone in the family pool together to help with treatment. That if he had the numbers right it should be enough to cover 6 months of treatment until we can figure out a way to get the root cause fixed.

So now I'm sat on a late shift a few hours later wondering how our upbringing made one complete bastard and one of the most empathic and generous people I know.

tl;dr I angstily snapped at my brother and shat on his recent hobbies for not seeming to care enough about my dog's illness, but he spent a lot of time since finding out about it working out ways to help us afford treatment. I'm kind of a total prick.",7,11,tifu
t3_klz1kg,TIFU by giving the wrong card number to an Obamacare scammer,"Obligatory not today but rather earlier this month. This is kind of like a bittersweet tale of 2 fuck ups in one that cancel each other out, and I come away unscathed but having learned an important lesson about online security.

So, back before open enrollment started on Nov 1, I started looking for an estimate for Obamacare health insurance plans. I‚Äôm a broke full-time college student that lives on my own, and my step-dad lost his job in February (I didn‚Äôt know about the special life event enrollment period at that point). I googled ‚ÄúObamacare insurance quotes‚Äù, and I clicked on one of the first sites that came up. 

The website was like ‚Äúhey! Do you want a quick Obamacare quote?‚Äù I figured, why not, and plugged in my info. It was mostly stuff like my age, preexisting conditions, and annual taxable income. The site basically told me that if I applied for Obamacare, I‚Äôd have insurance plans available for about $60/month, with affordable co-pays and low-ish deductibles. I thought, ‚Äúokay, cool! I‚Äôll make sure to come back to this during open enrollment.‚Äù 

I have terrible ADHD &amp; executive dysfunction, and I procrastinated the application until the last day. So, on December 15th, I went to go fill out an application. I was not fully aware that all Obamacare proceedings are handled by marketplace.gov, and I clicked on the site from earlier because the link was still purple. I filled out my information again, and I was told to call a number on the screen. I did, and I was met with a lady named Jasmine who claimed to be from something like a ‚ÄúHealth Care Committee‚Äù. I asked if she was connected to the ACA, and she told me yes. 

Jasmine tells me about a plan that costs about $263/month for somewhat affordable co-pays, and it only has an emergency-room deductible. I start asking some questions, trying to explain my financial situation and how I couldn‚Äôt really afford the plan. She tells me she would need $493 that day, or I wouldn‚Äôt have health insurance. I politely tell her I didn‚Äôt have that much money to spare right now, and I hang up. 

Over the next half hour, I start receiving dozens of  calls from numbers all across the country. One calls me from the same number as the one I called earlier, and I pick up. It was a young guy, and he told me about a plan that would be $180/month, almost no-copays, and a $1000/deductible. I‚Äôd only need to pay $60 that night. I figured that was a way better deal than before, and I agreed to buy the product. 

He asks for my card number to pay the enrollment fee to ‚Äúreserve‚Äù my spot. I pull out a card, give him the number, and I keep the card in my hands just in case. He told me another agent would be in touch with some documents I need to sign. I speak with her, sign the documents while on the phone with her, and the call ends. 

Now for the ‚Äúfuck up‚Äù: As I put it back in my wallet, I realized I gave him the number to a card that currently has $0 in it (luckily, it didn‚Äôt have an overdraft option - the payment just wouldn‚Äôt go through). I tried calling them, but I was met with their out of office message. They email me about an hour later about this, and the email was incredibly fishy. It was like I suddenly noticed all of the red flags I missed and alarm bells were ringing in my head. I showed my partner, and they immediately noticed how obvious of a scam it was. I froze the card, applied for a new one, and I have kept that account empty. I even reported the number &amp; website to the FTC. 

So tl;dr: almost fell for a scam I should‚Äôve seen a mile away, but I didn‚Äôt because I am currently broke as fuck, and I accidentally gave them a card number to an account with $0 in it.",123,34,tifu

This happened a couple of hours ago.

I was eating lunch while my mom was watching the news today. The first piece of news we saw was that there was this new ""COVID-19 Version 2"" causing chaos in England, where people are desperately trying to leave the country. Well, I didn't know that it was a version 2 of COVID and asked my mom what the news was telling us. She explained that there was this new ""COVID-19 Version 2"" and that it is stronger than the current COVID-19 we have. Now, I am all for dark humor, it is my favorite. I started laughing hysterically in front of my mom because I was laughing at the fact that 2021 will be worse and that we would be in online school, quarantining, and not socializing for another year, maybe even longer. Yeah, after a couple of seconds,  I could see the terror in her eyes and telling me that this is not something to be laughed at. I am truly sorry, and I indeed fucked up today. (Mildy though)

t3_klyp5u,TIFU by 'blowing up' the theatre during a production.,"This happened quite a few years ago, but after the year we've all had I thought you might appreciate a funny story.

I was a second year drama student at Birmingham Uni and had to take my sound and lighting assessment which wasn't my strong point. I was assigned to work on the major production of the year which was Ibsen's *Peer Gynt* directed by a member of staff rather than the students, so it was quite a big deal. It involved a load of sound and lighting effects including a live string quartet, Grieg's musical score and lots of sound effects on a reel-to-reel tape recorder.

My job was to operate the tape recorder up in the sound box at the back of the auditorium and I had a copy of the script with all the sound queues marked on it. All I had to do was queue up each effect, press start/stop and use the faders on the desk if necessary, while my friend  did everything else because she knew what she was doing. It was quite complex but everything went smoothly in rehearsals...until press night.

Press night was a big deal. There was an invited audience of journalists, lecturers and other university big wigs plus all the director's friends and family. The pressure was on and we were all feeling it. Everyone backstage had headsets on so we could communicate. The first half went well - until the last scene before the interval. In this scene Peer Gynt comes home from his travels to find his mother on her death bed. It was a long and emotional death bed scene and in the heat of the moment both actors were really going for it, milking it a bit more than normal with extended sighing and crying. Consequently the music that I was playing in the background started to fade out before the end of the scene. So naturally I compensated by slowly pushing up the faders..to the max. The scene ended and it was brilliant. Peer Gynt's mother is dead, he's crying, we're all crying and sharing a moment of epic theatre. Except that I forgot to press stop on the tape recorder.

The next sound effect was an ocean liner blowing up in the mid Atlantic. It was the loudest explosion you've ever heard! Peer Gynt's mother fell off the bed. Everyone in the auditorium below the sound box jumped out of their seats and all I could hear in my head set was panicked screaming - followed by the director racing up to the sound box taking the stairs three at a time. He was furious.

The only thing that saved me was the fact that everyone, including myself, was in helpless hysterics of laughter by the time he got up to us. I swear he would have killed me otherwise.

The final irony was that I passed my assessment, probably because I gave everyone a night they wouldn't forget. Did I go on to work in the theatre? Er, no, although Peer Gynt did go on to star in Torchwood and Dr Who.

TL;DR  I ruined a theatre show by accidentally playing an explosive sound effect at max volume during a death scene and causing all the actors and audience to scream, duck and cover.

I had picked up a bottle of clicquot and wanted to celebrate this year being over. I popped it and gave about a 1/4 glass to my boyfriend as he‚Äôs not really the champagne type. I filled mine up. Now, since this bottle was $55 I didn‚Äôt want to waste it and decided to drink it all over the next couple hours. Little did I know how acidic champagne is and how it can ruin your stomach.

It‚Äôs midnight and I feel great after finishing the bottle. I slide in my sheets and prepare for a good nights rest.

I awake around 3am, stomach churning and in immeasurable amounts of pain. I just knew I needed to get this out of me and run to the toilet and force myself to barf. About 5 minutes later my stomach is probably 70% empty. But then I realize my entire throat, teeth, mouth, and fingers are all burning like I just dipped them into a vat of acid. It was horrendous burning pain. I probably threw up the equivalent of drain cleaner. Still don‚Äôt feel any better.

Back to sleep. I repeat this another three times throughout the night with the last two times being nothing but water (felt much better than the battery acid in my stomach).

Morning comes and my stomach still hurts. I feel nauseous and mildly hungover. Feels like anything I eat my body wants rid of.

Tldr: drank almost entire bottle of champagne, turned into battery acid in my stomach, threw up a bunch, burned my throat, mouth and hands, still in pain.

I used that camera on every gig until this year, I did like one last gig and then the qurantine was imposed, meaning the camera sat in it's bag in the corner of my room for months, with the last pre-covid gig still on the card because i had a strange workflow.

Then some months later there was some rare moon event, so i got the 1D and the telephoto lens out of it's bag and couldn't really get a good shot, tried some other lenses including a telescope and still couldn't get a clear shot (my lens has a problem where it can't get sharp images at infinity, and i later learned the telescope had a problem where it couldn't focus to infinity) so i gave up and put it away.

Come a month or two ago i decided to try some macro with a cheap close up filter i got, i pull the camera out of the bag and i notice it's already on, it couldn't even blink the access lamp.

After charging the battery for several hours, i turn it on and it's in full manual mode and the last picture on the card was a blurry picture of the moon.

Annnd it's not the first time i've done it, when i first got it i also left it turned on for months, except that still had charge to show the battery dead symbol.

Luckily it still works but i have to kick that habit because it will kill the battery and those batteries aren't cheap.

TL;DR: Left my camera switched on for most of the qurantine because i forgot how to use it and had to photograph the moon, only to discover my lens had a problem where it can't get sharp pictures of the moon, then to discover it was fully dead a few months later",21,0,tifu

Ok, so i dont know if any of you have done this as kids but basically, if you put glue on your hands and peel it off when it dries it feels EXTREMELY satisfying. I'm serious, try it out if you havent. So i suddenly remember this incredible fact mid stream. I have the incredible idea to go buy some glue right now and peel it off on stream as a fun joke. 

FUCKUP#1:I really mess up my room as im looking for my jacket, mask and wallet.(My stream is still on so im feeling really airheaded) I have this letter my wonderful girlfriend wrote to me on my sidetable and i apparently knocked that off in my rush to head outside.

Well online class finished early so I head on to the kitchen, turn on the stove, and lower the heat a bit and go back to my room..
Time passes for idk how much long and I go back to the kitchen. I notice there is lot of smoke coming out of the pan and I knew I left it for too long, our stove also has a tendency to raise the heat on its own.. I lift up the pan and booom fire!!
I was scared shocked and I had no idea what to do.. I knew water was a no go from all the videos I watched online of all the failures, I remembered dirt or sand but I had neither, I had no fire extinguisher.. I tried putting it down with a cloth but to no avail.. All I had left was ask for help and no one was home other than my mother's nosy aunt who lives with us, that I was not on speaking terms with... She came, picked up the pan and went outside on the balcony and somehow the fire died down?? Maybe it was the wind or it came in contact with outside air idk..

t3_kllgtn,TIFU by leaving my bra at my boyfriend‚Äôs place,"This did not happen today but I die a little inside everytime I think about it.

I met my (then) boyfriend during school. We each had our own apartment but spent all of our time together.  We were basically living together but kept the appearances of having separate places because we both have very traditional parents (like the no sex before marriage, all s/os are introduced as ‚Äúfriends from school‚Äù type of traditional).

For the next 2-3 years we kept up the ruse and would migrate our stuff back to our own place whenever our parents would visit.  It all worked out fine.  Fast forward to graduation, both our families came to the graduation.  At this point, I‚Äôve not met his parents but they had extended an invite to my family and me to have a meal after the graduation ceremony.  It all went fairly well. 

After graduation, his parents decided to help him move back home while he looked for a new place.  So before they came, I looked around the apartment and cleared out my stuff.... or so I thought.

The bf and his dad were moving the bed together and when they finally slid it away from the wall, the bra fell onto the floor. It was lodged in the crevice between the bed and the wall.  My bf said everything started going into slow motion and he knew it was too late to try to recover.  His dad picked up the bra and threw it at him. Awkwardness ensued and they finished the rest of the move in silence.

Anyway, his dad must have told his mom because he got a call later that day and was given a stern talking to about being at school for ‚Äústudying purposes‚Äù and not to ‚Äúmake any mistake‚Äù he would regret.

We are married now but I am pretty sure they knew the bra was mine and probably thought I‚Äôm a sex fiend who stole their boy‚Äôs innocence.  I‚Äôm just glad they never mentioned that incident at a family dinner with my parents.  That would be a different kind of hell.

t3_klrnet,TIFU by deleting an entire essay," I thought this was the perfect place to share this (one of my biggest fuck ups). So this was back when I (15M) was in fifth grade. I was 11 at the time, and hated school. I did poorly because it was hard to pay attention. My parents knew this and kept holding me responsible for my grades. So I was a special ED student. But, I also tended to do a ton of pranks. When my sibling was walking by a corner, I would jump scare him. When somebody was about to walk into a dark room, I would leave a fake cockroach to scare them. I had a ton of pranks up my sleeve. So I tended to be mischievous most of the time.

Anyways, During the last 2 months of school, we had to complete a TDA (Text-Dependent-Analysis) as a group assignment. I was grouped with the top 5 people in a regular class. I had a tendency to suck at essays so I spent most of the time just re-reading paragraphs. It wasn't boring, but it sure wasn't a good way to pass time. But I remembered that all I had to do was sit there doing nothing and just read some sentences if called. Another thing to keep note is that this was on a google doc (not Microsoft word.)

So with all this free time, I was playing games on the school computers. I only got called 4 times each day so there wasn't much disturbance. But I still got insanely bored for some reason. So I came up with the idea to pull a prank. I did all the time at home so what would be the trouble if I did at school? I knew this was a perfect way to get a good laugh out of.

This is where the fuck up begins. I copied the entire doc using ctrl + A then ctrl + X. (For those of you that don't know what this does, it selects the entire document, then deletes it while also copying it at the same time). After everybody in the group realized the document was gone, the group was driven insane because I ""accidently"" deleted the entire TDA. It was funny until somebody random in the group decided to turn off the computers using the power cord connected to the outlet so it wouldn't save. It did the exact opposite. Everything was my fault so I told everybody in the group that I copied the entire doc and all we had to do was press ctrl + V. The group had to rewrite the entire essay and I was put into detention.

It's sad since I now know you can restore the document if it got deleted on google doc. Now I cringe whenever I think back to this. But, at least I am much better at writing and reading now.

This story occurred pre-corona but just came up again the other day so I thought I‚Äôd post here. 

A few friends and I were at a bar downtown when I struck up a conversation with a random girl about what I was drinking. We started chatting and I asked for her name. Now, the music was blasting so when she told me her name I heard her say, DA MEAT. I even asked her to repeat it, probably four or five times, and even asked if she meant DENISE (or maybe she was Turkish or something?). I did my due diligence. But nope, DA MEAT.

Now when I got back to my friend group, my one friend seemed interested and asked if I got her name. So I told him, and he went over to chat her up. Now with the music being so loud he essentially had to whisper/speak directly into her ear, and of course the first thing he said was ‚ÄúDA MEAT,‚Äù thinking it was her name.

So from this girl‚Äôs perspective, a strange man came to her and half yelled ‚Äúthe meat‚Äù into her ear. 

Of course that wasn‚Äôt actually her name (what her name really was is lost to the drunken void of that night) but it certainly wasn‚Äôt what I thought it was. 

From there, drinks were spilled, boys were bounced, and the legend of DA MEAT lives on as a story that gets told at every single gathering where alcohol is involved (so every single one).

t3_kloncu,TIFU by drinking eggnog,"This happened a couple years ago at Thanksgiving, but every year around the holidays eggnog comes back around and I remember this story. 

My mom and I have been (apart from this year) visiting her family in the Midwest for the holidays for many years, and this year, we brought an international student from my college to join us for an old-fashioned American Thanksgiving. As we were in charge of making homemade eggnog that morning, we thought we‚Äôd show him how to do it. We mixed up all of the ingredients as our family recipe says to do it, and then my mom poured the eggnog into a thermos and put it into the fridge. 

A few hours later, the whole family gets together for our Thanksgiving dinner (at around 1 PM, of course), and I wind up pouring myself glass after glass of the eggnog. Over the course of the afternoon and evening, I easily had well over a quart (almost two thirds) of that batch. That evening, we returned to my uncle‚Äôs house where we were all staying and went to bed. 

Have you ever woken up in the middle of the night and just known something was off? My eyes shot open at around midnight, and I thought I felt fine, but over the course of a couple of minutes, my stomach began to churn. I immediately ran to the bathroom, threw open the toilet seat, and began to violently vomit this repulsively eggy liquid. Homemade eggnog is just as bad on the way back up as it is good on the way down. Once I was finished, I felt better, drank a glass of water, and went back to sleep. 

An hour later, my eyes shot open again. Oh no, I think to myself. Not again. But yep, round 2 was approaching. I‚Äôll spare the most gruesome of the details, but this process repeated itself every hour, almost on the hour, for the rest of the night and into the mid-morning. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen my mom more frightened for my safety, yet I still can‚Äôt blame my college buddy for laughing his ass off about it every time my loud hurling woke him up. To this day, we haven‚Äôt made homemade eggnog ever since - store-bought isn‚Äôt quite the same, but I‚Äôm definitely going to need a while before I can warm up to the idea of risking getting violently ill again.

Cuz well she can't drive. Because she barely uses the car she's always paranoid about it. so... whenever we get to a petrol station (Garage (I'm south African)) she asks the employees to check the oil and water levels.

Your told to pop open the trunk and they open the hot coolant container cap and let all that steam leave. Fill the container with water and tell you to get coolant if your low.

Now little did I know. You should never do this with modern cars. Ours is a 2015 Chevrolet Cruze.

So as a result the coolant container was empty. So I bought some like as fast as I could. It was Christmas eve and I knew we had to travel like 2 hours to go see family the next day. 

The next morning everybody is rushing. So I ecide I should quickly put the coolant in. I open the cap fill it to the recommended max then I switch on the car (for the coolant to suck it in) I check again and everything is good.

But just before I finish coolant cap still off mom starts shouting for me. So then like an idiot I quickly close the hood coolant cap still lying on its container. 5 minutes later, we're moving

About a minute or two into the drive we stop at a light. I see steam near the hood. I look at my brother and he doesn't say anything. I can't see properly outside so I think maybe it's one of the 5 taxis (mini bus taxis are not famous for being in good condition) around us. I think they are blowing the steam onto the car not a big deal.

But I'm still panicking and I think did I close it. I don't remember closing it but I close a lot of things without remembering closing them.look them.look ft 0 8
It's at this point I should've told my brother to stop the car. Because as you know, I didn't close the cap.

For 10 whole minutes I tell myself ""it's fine"" over and over again. While I suspiciously check the temp gauge which is normal. 
Then a code warning flashes. Then I realise it's not fine. 

So I start hintingl like ""hey let's go to a garage or something real quick I need to do something.""

But then the engine starts making a knocking sound. Then he says the car can't accelerate as much as it could as he repeatedly floors the Accelerate pedal. 

So he stops the car and low and behold the Coolant Container Cap is ontop of the container and there is absolutely no coolant in the Container again. (how it didn't fall off surprises me. 

An hour later in the beside the freeway. We fill the car up with Coolant and it all starts leaking everywhere.  

My brother thinks that if we can get to a safe place before the leaking is done it would be better. So tries to start the car and nothing. It just wheezes. Eventually the batter dies and now the car is just dead. 

2 hours later on Christmas day that car is towed back home. No food prepped and Christmas ruined. Thanks to me.

My family's home business used to be run by my mother but because she has early onset Alzheimer's she can't run a business. Our business? A boarding cattery. We're paid to look after cats while their owners are away. This Christmas season has been abysmal because of the pandemic. 

A lovely family brought their cat in yesterday. A wife, her mother and her two kids. The cat is a beautiful long haired white cat with grey tabby markings. He's a sweetheart. Usually cats come to a cattery for the first time and hide in the most closed off part of the cage because they're scared. Not this guy. Waltzed out of his carrier and proceeded to park off. The kids are crying. They already miss their baby. The mom is worried sick because her baby is a fussy eater. I assure her that we deal with fussy eaters all the time and not to worry. Then as they are leaving the grandmother asks me ""Promise he'll be safe"" and I did.

So every cage exists in a double door system. It shouldn't be possible for them to get out... If you latch the cages properly. While assuring the owners that their cat was in safe hands I forgot to latch the bottom latch. The night goes on, I close the door to the cages (Surprise surprise not securely) and I go to bed. I wake up in the morning ready to clean up the cages and console lonely cats. I get to our new guest's cage and he's gone. He squeezed out the bottom of the cage and then pushed his way out of the door.

You know that feeling where your stomach falls out your butt and everything comes in to sharp focus and you just can't believe what's happening? Yeah. That. I lifted his blanket hoping for a second that magic exists and that he'll appear underneath it but no. This cat is long gone. I have to call that lovely family and let them know that their cat has escaped. I'm begging to any God that will listen for this cat to come back.

I love cats and I know what it feels like to go to bed in a house with a beloved cat and then wake up to a house without them. I know the trauma and the deep depression that comes with losing a pet. So I know that if I left my cat in the care of another person and they lost them I would curse them with every fibre of my being. I deserve that. This business supports my family and I and I may have just ruined it in a time where we're already struggling to keep it going. 

This is the shart on top of the rot cake of 2020.

tl;dr: I am paid to look after peoples' cats and I lost a client's cat by sheer negligence.",6,11,tifu
t3_klm6ft,TIFU by translating word to word from one language to another,"Obligatory not happened today but few years ago. My mother tongue is Telugu (A South Indian language). My second language is English and Hindi my third(not as fluent).

In college, I gave audition for a play. It was a simple audition where you have to speak in Hindi in front of 100 other students until the judges say to stop.

 It was my turn and it was going okay. I said about myself, about my city, etc. I was running out of things to say. The judges didn't say stop. So my brilliant mind came up with this idea to talk about my roommate who was also at the audition in the audience. So I pointed at him and started saying things about him. This is where I fucked up.

Telugu and English doesn't have the concept of gender, but Hindi does. In English, everything other than a male or female person has a neutral gender. The pronoun will be 'it'. In Telugu , everything other than a male person has a female gender. The pronoun will be 'she'. In Hindi, everything has a gender and is assigned arbitrarily. A bus is female but a car is male.

Naturally I didn't have the concept of gender in languages, since the languages I am fluent don't have it. So word to word translation from Telugu to English and vice versa works well but not to Hindi. 

English: The dog(it) is running.

Telugu: The dog(she) is running(female). 

Hindi: The dog(he) is running(female). 

So, I pointed at my roommate who is a guy and used the female gender markers because that is the default in my mother tongue. 

""My ( female ) roommate is a great guy. She is from Rajasthan."" As soon as I started speaking, everyone started laughing including the judges. I didn't understand why everyone was laughing but that did not stop me from speaking. The judges were having fun. They let me speak for 5 more minutes. 

This is how I learnt that there exists a concept of gender in languages.

TLDR: I fucked by getting confused with gender markers in front of everyone",39,5,tifu
t3_kllhox,"TIFU by buying, and losing, handcuffs","Obligatory this didnt happen today, but it happened a couple weeks ago.
So! I'm an adult. I just turned into one and let me tell you its awful liberating. That being said, I'm still in highschool and living with my parents (I dont graduate till May). However, this does, or at least did, not stop me from going to adult shops and doing adult things considering its legal and reasonable now, right?

Recently, my partner and i have been getting into more... Kinky things. We're both  generally sexually active/curious. So when i find a pair of fluffy handcuffs at a bargain shop for $3, why wouldnt i try it? Its a nice little gift for my partner and i to try out while we do stuff.

Unfortunately, id never get the chance.

I opened them after i bought them to just try them on, just to see what it was like; they were actually decent, considering it was an amazon backlog product that they just got rid of. After, I tossed them in the backseat of my car without a second thought, excited to try them out with my partner later on.

I cane home a bit later than i had hoped, so i quickly threw my shopping spree items into a bag and carried it all inside. I had some laundry in my car (a jacket i had spilled some icecream on) that is also threw in the bag, and in my rush to wash the jacket and show my mom all my spoils from earliers trip, i managed to lose the handcuffs. You can see the fuckup already.

Initially, i forgot i had bought them; i was focused on a lot more things i already bought. Occasionally it would cross my mind, but i chalked it up to me leaving it in my room somewhere and decided it wouldnt be extremely important to find it.
I really wish i had looked earlier, because as it turns out, my mother would be the one to find it.

About a week after i bought it, she found it, but worse yet, my dad caught a glimpse of it, so they both knew that someone brought a pair of fuzzy cuffs in the house and they had their suspicions. 
Lucky me, my awesome sister called me before i went in, and warned me that it had been found, giving me a couple minutes to think of an excuse.

The worst part was confrontation. I sweat for a few minutes, racking my brain for any excuse i could think of when they finally asked. But nothing could prepare me for what was about to happen. 
When they asked about it, they were, of course, surprised and slightly apprehensive. I quickly jabbered out an excuse of buying it as a joke, putting it in my cart and not wanting to do the walk of shame to put it back when people were in line behind me. To my shock, they bought it without a hitch; but the catch? 
My father triumphantly states: ""as your punishment, your mom and i are gonna be using these for their intended purpose!!""
needless to say, I was a little fucking horrified. It was played off as a decent joke but finding those cuffs hanging on their dresser later wasnt very comforting. It was better than getting my ass beat though!

TLDR; I bought kinky handcuffs and my parents found them; dad announces not to come into their room that night and im definitely not getting those cuffs back.",16,3,tifu

My dumb ass decides to immediately fire back with ""the African child slaves might get out of my closet."" My teacher physically recoiled and the look of shock on her face was something to behold. After that, she told me to turn off my camera and class went on as normal.

A few hours later, after school had ended for the day, I got an email from the school administration, asking me to participate in a zoom conference about ""my highly inappropriate behavior towards Ms. Math Teacher."" At the conference, we discussed how ""some things are inappropriate to joke about in school."" I apologized profusely and sent an apology email to Ms. Math Teacher.

&amp;#x200B;

Enter Billy Mack from Love Actually -  *‚ÄúFuck wank bugger shittin' ass head and hole!‚Äù*

Instead of telling my mum straight away, I thought I would sit in silence and ponder what to do... I already felt guilty and stupid for even slapping the window, and thought my mum would just rage (fairly so) and make it worse....

&amp;#x200B;

I consulted my sister who told me to give her an ""I'll pay for it"" sandwich... kind of like a Compliment Sandwich - but with money. This was my initial thought, however, my brain being completely out of this world was like, nope, just blame a non-existent bird.

Well, guilty for breaking the window, lying and trying to blame a bird; ashamed for lying to begin with; and completely ridiculous that my first thought was to blame a bird, of course. Why did I decide to do this? No clue.

So now I have to pay to get the window fixed, look my mum in the eye after she knows I tried to lie, AND tell my dad when he gets home from work...

t3_kljxiv,"TIFU by ringing up a large lotto order wrong, and having to buy $100 worth of tickets","I work at a 7-11 in Virginia, and Lotto sales are pretty straightforward.  We have a console with a touch screen, and we either can do a random play by pressing a button for the number of plays (1-10) or if they want to select their own numbers. or otherwise do a special play, like multiple draws on the same number,  we can select that menu.

Today, a gentleman came in, said he wanted to buy $100 of Powerball tickets for his brother.

I had never done a sale of that size before, so when I pulled up the Powerball menu, I selected 5 draws on 10 panels, thinking this was going to print out 10 tickets with 5 plays on each of them (the tickets are $2 a piece).  When I sent the sale, the machine spits out 1 ticket, with 10 numbers being played 5 times each  What I had actually sent to the lotto machine was 5 draws for the set of 10 numbers.  In other words, the ticket was good for the next 5 power ball drawings, using those numbers.

Of course, the customer refused the sale, so I had to do it again, with the help of my exasperated, but ever so patient co-worker, this time hitting the $20 easy play button 5 times to get him what he had asked for. which was 50 numbers for the next drawing.

The big problem is that Powerball tickets cannot be refunded, and no one was going to buy a $100 ticket like this one, because most people don't play multiple draws.  I knew I was screwed, and I'm guessing that I would have to eat the $100.  So, I felt that I had to do the right thing, and spent $100 I don't have to buy the damn ticket, and now here I am, hoping to God that one or two of these damned numbers will hit over the next month, so I can make my money back.

TL:DR Customer wanted 50 plays on the next Power Ball drawing, I sold him 10 plays on the next 5, and had to eat the $100.",15,7,tifu

I was at a youth group (church kids group) event, and we were waiting for the last few kids to show up in a group of ~20, waiting in the lobby area of the church. I had recently gotten a PlayStation Portable, and loved every second I got to play it. I was making good progress on Daxter, and thought this would be a good time to keep that progress going. 

My youth group leader was cool, but always wanted everyone to be engaged and interactive, so when he saw me playing on my fancy technology by myself, he immediately said some snarky line about ‚Äúyou can only play with that if everyone can play at the same time.‚Äù 

Now, when someone gets snarky with me, I look for any opportunity to prove them wrong. In this case, I thought I‚Äôd showcase just how versatile this new tech was by showing off how it has a ton of music on it too. The future is now, old man! I said some line that I thought was witty at the time, then strolled over and plugged the church speakers right on into my PSP headphone jack so I could make my point. 

At this point, I should mention that at this age, I was becoming aware of pornography, beginning with a girls gone wild video of a girl licking another girls tit and spiraling downward from there. My shiny new PSP offered a perfect access portal to all this new content through its web browser, and I took every opportunity to explore it. One of those opportunities was the morning before I went to that youth group meeting. I‚Äôm guessing you see where this is going. 

Jump back to me plugging my PSP into the church speakers. I‚Äôm a little hazy as to whether I pressed play, or if it auto played from the source that played most recently, but either way, me and all the rest of the god-fearing congregation were very disappointed to hear moans, ‚Äúoh yeah‚Äùs, and a series of squelches come out of the loudspeakers before I managed to switch over to an actual song. That was actually part of the FU is that I thought I‚Äôd be able to play it off better if I didn‚Äôt just yank out the cord. 

I said something about those noises being part of some song, then slowly walked away with a beet red face and ‚ÄúAmerican Idiot‚Äù playing in the background. I received several pointed sermons in the following weeks and could never look the adults from the congregation in the eye ever again. My family ended up switching to a different church because of all of the stern talks they were getting about how to raise their kid properly.

I‚Äôm responsible for two of the locations closest to me and also cover 3 locations within an hour radius of my main location. 

Just to give you a little background: my job requires to me to be ready to go by being on call at night for pick-ups and working basically 6-7 days a week. I‚Äôm supposed to have 2 days off a week since I‚Äôm an intern but that hasn‚Äôt happened since we lost our licensed funeral director at my main location and I have been covering. I also have started an online class  so I can get my education in order to become a licensed funeral director. The class is bio which is fucking hard after being out of school for a while. 

So it‚Äôs 7pm and I‚Äôm chilling. I just got out of my bra and was ready to conquer the night and take my biology test. I get a text notification and look down to see a text from my boss saying ‚Äútake the hearse to (northern location an hour away) and be there for 8:30 funeral‚Äù immediately my brain remembers him telling me he might need to come up for a funeral today so I don‚Äôt even think and put my bra back on (it was still sweaty and awful) and book it out the door to get there in time. My boyfriend even panic helped me by making me coffee to go and packing my dinner in the fridge. 

I make it to my main location in record time to grab my hearse and also a bag of Chex mix that I had stashed in case of emergency to munch on. I even had time to get gas! A feat!

I had to take the hearse on the turnpike which I had never done before and scared me because that bitch is looooong. Although most of the ride I was impressed by all the fancy features that it had such as automatic high beams (woah) and pressure sensitive blinkers to indicate a lane change of a full turn (annoying). 

So I finally pull up to the northern location at 8:30 pm (chefs kiss) to find it completely dark and an empty parking lot. No one was there. He meant 8:30 AM not PM (face palm)


Never did I stop to think- did he mean tomorrow? For some reason a 8:30 PM funeral made total sense to me. I thought, hey maybe it‚Äôs a 6-9pm viewing and a late mass idk‚Äù

I quickly text my boyfriend to tell him of my immaculate dumb bitch fuck up and I realize I clocked in. We clock in on our phones so I hastily clocked out but now I have to tell my boss to take that shift off because of what I did.

t3_klgm04,TIFU by installing a bidet in my mothers bathroom.,"So I actually installed the bidet about two years ago, but it only came back to bite me in the ass (proverbially) today. 

A few years back my BF and I purchased one of those bidet attachments off of Amazon, and were delighted. So much in fact, that I bought one for my mom, and installed it for her when we visited. While she scoffed at the time, she admits it came quite in handy when covid hit and toilet paper was scarce. 

A side note, these things are powerful. A fun thing to do when giving a tour of my place is to position the guest across from my toilet with a towel held up and crank that shit. 10/10 with the shock and awe, I feel like Tony Stark showing off the Jericho missiles. 

ALSO: the versions we have are not the deluxe versions with warm water. It is a brisk and refreshing way to wake up in the morning if you‚Äôre expecting it, but a brutal and icy violation in ones most vulnerable spot for the uninitiated....

Which brings us back to the incident. While I live a little over 1200 miles away, Mom lives in the same town as my little sister, and in fact moved there to take up grandmotherly duties for my sister‚Äôs two wee ones. 

Like today, the neiflings were over at Nana‚Äôs house for Christmas cookie baking and such, when my niece needed to use the facilities. Niece is a little over two, and in the potty training stage....sis didn‚Äôt have the child‚Äôs seat, so she instructed kiddo to balance carefully and left her to her business...

I think you can guess what happened next

My sis and mom said they heard a shriek of utter terror and distress, and ran back to the bathroom to see what had happened. There‚Äôs niece, huddled inconsolable and howling in the farthest possible corner from the toilet with the bidet at full blast. 

TL;DR, maybe she was curious about the buttons, maybe she just lost her balance, but because I installed a bidet in my mothers bathroom, I may have traumatized my toddler niece for life, and possibly set her potty training progress back by a few decades...",182,20,tifu
t3_klgcsj,TIFU by having a really good study session,"Just got off the phone with my parents after assuring them that I'm very much not dead. 

For some context, I'm an actuarial science major currently studying for my next actuarial exam, which means hours upon hours of practice math problems. My exam date is in a little less than a month, so I'm really feeling the pressure since these puppies are *tough* tests. I had a bad study day yesterday (my mind was in a funk) so I barely got any study time in, much less any studying of quality. I went to bed resolving to do much better today - and *boy did I!*

I had the best study day of my life. No exaggeration. Burned through 6 whole units, and a handful of practice quizzes with high marks. I felt more focused than I've been in recent memory and I largely attribute this to putting my phone on silent and chucking it in my desk drawer. Without that distraction I was able to stay on track for much longer than usual, and I started to get optimistic that I could keep this trend up the rest of the month if I just started a habit of keeping my phone away. I had just resolved to repeat this process tomorrow when I got interrupted by a knock on my door.

I'm living in my university's dorms over break because it's a good study environment, what with it being so empty and quiet over the holidays. The school makes a couple RA's stay over break too just in case there's situations with whatever students stay behind, and they keep a cell phone you can call in case of emergency. Well, seeing as my phone was put away and unchecked since about 8 am, I hadn't responded to a single text, call, or snap, so my parents resorted to calling my RA when they didn't hear from me. 

*They assumed I was fucking dead.* 

I answered the door to my RA shaking in his boots because he expected the worst since my parents sounded extremely panicked explaining the situation over the phone. I explained to him I was perfectly fine, not in distress, just studying hard. Of course, when I pulled my phone out of the drawer I had 10 missed calls, about two dozen texts, and even an email - my mom resorted to sending me an email with the subject line ""**PLEASE CALL ME!!!**"" I had to sheepishly explain to my parents (who were about ready to hop in the car and drive the 2 hours to come to my dorm) that I wasn't in the middle of a nervous breakdown but instead just had my phone in my desk. 

My mom has since calmed down but I still feel incredibly stupid for making multiple people think I was dead/potentially dying. I was just doing math!

**TLDR; I put my phone on silent and in a drawer so I could focus on doing math all day, parents assumed I killed myself and called a wellness check on me.**",56,14,tifu
t3_klffn8,TIFU. I gave my wife a crappy day.,"""TIFU"" This happened today. I am a over the road truck driver and subsequently have missed many holidays at home because I'm on the road 2-3 weeks at a time. Not this year, I got home the afternoon before Christmas Eve and have enjoyed being home with my wife and daughter.

This morning I had to get on the road again, alarm set for 5:00 am. Our old dog decided he needed to go potty at 4:00 am. Let him out and continue to pack and get ready in a slightly zombie esque state. Kissed my sleeping wife and daughter and left.

On the way out I smelt a dog poo aroma, and figured our old dog had let some gas out before I let him out. I was so wrong...

About 4 hours later my wife calls wondering where our daughters bike was. I told her it is probably in the back of my pickup after picking them up from bike riding yesterday before dinner. She responded with yelling ""Okay, G*dammit"" and hung up.

I texted her half hour later when I stopped for fuel. Also because I know better than to call back in that situation immediately, (being married for 17 years you learn some things) "" It was an accident, I didn't mean to forget and apparently ruin ur day. Sorry""

Her response was "" No I‚Äôm mad because I stepped in dog shit and I didn‚Äôt realize it and I tracked it over the whole fucking basement""

Apparently in my zombie half asleep state, I had completely missed stepping in a giant pile of poop that one of our dogs had left in the basement. I feel horrible because I'm gone for at least two weeks, but when I called her we couldn't stop laughing.

TLDR: I missed stepping in a shit show by being half asleep, and wife got right in the middle of it wide awake.

No outside damage meaning screen and back is perfect showed it and then we went to math class where before I turned off my phone. After math class I turned it on took forever to boot which is a symptom of loop disease. Then later on I found out the mic has died on the phone and the calling has also died too. Though ios updates did fix one of the problems where it can finally turn on quicker and bluetooth headphones would let the phone be able to call again but you need to put on the headphones everytime someone called you.

t3_klev1f,TIFU Throwing away my friends ashes from their grandmother on Christmas,"It took me a lotttt of courage to want to post this.
A LOT

So, I went over to my friends house on Christmas Eve because we‚Äôve had this tradition for ten years to go back and fourth celebrating Christmas at each others houses. Apparently he let his nephew rent a room out and he kicked him out two days ago because he kept messing up the house completely, and was very irresponsible overall.

I agreed to help clean the place up before his family and a few of our friends came over tomorrow. I mainly swept,vacuumed, and dusted ( and threw out some empty alchohol bottles + taking out some garbage )

The house looked nice, smelled clean, and we were both proud of ourselves for cleaning so damn good.
We ended up going to sleep not long after and woke up the next day around 6 AM to get prepared for everything.

While I was searching for some eggnog to set out for everyone to drink, I came across an empty bottle of vodka hidden behind some bottles in the fridge that seemed to be filled with something that looked like cigarette ash.
I obviously threw it away because in my mind, why would I keep an empty bottle of vodka filled with the remains of a cigarette?

Hours went by and people started arriving. We sat down, had a nice dinner, spoke about our favorite time about the holidays etc. My friend got up and went to his room telling us to wait there for a second and that he‚Äôd be right back.

Some of us were wondering what he was getting. Most of us thinking it was some secret Santa event or a gift and so on. We pretty much just continued our conversation until we heard him freaking out in another room. First, most of us looked around pretty shocked. I decided to get up and go check things out, telling everyone else at the dinner table to give me a minute.

I entered the room and I saw most of his objects on the ground and his bed sheets ripped off. I was really shocked and asked him what was wrong, he then replied telling me that his grandmothers ashes were gone.

He used to keep them in a vase but he recently put them in a necklace that he found out was owned by his grandma before she passed on. I started lookin  around with him until I remembered the vodka bottle.

That was just cigarette ash, right? No way that‚Äôd be anything but that? Why would they be in there? 

He told me he thought his nephew had stole it until I looked under his bed and found the necklace, empty of any ash.

I immediately started freaking out and told him what I threw away earlier and he ran out the room and into the kitchen, digging into the garbage cans and not caring what anyone at the table who were there thought. I came out as well and awkwardly started digging through the cans too. I could sense everyone was uncomfortable by the energy going through the house.

Luckily, he got the bottle.

Unluckily, the ashes had fallen out of it when it was thrown away.

In the end I went home because I felt terrible and I could tell my friend was very hurt inside.

I‚Äôm pretty sure his drunk nephew put the ashes in the bottle.


I messaged him yesterday and he has yet to respond so I feel like he hates me now.


TL;DR: went over on Christmas Eve, helped cleaned up after his irresponsible nephew was kicked out, found a vodka bottle filled with what I thought was cigarette ashes and threw it away. Friend found out ashes were missing, me and him dug through a garbage can in-front of people, I left out of guilt.",74,15,tifu
t3_klen7k,TIFU by waking up a customer on work experience,"This didn't happen today, but many years ago.  
I was 15 and doing work experience in a financial advisors company. My ""job"" was to call customers who were on the system, check that their details were still correct and update the system accordingly. I had a script for the phone calls (although most people just hung up on me).  
The company wasn't massive and was based in the UK, so most of the customers were in the UK as well.  
However, it turned out that at least one customer wasn't. I noticed that it was an international number (I had to dial each number individually) so I probably should've anticipated what happened next, but I just didn't. I think the conversation played out approximately like this:  
Me : Good morning, I'm calling from *(company name).* Is this Mr *(customer's name)*?  
Him: *(sounding very sleepy)* Yes. What time is it?  
Me: Just past 11, sir  
Him: Where are you calling from?  
Me: *(company name),* your financial advisors, sir  
Him: I mean what country?  
Me: Um....England  
Him: Well I'm in Chicago, in the USA and it's 5am here, you just woke me up  
Me: Oh, sorry. I'll call back later   
I then hung up in panic. Despite telling him I'd call back, I never did as I was worried about annoying him further (and clearly his phone number was correct, which was the most important piece of information).   
The next day, he called the office (and got my supervisor) because he was wondering why I never called back and whether we still needed to update his details?  
Turns out, he was one of the company's biggest customers. Luckily, the company didn't lose him due to my ineptitude, but it was still not a great impression to make on work experience.

Honestly, I didn't 100% think I had covid but I wanted to be safe. Also, I had recently worked a lot of long shifts that requires to be on my feet all the time and my knees are awful. I enjoyed my little vacation. Tests come back negative, I go back to work and enjoy Christmas.

Well, I realize that I forgot to ask off my birthday and no one will take my shift. I've asked everyone and even offered to work half of it but still no takers. I can't call off because I'm pretty sure my manager is still a pissed off that I missed two days of work for no reason last week. 

I'm not even that mad about working on my birthday, it's that I don't want to reschedule a dentist appointment. I go back to college soon and my window of availability is closing quickly. Also, I'm pretty sure they'll charge a fee. I'm such an idiot. I never should've called off. I know now that it was just allergies but I just wanted an excuse to slack off.

t3_klduwk,TIFU when my cousin caught me doing the nasty.,"Alright, Christmas time, Christmas time oh my god its Christmas time.

Anyway. I jerk a bit, not always but at least 1 a week, I try.

I work a lot and week before Christmas was stressful. Didn't have time for anything. 

My cousin lives near me and my family. Her parents live in a different country Ireland and they wanted her to get a head start and try to find a job in the states etc etc. They all want to move to the states eventually. We normally invite her over once a week for dinner since she doesn't have anyone here except my family. Every other relative on my moms side lives in Ireland. Shes around my age, we are pretty close and she ain't bad looking either but that's besides the point.

So the other day everyone in my house was gone at work etc etc. They don't get off till like 6pm, I was off for the day and I was glad. I RARELY get a day where I have the house to myself for most of the day. I was sleeping in. Blasting my guitar when I'd normally have to play with headphones, I was eating junk. I made myself a bomb ass grilled cheese while sitting feet up on the couch, no pants, watching reruns of Shark Tank and Family Feud. Couldn't have asked for a better day. Then after eating I thought, I haven't jerked off in a while. With work and everything, I never had time. Was horny as hell because of that. I was going upstairs to my room to my laptop to get something good to watch and I thought. No ones here, why not just plug in my laptop to the living room TV. My living room TV is a 75 inch 4k compared to my 13.3 inch 1080 laptop. We also have a Sonos Beam sound bar. If you know Sonos, you know those are top of the line speakers. Blow your mind with the bass. My living room also has big windows with no blinds but our backyard is completely secluded, no one can see anything.

So it's around 4pm, I go to my living room and I plug in my laptop and find a good porn to watch. I play it kind of loud and I'm going to town. I have my towel on the floor so I can just pop it in the wash right after. After like 2 mins I'm about to blow. I normally last longer but I guess since I haven't done it in a while, it just came fast. I'm about to jiz and my cousin knocks on the door and immediately proceeds to open it. Guess it wasn't locked. Normally, my mom tells me when my cousin is coming over but this time, nope.

She opens the door and notices me, I turn around, she comes to realization and screams. ""WHAT THE FUCK!"" At this moment, I'm already jizzing and I'm a flyer. It's launches on to the flowers, floor, and couch all in front of me. I just stand there frozen for a few seconds not knowing whether to run up stairs or turn the TV off and start cleaning up my mess or force her to leave till I'm ready. I then realize, shit it's Christmas Eve, she coming over so we can go out to dinner when everyone gets back. Also that stores close early, so everyone may be coming back in like half hour. After working so much this week, I lost track of what day it was. So in a rush, I yank my laptop from the HDMI, run upstairs and put on pants and I start yelling in my head ""what do I do, what I do???"" 

I rush back down and I start to explain myself and she ain't having it. ""Ewwwwww, just stop TALKING and clean up your mess!"" 

I clean up as slowly as possible to avoid conversation with her. She's just sitting down at kitchen table with a face. You know that face. I'm done cleaning and I ask her, do you want to sit down on the couch. She just says ""uhhh. I'd rather not."" ""Don't worry, I cleaned it up."" ""Um. No thanks.""

It was awkward as hell. It was at least 20 minutes of silence till the rest of my family came. She surpisingly didn't tell anyone. Maybe her friends? I don't know. Hopefully not. But she tried to play it off all cool in front of my family. Christmas day she came over too but still weirded out. Haven't seen her since Christmas. She'll get over it hopefully.

What happened to you being excited for him to be in a relationship? Now your pissed at his girlfriend because he's happy?!

t3_klbd6u,TIFU By Telling my Dad I went off the pill,"
TLDR; Dad found out I went off the pill. Forgot the reason I was on it in the first place and proceeded to make me a power point presentation about family planning and It‚Äôs just super awkward. Can‚Äôt trust Mom. Husband is laughing at my pain

Obligatory this happened a few days ago.
So recently I had to go off the pill. I was only on it due to a hormonal condition and not actually because I was trying to control any births.
As of right now I live in the states with my husband and I‚Äôm sure anyone reading this would know how expensive prescriptions in this bountiful country can be. My body has only ever agreed with one brand of birth control which unfortunately is not covered by my insurance here and I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs illegal to send prescriptions through the mail so here we are. About 4 generic versions of the pill later and a whole bunch of depressing body changes, I decided it was time to just come off the pill and my doctor gave me the okay but warned me there would still be side effects.
So I let my mom know mainly because she‚Äôs a nurse but also because I‚Äôm not shy to share personal things with my mom, especially about health. I specifically asked her not to mention all of this birth control talk to my Dad because my Dad and I are pretty much best friends and I figured it would just be an awkward conversation plus why would we ever need to discuss my lady issues anyways right? 
Unbeknownst to me, my mom somehow brought up my issues to my Dad in what she says was just a ‚Äúcasual conversation‚Äù. As I write this I‚Äôm realizing maybe the fuck up was telling my mom in the first place lol 

So I get a call from my Dad that started off like this: 

Dad: Hey is everything okay? Your mom told me you‚Äôve been having some issues lately 

Me: Issues? No I‚Äôm okay Dad. 

Dad: Well she told me about your birth control. You know you don‚Äôt need any of that 

Me: Oh well I did Dad. Remember a few years ago when we went to the doctor for my hormone issues? 

Dad: Oh I think I recall but very vaguely. But anyways I wanted to tell you there‚Äôs no need for all of that. You just need proper family planning. Those pills have so many side effects 

Me: Well we‚Äôre not planning on having kids yet Dad 

Dad: But with this PLAN that I have you‚Äôd never have to worry about becoming pregnant unexpectedly 

Me: *little confused, kinda irritated because I thought I explained why I was on the pill in the first place* 

Dad I wasn‚Äôt on it because I was trying to actually control a birth from happening. I can handle that 

Dad: I see. Okay well please check your email. I just sent you something 

*checks email while on the phone with him* 

My Dad sent me a whole ass powerpoint presentation that he put together himself, for ME, about Family planning. It was loaded. Had a whole calendar in there and everything. What happens when a birth is unplanned. Everything about ovulation. The slides were even animated. My husband was listening as we briefly went over said powerpoint and could barely hold his laughter in. It was like this awkward sex ed class but from a concerned/caring parent. I wanted to crawl up into a ball and disintegrate but I told him I appreciate the concern and the effort? 
I know My Dad has my best intentions at heart always and he knows Kids are not in the plan yet so this was his way of giving me advice. 
But we‚Äôre basically talking about my sex life here, with my Dad, by way of a powerpoint.  Cringe. 

Archived the power point though because it was super informative and I also applaud my Dad for trying to find the best way for him to give me advice despite the awkwardness/me wanting to disappear into a black hole. Husband laughed so hard when we hung up that I saw tears

EDIT: Okay WOAHHHHH! This blew up. Wtf! Thank you kind strangers for the awards. I am not worthy!!!

So a couple things: 

1. I see a consensus for wanting a copy of this powerpoint and as much I‚Äôd love to share it with you all, it does have a couple baby pictures of my Dad and I when he was all happy I was born LOL BUT ALSO my Dad is on reddit and if by some twist of fate he reads this, I wouldn‚Äôt want him to see his personal powerpoint just pop up places without his consent. 

2. I appreciate all the love for my Dad and he would truly appreciate it as well. Being a parent to me was not the easiest job but he‚Äôs been my best friend no matter what. He‚Äôs going to be an amazing grandpa. 

3. Dad, if you happen to read this, I appreciate you and I love you and I‚Äôm thankful for everything you do for me including the awkward PowerPoints ‚ù§Ô∏è

Edit 2: 

1. My mom isn‚Äôt a narc. Lol. I don‚Äôt mind that she shared the info because I know it came from a place of love and concern 

2. I see a few comments of having prescriptions mailed to me, yes they would be coming from a different country and I guess it is possible? But either way I‚Äôm okay with giving my body a little rest

3. We are a mixed race and religion family and my parents beliefs have never been forced on me or on each other ‚ò∫Ô∏è",7936,356,tifu
t3_klb9q9,TIFU by kidnapping a dog,"So this happened earlier today on my way to work.

I have to walk through a suburbian-area near a park when suddenly a small dog, no leash, no collar, no nothing crosses my path. 

I stop, I look around but there is not one person to be seen anywhere. So I shout ""Hello?"" - no answer. Poor dog must have run away, I presume. Having a dog myself (of whom I'm surprised he hasn't run away yet) I know I would be devastated if he did indeed run away one day.

So I did, or tried atleast, to do what I would expect any caring person to do for my dog as well. I lure the dog to come closer, give him a few pets and try to pick him up. Dog starts to struggle but I'm thinking ""oh no, he will never be returned to his owner when he gets away, I must catch him!"" So I try to grab him by the hind legs, which in retrospect sounds awful... And the dog probably thinks the same and starts to whine and bark 

At this moment I hear a person shout ""HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GET AWAY FROM MY DOG!"" Flabberghasted, I let go of the dog which runs away from me, terrified. Rightly so. The person sat in his backyard and let his dog go about next to the street alone, which is VERY uncommon where I'm from.

I mumble ""Oh sorry, I thought he was lost"" and scurry away red as a tomato. I cringe so hard thinking about this, I hope he heard my mumbles and doesn't think I'm some kind of psycho collecting pets for sacrifices or something.

Tl;dr Thought a lonesome dog ran away, tried to pick him up violently and got shouted at by the owner who sat in his backyard, letting his dog go about by himself",23,7,tifu
t3_klaq63,TIFU -- By Calling The Cops On An Arguing Couple,"Obligatory -- This happened quite a few years ago. Before cellphones.

I was taking a walk one day, and the neighborhood I lived in at the time wasn't the best.  It was mostly working-class -- primarily aircraft workers -- but because the houses were so cheap to rent, there were also quite a few ""questionable"" residents.

Anyhow, a ways ahead of me was a girl who was going in the same direction I was.  She was far enough away, and my eyesight isn't all that great, and she was pretty petite, so I assumed it was a kid headed toward the elementary school about a block away. 

I remember thinking that I hoped she had a note for being so late to class, when a plain, white van screeched to a stop right by her.  I mean, this was a stereotypical, windowless, unmarked, white van. It was... a murder van. I was certain of it.

The driver got out, and took the girl by her shoulders and sort of pushed her into the van.  They were too far away for me to catch up and try and protect the girl, so the only thing I could think to do is to memorize the tag and the best description I could of the girl.

Van takes off, and I practically ran to the elementary school.  Like I said, before cellphones. I told the school secretary what I'd witnessed and she called the police. They showed up fairly quickly (I guess a kidnapped kid will light a fire under their asses). I gave them the description of the girl, the van, and the tag. They ran the plates, and the address was only about 3-4 blocks away. *Another* car was sent to the address, while the officer at the school continued to take my report. I swear, I'd never seen cops move so fast.

About ten or so minutes later, the other officer radioed in, and come to find out, the guy was the girl's boyfriend, she was an adult, they lived with her mother, and they had apparently been having an argument, which is why she was out, and why he came and fetched her.

I was so embarrassed, but the secretary and the officer thought it was amusing. So everything turned out good in the end, and I decided I'd had enough reality for one day, so headed back toward home. I found the house the girl and her boyfriend lived in (I wasn't searching for it, it was just on my way), and they were all three outside.

I came up to them, introduced myself, and apologized for the chaos earlier. They laughed it off, and the girl's mother said, ""I'm glad you did call, because what if she really was a little kid who was kidnapped? Besides, maybe it'll teach her not to air her fights in public from now on.""

So, it all ended well, but holy crap did it scare me silly.

TL;DR -- Called the cops because I thought I'd witnessed a kidnapping, but it was just a girl and her BF arguing.",165,20,tifu
t3_klab05,TIFU Ugly Sweater Contest,"Back when I was a sophomore in highschool we had a some sort of holiday spirit week that involved dressing up for certain days. Most people did not dress up, but we had a few diehard participants.

I walked into my chemistry class and saw that my chemistry teacher was wearing a Christmas sweater that I assumed was for the ugly sweater contest. She hadn't done any of the other spirit days and I thought it was nice that she was getting into it.
I decided to encourage her and kindly told her that she was going to win the ugly sweater contest.
Through her teeth she informed me that the sweater contest was the next day and she rather liked the sweater.

I sat in the back of the class that day.
I already had not been her favorite student, but after this she was incredibly cold to me for the rest of the year.

Now, I should mention that my boyfriend and my brother have sort of similar sounding names. Occasionally I will mix up their names in conversation and will immediately cringe at myself, or will ask Siri to call the wrong person. This was the worst possible time to have a mixup like this.

I realized my mistake as soon as I hit send. My boyfriend then came into the room and I told him what I had done, to which he looked horrified then burst out laughing. I tried calling my brother twice, no answer. I spammed our chat so he would have to scroll up to see the picture.

Finally, I called my sister in law and instructed her to go on his phone and delete our entire chat history before he saw the picture. At least on my phone, you do not have to open the chat in order to delete its history. I severely hope it is the same on Samsung :(

Either way, I think I saved the situation because my brother did not see my tits. But the panic I felt in such a short amount of time (start to finish it was probably a minute and a half) was so intense.

t3_kl8y28,TIFU almost choking to death during a massive communications infrastructure outage,"Obligatory ""this happened a few days ago"" statement: this actually happened on Christmas night.

Side note but important to the situation, I am in Kentucky and the bombing in Nashville affected our cellular service here (over a 2 hrs drive to get to Nashville from here). We didn't have service for 2 days only getting it back here as of this morning, so any communication had to go through WiFi networks not reliant on AT&amp;T or you didn't communicate.

After part of Christmas evening at a friend's house I drove home. It was a 45 minute drive and I hadn't eaten since that morning and I was getting hungry. We had steak (flank steak in fact) for Christmas Eve dinner and there was exactly one piece left in the fridge for me. My kids had eaten the rest almost the second we got home Christmas Eve night. Man, I couldn't wait to get that one slice of steak in my mouth! That drive home I was listening to a book, but in the back of my mind I was only thinking about that piece of steak.

I get home and see my oldest's car is gone, so he was out with friends still as well. I get inside, greeted by my dogs and I yell, ""hello?"" trying to determine where my youngest (14yo son) was. He's playing on the computer playing games with friends with a headset on as well...

Great. He's there and fine... STEAK!!! Damn I was hungry! I go tearing through my fridge trying to find that one last slice of steak and finally find it. I pull it out and salt the piece up and begin to eat it, ripping bites off with my teeth (fuck a fork and knife). It's a tough steak at this point as it is cold and flank tends to be very chewy when put back in the fridge for leftovers, but I love chewy steaks. The flavor is amazing and I quickly scoff down my first bite. 

I take a second bite and this is a bit more chewy as it's a bit thicker than my first bite, but I don't care. It's really tasty! Chew chew chew chew chew and swallow. Looking at what's left in my hand I could have made it 2, even 3 bites but my hungry ass said fuck it and put the whole piece in my mouth.

Immediately I realize this is way too much in my mouth and being that it's so damn chewy this is work in mouth. I thought I had worked on that bite for a while, but I think it was more that it had become a lot of work attempting to chew it up, so I just swallowed it.

I feel it go down the back of my mouth and it was really hard to swallow, but after attempting to do this I realize I can't get it down and my reflexes have me constantly swallowing. Over and over I am attempting to swallow and it's not moving. Bcz I'm constantly trying to swallow I am unable to breath either.

Standing at the counter in the kitchen I look to my left and see a glass of ice water on the counter. Probably my oldest's, but whatever; it's got ice in it so it's fairly ""fresh"". I get the dumb idea that if I just swallow it down with some water I'll be able to get it to go down so I reach for it and take a drink.

And with that the piece of steak lodges itself INSIDE my windpipe. I could feel it. The food wasn't where it needed to be in my throat. Furthermore it has become apparent to me that I cannot inhale. OH SHIT! I'm actually choking!!! I don't have much air in my lungs are this point and bcz of that I cannot cough!!!

Fear quickly sets in and I run around the corner to get my son's attention to get help! I go to the computer, tap on his shoulder and he looks at me. I do the sign that I am choking and he looks at me like ""what?"" DOUBLE SHIT!!! My youngest doesn't know what I meant!!! I can't explain to him what is happening or what I needed.

With fear in my eyes, I'm now beginning to feel the first symptoms of oxygen deprivation set in. I go to a chair in the house to try to do the Heimlich on myself. My nose is running, my mouth is drooling, my eyes are watering... My body is doing everything it can to get whatever out of me and it's just making me more panicked. I even remember thinking to myself, ""shit. I just ruined Christmas for my family for the rest of their lives.""

The chair I came to was low enough that I needed to bend down and somewhat over it to get the leverage I need to thrust my fists up into my diaphragm. When I did this I could feel the meat move just slightly in my windpipe. Not much, but just enough that I can get a small trickle of air around it. I can feel that sensation while writing this. I could almost visualize it. The hole that allowed the air through couldn't have been much bigger than a cocktail straw, but it was enough and I slowly, but with purpose begin to inhale knowing that I could accidently pull the steak even further into my windpipe if I do this too quickly.

With the position I was in and being that I finally got some air in my lungs I was able to give a big cough and out of my mouth comes the steak. I'm finally able to take an actual breath, but I spend the next several minutes coughing up bits and pieces of the steak that had been chewed off or rubbed off while choking on it while large strings of snot stream from my nose.

I Iook up and see my 14yo son looking at me in total horror. It was sinking in to him what he had just witnessed. If I hadn't been able to cough it back up some how I would be dead. We couldn't call 911. The phones were down across the whole county, so even if I had collapsed on the floor he wouldn't have been able to call anyone for help. 

My oldest walked in while I was still slumped over the chair with the steak piece half chewed up on the seat. He had no idea what had happened. He thought I had thrown up maybe or it could have been something strange from another seizure (I have epilepsy), so he was just standing there also. When inwas able to tell him what happened he also looked scared for a bit. I think my youngest was traumatized by the event, but he isn't wanting to talk about it. My oldest seems to have recovered quickly from this. I literally had that euphoric feel for about 12 hours afterwards. I felt like George Bailey at the end of it's a wonderful Life.

Lucky this is an (almost) fuck up and an easy lesson learned the hard way. In short, don't swallow massive steak bites without chewing them up completely!!!

t3_kl8xkh,"TIFU by maybe chickenly refusing a mysterious shaggadelic man of mystery job (or by being insane, you tell me)","(Its an old story but I feel I gotta tell this one as I still wonder what happened that day)

So I was a kid back then studying -redacted- in -redacted-. Just finished my master degree. Was Mid-20. Was decades ago.

I used to go outdoor for semi-binge drinking in my area with a couple friends. I have this nice guy face that basically attract strange/intoxicated people (its a real issue) and Im by all account a weirdo magnet (maybe it take one to attract one). I lived in a place with high urban density where its common for people to approach you to spill their guts, bum a smoke or just drunkardly talk BS.

So we are sitting here outdoor on this nice waterfont with my best pal talking about stuff and other when this guy approached us, bumed us a smoke and started talking. He had his own beer and looked friendly so he somehow began to talk with us.

The thing is, our conversation pretty much look like a mix of drunky [r/politic](https://www.reddit.com/r/politic/) and [r/worldnews](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/) and it turn out the guy who describe himself as a ex-military is pretty much into geopolitic and full of interesting anecdotes, stories. He look also dangerous.

At that point im not dead drunk but the conversation is getting wild like a 6th beer is. So my friend offer to get to a nearby shop to pick snacks to soak it up.

Im left at that point alone with Gi Joe and the conversation change drastically.

*- You know that guy from -redacted- who told you about -very specific detail of geoplitic- he is full of shit.*

*- What the fuck?*

*- Yeah -my full real name that I didn't told him, spelt perfectly- your geopolitics teacher is full of shit. Wanna hear the true story about -cold war even most people don't give a fuck or never heard about-? You'll like it.*

So I denie everything and play dumb and even pretend the name provided is wrong. Im pretty sure I have a psychotic episode and getting full blown paranoid. Maybe somebody dosed my beer and Im tripping balls? I have the impression I am being tested by that guy, that he want to see if im destabilized. I did a pretty poor job at being shill.

See, I consider curiosity my cardinal flaw and I have the impression this was designed to adress that very quirk.

At that point my pal is back and he feel something off. But he sat and listen.

Conversation is now back at a less awkward but still strange level. With small details that match stuff I did, like or said. But it might be a coincidence right? My pal at some point interrupt and ask:

*- Do you guys know each other? Because you look like you know a lot about him?*

\- W*ell its up to him to get to know me better, we can be friends. Here is my number kid. You'll need a job soon.*

So they guy leave just as he arrived, but somehow took the time to get a brand new pack of cigarets out of his pocket (remember, he bummed us a smoke, thats how everything started) and light one.

About 5 minutes later I had a mild panic attack.

*- Did you had trouble with the mafia, that guy looked like he was making your an offer you cant refuse.*

*- Dude I had no idea what the fuck was happening.*

I don't remember if I threw the number or lost it. I never talked about this for year with the pal until recently he casually said ""hey you remember that time secret services tried to recruit you as a spy lol""?

But to this day I really wonder what would have happened If I called back. Or If I had a good old paranoid episode, Mr robot style.

Frankly I don't know what would be the worst.

t3_kl8h47,TIFU by obliterating my family jewels while trying to improve my Jedi skills in VR.,"Hello reddit, happy holidays! My first TIFU worthy action, wohoo. 

This happened 1 hour ago, I just recovered from the pain enough to post this. 

It all started 4 months ago with me buying an Oculus Rift S for exercising during the lockdown and to play a lot of Beat Saber (fruit ninja on music in VR, look it up, it is really fun). Well, I played like an animal for 1 month then got bored with it and I ended up using the headset once a week on average for the past 3 months.

This all changed on Christmas morning when I found out that my friends bought a Quest 2 for Christmas. Now, we are supposed to meet and spend the new year together all 4 of us and of course we are going to play Beat Saber. It is simply unacceptable for me to not dominate that game and I HAD to get back in shape and train at light sabering blocks on music.

So on the 25th my training started, I quickly got \*back to a decent level and we arrive to the day of the fuckup. I was really trying hard to pass the song Given Up by Linkin Park, it was my 8th try so I got frustrated and had sweaty hands. I never bothered to change the height of the player in the settings so the game thinks I am 30cm shorter. To solve this I stay in a [kind of horse stance](https://imgur.com/a/r2WAhFJ) while playing. The way I hold the controllers is a bit odd since you need to be able to swing it really fast (here's a [preview](https://imgur.com/a/g1J40IB)). Even though my grip isn't too solid, I never worry about it since the controllers are attached to my wrists with a ""safety"" [string](https://imgur.com/a/RmXeyVD). It's not big deal if they slip from your hand (BOY was I wrong).

Here's the fuckup that lowered my chances of having kids (probably for the best, given this IQ display): there were two blocks approaching in the lower front part, both my hands were up so I channel all my frustration and began a mighty swing downwards, when my hands reached the lowest point of the swing and stopped my right controller slipped from my sweaty hand and unsurprisingly continued the arcing motion colliding with the between my legs part, which was completely exposed from my stance. Immense pain ensued, I dropped down, tearing up a bit with the VR headset still on, now hearing the sound of failure in my headphones, and then everything went dark. I'll admit, it took a few minutes until I got up from the ground to resume my misery in bed instead of the floor. Luckily nobody figured out that I was in immense pain for the better part of one hour and it went unnoticed by the people in the house.

Moral of the story? Don't tryhard in a game that nobody cares about just for 3 seconds of glory. Also keep your legs together and change that DAMN setting.

TL;DR:  I was playing Beat Saber in VR, swung my hands down, the controller slipped from my hand and attached by the safety string hit it continued the swinging motion into my nuts.",15,6,tifu

t3_kl72d0,TIFU by accidently flirting with a high school teacher," So this f\*\*k up happened 3 yrs ago whilst I was in undergrad. At the time I was super socially awkward and had difficulty **appropriately** communicating with other people. Like either I‚Äôd stay silent or basically have no filter. I tried handling it by forcing myself into more social and public-speaking situations which is partly why I enrolled in a mentorship program that required me to go to high schools and engage students in presentations and activities about different topics. So me and 2 other mentors (also girls) went to an all-boys high school to talk to them about that yr‚Äôs topic: ‚Äòdiversity‚Äô. I tried conversing with the girls on the train-ride to the school but they weren‚Äôt too responsive and eventually began talking to each other in (what I assume is) their native language and I was shut out of that conversation. So we get to the school, meet the class teacher, he introduces us, we do the presentation and then assign activities to the students. Whilst they‚Äôre completing the activities, the 2 girls move to the side of the class and begin talking to each other. I didn‚Äôt feel welcome to engage with them and began feeling awkward standing in front of the class by myself. I think the teacher (mid/late 20s guy) saw I was feeling uncomfortable and approached me and asked how I thought the presentation went. We then engaged in some basic convo (how I got into the program, what degree I‚Äôm doing and why I‚Äôm doing it). I flipped the questions to him and he elaborated how he got into teaching. I eventually asked if he‚Äôs ever taught at an all-girls high school and which one he prefers.

Him: Yeah. But it was more awkward with all-girls because of the way they were all silently staring at me.

Me: Y‚Äôthink the whole class had a crush on you cuz I can understand why.

It was only the microsecond after I said that, did I realize what I had just implied. My cheeks probably turned red and there was 1-2 seconds of awkward silence. Then I just excused myself outta that convo by saying that its almost time for the class to regroup and I had to check in with the other mentors. Took me the remainder of the day to process that f\*\*\* up. For the record, what I actually meant to imply was that ‚Äúyou think the students had a crush on you?

t3_kl6twr,TIFU by snagging my messed-up big toenail on the bottom of my other foot,"I am NOT a feet person.

So this happened about 15 minutes ago but stems from an issue that started about a decade ago. Here is where I screwed up:

About 7 years ago, I went to a foot doctor because I had a little fungus growing on both of my big toe toenails. I thought it wasn‚Äôt that much of an issue. However, the doctor tells me that the issue is actually much worse than I expected and he needed to remove my two toenails and apply some antibiotic cream to the nail beds. He numbs up my feet, gives me a ton of novacane (2 shots per toe :/ ) and we get the procedure done. Everything seems great. 

Cut to 6 months in the future, and my new toenails are green and curled - picture snail shells. Not good. We go back in and do laser treatment. Still no good. Repeated toenail removal again and laser treatment. The doctor finally applied a cream to my nail beds to just kill the nails. Problem resolved. Not.

For the past two years, I‚Äôve just been dealing with the discomfort. The nails in fact did not die. My nail beds adapted and started to grow from where the tissue is still alive - the snail shells now grow from the insides of my toes, curling across the tops to the outside of my feet. Besides the occasional snag on socks and other clothing, there isn‚Äôt any pain. Just super sensitive. I‚Äôve had people step on my feet before, and without the protection of toenails it hurts quite a lot. 

Cut to today: I‚Äôm sitting at my desk, and I‚Äôm not wearing any socks. I‚Äôm sitting so my feet are crossed under my desk. Mindlessly, I lift my right foot over the top of my left. Instant pain. My right foot had snagged underneath my left toenail (which grows towards the left) and my nail was pulled straight upwards. Like I said, instant pain.

Now, I am looking at my toe: I can see that I am bleeding from under the nail and the nail itself is pointed upwards. The nail is broken from the bottom - there is no chance I put socks on without trimming it. The small movement was painful, but the real pain is about to be the DIY toenail procedure i am about to do in my bathroom. I am hyping myself up for the immense sensitivity overload I am about to feel when I go to town on my nail. 

Like I said, I am NOT a feet person.

I thought to myself have I done the worst possible thing in this scenario and as I checked if my mic was on, I learned that I had indeed done it. I said all that with my mic on. The class was a scary level of quiet and me being the brave guy with an extraordinary sense of responsibility, I got out of that call faster than the speed of light. 

I still don‚Äôt know if the teacher knows if it was me and what the consequences will be if he finds out if it was me

t3_kl55fx,TIFU by not having birthday,"So like many stories here this did not happen today but about 8 years ago. If you are looking for another naughty tifu, sorry to disappoint, nothing spicy here. Not even sure if there is a lesson to be learned...
Also - english not first language, formating mobile, yada yada...

So this all started with a joke where I created a false identity meeting a few new friends who did not know me before over a weekend for shits and giggles. So the old friends were in it and just called me by a different name and the new ones got to know me by this new name - funny stuff and by the end of the weekend I even reacted to my new fake name on reflex just like my actual name.
Coming home I started to change my internet persona to this fake name - facebook, whatsapp, etc and thought well that's good for my privacy, since my friends surely knew who it was and no need to give real name to Mr. Zuckerberg and friends.
Since then every internet-login which did not really require my real name got this fake-persona which does really help with identifying spam (LPT right here). Of course over time this persona did get his own address, birthday etc - so even if I forgot my password on a random site I could restore it with ease. Everything went fine - people on facebook would congratulate on the wrong day of course but who cares. My closer friends who knew my real birthday would congratulate with things like ""happy Tuesday"" or similar enjoying the inside joke.
Fast forward to the Tifu:
2 years later, I still have my internet-persona, thinking nothing about it when...well... It is my personas birthday and there is a Business-Dinner pre Christmas on my workplace.
So I arrive there and the whole staff is sitting in a circle waiting for me - and starts singing happy birthday led by my coworker as soon as I enter ""Yeah, I saw you have birthday on Facebook, surprise!"". I'm just standing there, stopped dead in my tracks and realising what the fuck ist happening. My brain is on damage prevention mode trying to find a way out while they start to sing the second verse. There is no way I'm going to tell all those singing people that in fact I do not have birthday today - or so I think - well just play along and get this over with. They will be happy to have made me happy with the surprise and I do not have to tell them that they just fell for a 2y old joke... Spoiler: Not the best decision...
So they sing their song, I say thank you and can we please start with the food but every damn one of the staff now decides they absolutely want to personally congratulate and hug. Well now it's obviously too late and surely I thank everyone for their best wishes. This took what felt like ages and there only where two or three people left when everything went absolutely downhill as our personal management lady entered and realized what was going on. She is the one responsible for all the 
birthday present/card stuff in the office and was shocked to seemingly having forgotten my birthday. I'm just standing there like a deer looking into the headlights of impeding doom. ""But O. I thought your birthday was in 3 months? Let me check my calendar"" - Silence in the whole room - Everybody is looking at me with something between confusion and disgust while I finally admit not having birthday and telling about my fake internet-birthday.
Worst christmas dinner ever followed...

TLDR; Had fake birthday on FB, co-workers sang and congratulated, decided to play along and got exposed, followed by a silent and awkward business-christmas-dinner.",10,2,tifu

I was in middle school and my friend was sleeping over so we decided to play Star Wars battlefront 2. At the time I had a ps2 that was able to stand straight up, this is important for later. Anyways me and my friend are playing hero‚Äôs vs villains on Mos Eisley and I was playing Chewbacca. Well I discovered that if you time it right and sprint jump over his time bomb, Chewy will blast off across the map with this rag doll effect while yelling. 

Here‚Äôs where I fucked up. I showed my buddy and we start pissing ourselves laughing and decided to replicate this for hours. At one point I was laughing so hard that I rocked forward and my head slammed into the corner of my ps2. I was in instant pain but didn‚Äôt think much about it cause I was laughing so hard. That is until I went to put my hand on my head and felt something warm. I went to the bathroom and turned the light on (we were playing in the dark) and saw that blood was all over my white t shirt and pouring out from my eyebrow. 

Anyways I head upstairs and casually say to my mom  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bleeding‚Äù. She turned around from cutting peppers and saw me covered in blood. My dad ended up coming home from work and my friend came with me to the hospital as I got my eyebrow stitched up.

t3_kl3raz,"TIFU by sitting down too hard on the toilet, literally destroying it","So yesterday I wanted to go for a walk, in an attempt to burn some of the Christmas calories that I had been shovelling my face with for several days straight.

Light snowfall and no wind, so I thought why not make it a long one. I decided to do one that around town is called ""Around the Bridges,"" which is 15km (9.3 miles) long. A nice walk, far away from any traffic for the most part, crossing the river running through town at to difference points.

About a quarter of the way through I noticed the snowfall had started to pick up, but didn't think much about it. Forecast said it would be too much snow coming down, and wind wasn't supposed to go all crazy either. Double checked on my phone, and forecast had barely checked. So I kept going.

Halfway through however and I realised the meteorologists had been lying too me.

So. Much. Snow. And it was coming down sideways because of the fucking wind. 

To make it even worse I had noticed the snow wasn't really ""bouncing"" off my snowpants and jacket like it had in the beginning. The temperature had started to rise. So instead it was clinging to my clothing, making me wet. Frustration started growing.

By the time I got home I was soaked. Cold. Face hurting from squinting, trying to avoid snow coming into my eyes.

Immediately went to the bathroom to get undressed to avoid getting the hallway floor too wet.

With the clothes off I threw myself on the toilet seat, kinda like you would do on a recliner or a couch, after a long and annoying day at work.

Not my best move.

I [cracked the ceramic](https://i.imgur.com/n67X2DT.jpg) on [both sides](https://i.imgur.com/b7KA4O1.jpg) of the toilet. Front part game off the floor and the whole thing is now leaning. I turned my toilet into an actual recliner.

I called the property owner's emergency lined, but since it's not leaking water, they deemed it's not an emergency and I will have to wait until Monday to make a report with the normal customer service, and I would assume it's not getting fixed until after New Years.

Until then I will have to go outside to a building where all residents share laundry facility to do my business. It's still snowing heaps, it's still windy as fuck.

So because I got so pissed off from a snow storm I broke my toilet, I know have to go through a snowstorm to have a shit.

TL;DR: got pissed off walking through a snowstorm, threw myself on the toilet when I came home cracking the ceramic. Because of the holidays I will now, for several days, have to go outside through more snowstorms to do my business.",308,42,tifu
t3_kl2nts,TIFU by looking like I was trying to lure neighborhood kids.,"This happened yesterday and I am equal parts amused and mortified. 

I live in a very average suburban neighborhood. Kids playing in the streets, neighbors are friendly, you get the idea. 

I recently bought a beat up old pickup truck. I have a daily driver, but this truck is for Home Depot runs and the like. Personally I love it, but I have been made aware of the effect it has on people. This will become relevant soon. 

A few weeks ago a tree went down at a neighbor‚Äôs house right around the corner from my house. The tree company came and cut it into logs. It‚Äôs been sitting on the neighbor‚Äôs front lawn ever since. I have a fireplace so I‚Äôve had my eye on the wood.  I figured If they‚Äôre not using it, I can swing by and load it in my truck to chop up. The thing is, I‚Äôve never met these neighbors. I don‚Äôt know their names and I never see them outside. So I‚Äôve just been sort of waiting until I happen to see somebody out front to ask about the logs. 

Fast forward to today. I‚Äôm driving by in my beat up old truck and I see a couple of kids coming out of the house. Two boys, probably 10-12 years old. Great, I figure I‚Äôll pull over and ask if their parents are home to inquire about the wood. So I pull up on the curb. The thing is, I didn‚Äôt see them until I was almost to their house, so I guess I pulled up kind of fast. Well they must have been freaked out by my shitty pickup or my speedy maneuver or whatever because they fuckin‚Äô bolted the second they saw me. So now I‚Äôm in a predicament because I don‚Äôt want our neighbors to see me speed up and then kids run away like I‚Äôm some kind of weirdo. So I roll down the window and say ‚Äúhey are your parents home? I need to ask them a question?‚Äù They hear me (I think) but keep running. So now I‚Äôm sitting in my shitty truck, waiting to see how this plays out, when it occurs to me that I probably now look REALLY creepy because I‚Äôm pulling over fast, kids are running, and I‚Äôm yelling at them. So I decide the best move is to sit outside the house for a second to think. I figure it‚Äôs best to go knock on the door and see if mom or dad are home. So I do. Push the ring door bell. I also make sure my face is on camera so I don‚Äôt seem like some creep. The thing is nobody answers. I shrug and go home. Which is literally 4 houses away and forget the whole thing. 

Fast forward, 3 hours later, I‚Äôm cleaning up after dinner and my wife says ‚Äúhey, there‚Äôs a cop car outside by your truck.‚Äù Oh no. Before I make it to the door, he knocks. Yep. You guessed it. Neighbor called to report an attempting luring of her children. Apparently they told her that ‚Äúa man pulled up in an old truck and said that he has parrot and asked if we wanted to see it.‚Äù What I really said was ‚Äúare your parents home?‚Äù Police officer and I had a good laugh. He went over and explained it. Neighbor feels better. Turns out I can have the logs too.

After sharing screen then I can enter the uni website, turn on my camera and answer the questions. Easy right? 

I didn‚Äôt expect to fuck it up either. So I was anxious about today‚Äôs exam and wanted to finish it asap. I answered the call from examiner, shared my screen, entered uni website and started answering questions. 

I was on question no.2 when he stopped me. He told me to share my screen. I was weirded out and went back to check the app just to realize I hadn‚Äôt press the button to allow the screen to share üò≠ 

I started panicking, my mind recalled stories of students being kicked out of their online exam because of suspicious behavior etc. I was breaking out in cold sweat.

I didn‚Äôt know what to do. Discussion on the other side continued. Finally, the tester got back to me and said the problem is resolved and I could continue the exam. 

I fucked up but I still got lucky, I guess. My focus on the exam however went out of the window. Now I‚Äôm in my bed but I still got chills when I thought about what happened earlier today. I just need to get this off my chest cuz the thought of it keeps on bugging me.

This happened around a year ago and the shame still affects me to this day.

Usually i get in the shower, turn on the fan, turn off bluetooth, put on a nice video and get to work. That one day i was particularly lazy and i forgot to turn off bluetooth. Usually it would be fine, nothing to connect to, but a week prior my overly religious parents had travelled and left me home by myself. I was using the TV sound bar day long listening to music, podcasts... Whatever i could listen to to avoid depression.

I get in the shower, turn on the water, turn on the video and i notice there‚Äôs no sound at all coming from my phone. So like the genius that i am, i proceed to spend the next 20 minutes lowering and raising the volume to see if it makes a difference. I even changed videos a few times... ‚ÄúWeird‚Äù the young man thought to himself proceeding to rip his penis off by the intensity. 

I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time so i go out of the shower, walk in the kitchen, and my poor mother is sitting there resting her head on her hand.

t3_kkxrsi,TIFU by ruining my Christmas proposal,"Obligatory this happened 5 years ago on Christmas Day. 

A bit of backstory ... I had a slip and all accident about 3 months prior to Christmas day in which I had dislocated my shoulder, hurt my back and broke a few toes. I would control the pain majority of the time with just advil and tylenol but when I overdid it and was really hurting, I would take a prescribed combination of muscle relaxer and pain medication which I considered my ""zombie pills"" as they would make me feel pretty drowsy and out of it. 

This was my first Christmas Eve living with C. We had met online and lived on opposite sides of the country. We spent a year dating long distance before I had finally moved in with him in June. To celebrate our first Christmas together, and my first away from my family, we went all out. We had a HUGE Christmas Eve dinner which I did 90% of the cooking. We were spoiled with gifts from his family and we were just all super excited to be together for the first year. It was over and above! 

After dinner, I was in pain, knowing I had overdone things. I wanted to take my ""zombie pills"" about 9:00 pm and go to bed, however, I had to check in to a flight at midnight as I was flying across the country to see my family on Christmas day night. So instead, I stayed awake and pushed through the pain. At midnight I was able to check into my flight. I was hurting enough that I decided to take the zombie pills then. 

At 5:00 am my phone rang. It was tradition that we wake up at 7:00 am every year. My mom and brothers were awake (it was 7:00 am for them). C and I sleepily got out of bed and went to the living room and did a video call with my family. We decided since we were awake we might as well open our Christmas gifts. Once we were done, I was falling asleep on the couch and so C told me to go to bed for awhile longer. 

A few hours later he woke me up and with the promise of making me bacon, I got out of bed and went to the kitchen. We put bacon in the oven and he prompted me to look at the tree, he had forgot a gift earlier. I felt SO out of it, but I went to the tree and saw nothing underneath. He encouraged me to keep looking and I found a bag hanging on the tree. I just knew. I knew that inside that bag would be a ring. I pulled it off the tree and sure enough, there was a ring box. I opened the box and it was empty. When I turned around, he was on one knee and he asked me to be his forever. The first thing I said was ""get up"" and then of course I said yes. 

I cry at every single proposal video and story, and yet, I didn't cry at my own proposal. I felt like I was smiling bigger than ever, and yet my insides were numb. I felt like a zombie. Everything was just a bit muted. C was expecting me to cry, he was expecting a ton of emotion and excitement and although I was trying to exude emotion, I felt like I was faking it. C kept asking me if I was ok and I kept having to reassure him that I was happy. 

He still teases me for not crying during our proposal. 

It turned out ok, that was 5 years ago and we have now been married 3.5 years. I am happier than I have ever been. But that moment that should have been so exciting and special, was ZOMBIED and muted.

Anyway, we decided on playing cards against humanity and I was being my drunk boisterous self. My girlfriend at my side, I felt confident that I'd be kept in check.

Then a black card mentioned the clit. A female friend of mine mispronounced the word. Naturally my drunk 27 y/o brain with the maturity of a 12 y/o thought this was the funniest thing since her boyfriend is a friend of mine.

He wasn't in this call but I started laughing like an imbecile joking that, well, he didn't know where it was. My drunk mind thought that HER mispronouncing it meant HE didn't know where it was. You know, typical drunken idiot stuff.

t3_kkx92h,TIFU by going to the ER with back pain.,"Obligatory this didn‚Äôt actually happen today, but the realization of the situation did.

It all started 3 days ago. I woke up with really bad back pain near my left shoulder blade.  As the day went on it was getting worse and worse. By the end of the day it was painful to take a deep breath. With a fear that it might be something with my lung or heart, I decide to go to the walk-in clinic to get a professional opinion.  Once there, the doc ordered a chest X-ray to rule out a collapsed lung.  Nothing irregular on the X-ray so they diagnosed it as musculoskeletal and prescribed muscle relaxers and an oral steroid.  They also recommended that if I have any shortness of breath I should go to the ER.

The next day I wake up and the pain is much much worse. I took the day off work as I couldn‚Äôt imagine sitting upright in my chair all day. Eventually the pain was so sharp and severe that it was taking my breath away for 4-5 seconds at a time. This went on a few times a minute for about an hour before I had had enough. I called my mom to pick me up and take me to the ER. Something was not right, and I wasn‚Äôt buying just plain ole back pain. 

After checking into the ER and talking with a nurse while periodically holding my breath and fighting through the stabbing pain, a CT was ordered. Again, nothing irregular on the CT so  now clotting in the lung could be ruled out.  After about a 5 hour stay, I was again discharged with a diagnosis of a musculoskeletal issue. Luckily the periodic breath taking pain had subsided thanks to a pain injection.  I get home and go to bed pretty early as I‚Äôm not feeling great from all of the new medications I‚Äôve been taking the past couple of days.

The next morning (today) I wake up and I‚Äôm feeling much better. Still have back pain, but no pain when breathing at all. My wife stayed up last night researching my condition trying to figure out exactly what it could be. She found that a medication I‚Äôve been on for a couple months has a common side effect of muscle spasms. I decided to do some research myself as I didn‚Äôt really know exactly what a spasm was. I‚Äôll be damned if it wasn‚Äôt exactly what had been happening to me the previous day. I watched several videos of treatments and causes when I found a potential cause that really caught my eye. The guy bent his back into a position that made him look like a dolphin.  He said this position is particularly bad for the muscles of your back.

I suddenly had a flashback to the last sexual encounter with my wife. We decided to spice it up a little by bringing a standing mirror into the equation for improved viewing angles. With the mirror propped up at the end of the bed, the best position was easily her on top giving me the view of the ride. The only problem was, in order to see the full reflection, I had to left my head way up to see over her back. So there I was. Laying on my back like a dolphin watching her do all the work. 

The realization of what had actually caused this entire situation sent me into hysterics. I could not catch my breath from laughing so damn hard. My wife came running into the living room to see what was so funny. I explained to her that the mirror sex was what triggered the spasms.

As you can imagine, this service got really, really popular for an unspecified reason, so we are fairly busy. This sounds easy, it really usually involves hauling a weeks' worth of groceries around the store for hours on a big trolley that you have to pull by hand, and sometimes you're getting *two* or ***three*** people's groceries, so there's that.   


I always come in on time, but I am known for taking my legally mandated breaks late. This apparently is a cause for concern, according to my coworkers. Today, they basically forced me to take a break because I told them I'd been working for five hours straight.   


Now, my timeclock, whenever I thought I was ringing my break in, has said I haven't come into work for three weeks. This very not true, so I thought it must be a glitch, and that I would bring it up with my manager later.  


It was not. An older employee was trying to show me how to ring in my breaks, and lo and behold, the clock rejected me ringing in my break properly for the first time since I have begun working at this store. It was then that I thought, ""Hm, it would probably be a good idea to talk to my manager.""  


Me: Hey, is there any recorded record of employee's hours down here?  
Manager: Not really, but we have a guy that keeps tracks of that stuff.

Manager:Have you been clocking in?  
Me: Yeah?

t3_kkwda2,TIFU by making a 6 year old sit in the cold,"Obligatory, this happened about 5 years ago (obviously names changed). I was a freshman in high school at the time and for the most part, I was a great kid but had my fuck ups every now and then just like everyone else. My parents were going through a pretty ugly divorce and my mom had taken my phone away for months so my grandpa bought me one of those prepaid straight talk phones, so naturally it came with a new number. Fast forward to band class one day. I was sitting around all my buddies when a random number texts me saying something along the lines of
 ‚ÄúHey could you get Timmy tomorrow. I have a late meeting.‚Äù 
Me being the stupid kid I was, I thought this was a prime time for some good laughs with my friends. They agreed.
‚ÄúYes of course I‚Äôll be there.‚Äù 
Few days go by and I completely forget about the whole ordeal. I wake up to a text saying, roughly, ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre fucking funny?! I know exactly who you are and I will find you *insert my first and last name*‚Äù This woke me up immediately and I was scared shitless all day. He put my number through Facebook and my prepaid number was somehow linked with my Facebook already. School day goes by and when I get home, I get another text explaining what happened. Apparently my prepaid number belonged to the ex wife of timmys father. He sat outside of his local rec center, FOR 3 HOURS. This was in January and where I‚Äôm from the weather is not kind during the winter. It closed shortly after he was done there so no one checked up on him sitting out there. I still feel absolutely terrible for it and I wish I could make it up to him somehow. 

TL;DR: my freshman year I was an idiot and got a random text and played along with it. Ended up saying I would pick a child up from practice and he sat in the cold for hours.

So, wax is hot but I‚Äôm having trouble seeing my target because I‚Äôm a big girl and when I look straight down I see...well, I don‚Äôt see *that* so I‚Äôm kind of on tippy toes looking into the bathroom mirror. I gently slide the OH GOD DAMN THAT‚ÄôS HOT wax across my halibut white skin, taking care to just get a small area. Then it dripped off the end of the popsicle stick onto the forbidden zone. Ok, I can cut that out with a scissor, no worry. I slap the paper on there, brace myself with another drink and *riiiiiiiip* the paper off with no wax whatsoever. Is it too cool? I don‚Äôt know but let‚Äôs add more HOT HOT wax and paper right away. And then another drink and tear that sumbitch off in one yank. So now I‚Äôm bleeding in about 5 spots, sticky in 5 more and still mostly hairy. Plus I‚Äôm sweating profusely. I should get ice for my scotch so I duck waddle down a flight of stairs to the kitchen for ice and more scotch. 
Back in the bathroom to survey the damage. I look like I have lady mange. At the very least I need to even up the damage. Wax on the other side and PUUUUULLLLLLL. And now I‚Äôm crying, and I remember why I tip my esthetician so handsomely.

t3_kkw19p,TIFU by thinking I had hurt myself from having sex,"First, although sex is in the title, and many TIFUs have intimate details and sometimes seem like humble-brags, this is not one of those posts. That sex happened is important to the story, but that's it. You're not going to find anything more than the phrase ‚Äùvanilla sex‚Äù in here. If you're looking for sexy fun, try another post.

On to the story.

Currently, my wife and I do not have sex often. It's just where things are at the moment, no big deal. But last week, for whatever reason, my wife was more up for sex than usual.

So who am I to look a gift vagina in the mouth? (Ew, who says that?). So over the course of 4 days, we had pretty vanilla sex three times. We did not do anything crazy. We didn't use bondage equipment, we didn't whip out an inflated sheep, and to be perfectly honest, I doubt any season lasted more than 15 minutes.

The next day after the last session, I am sore. My lower back was sore, my abdomen was sore, just a lot ""down there‚Äù. I find it weird and a little depressing. But I also recognize that I am a very out of shape almost 50 year old guy, so maybe this is to be expected.

The next day (Sunday I believe) I still hurt. It hasn't gotten better. Next day, it's worse, and I take an Aleve for the pain 

On the third day I call in sick. Something is clearly not right, a muscle thing shouldn't get worse like this. My wife suggests I should go to Urgent Care.

This was my dilemma. Do I really want to go to Urgent Care? I didn't really want to go, not because of embarrassment, but because of the level of injury I thought I had vs what my state is dealing with right now 

Last I looked, my state has one of the worst numbers for Covid infections and deaths. All businesses are open, I think masks are only barely ‚Äùrecommended‚Äù, and it's just a clusterfuck. One of the major hospitals in my  town has suspended all elective surgeries until some time in January to keep beds open. I would not be surprised if that date gets extended. 

So I really didn't want to go. I suspect if I hadn't thought the injury was from something else, and if it wasn't the shit show that is 2020, I might have gone in earlier. But I did not. I told my wife if it was worse tomorrow I would definitely go to Urgent Care.

The next morning, as I roll out of bed screaming from the pain, I know where I am going next. I still think it's a weird muscle injury, but it is time to go.

I get to Urgent Care, and the guy taps around on my abdomen, and finds a specific spot on my right side that causes incredible pain every time he pokes it. He basically stops and says I need to go to the ER.

I go to the. ER, and although I was second in line, everything felt like it took forever. I am guessing they were low on beds, because I traveled from the common waiting room to various places (ct scan, admittance, and.. something else). Each time I got to shuffle back to the waiting room, slump down in a chair, and try to find a way to not be completely miserable.


At some point (things get real fuzzy here) I was told that my appendix needed to come out immediately. They get me in a bed, I sign all the forms, and off I go for my first operation ever 

When I come out of the operation, they tell me that my appendix had an abscess, was gangrenous, and was perforated (I am assuming the perforation was on removal, but I am no doctor)

I assumed this would be a two day thing. Surgery on Wednesday, out on Thursday. I get the impression that due to the state of my appendix, my recovery took much longer.

At one point I puked up black stuff - that was scary as hell. After that they stuck a tube down my nose, so that was fun. It is now Saturday (that's right, I spent Christmas here), and I am told I MAY get to go home tomorrow.

I feel that had I gone to Urgent Care DAYS earlier, I wouldn't be sitting here now so miserable.

TL:DR: Thought I hurt myself from sex, instead it was my appendix giving up on 2020 and trying to take me with it.",249,37,tifu
t3_kkvxca,TIFU By Atoning For My Aquarium Sins,"  

So I work a pretty demanding job and over the past like 3 months I haven‚Äôt really had much time to myself and the time I do get to myself I spend sleeping/recovering from the work week. So now that the year is coming to an end, my jobs most busiest time of year is coming to a close and I can finally begin cleaning up my neglected messes/chores one of them being my fish tanks. 

So I received a early Christmas present last month from my father and it was another fish tank, it was his way of saying ‚Äúquit bullshitting and clean up those fish tanks! They‚Äôre an eye sore‚Äù (Can‚Äôt blame him), cut to Thursday when all hell broke loose and the fish tank my dad gave me decided to just suddenly start leaking, thus ruining my plans of providing a new home for my current fish. 

So now cut to today when I decided to finally perform a water change on my oldest fish tank, about half the water in it had evaporated (Didn‚Äôt bother refilling it because well I was gonna move my fish to the new tank and drain the old tank but yeah‚Ä¶.). So I topped the tank off and began syphoning the water out of it so I could thoroughly clean the gravel in it because months of death and waste had built up and I didn‚Äôt want my fish to suffer anymore. I performed a 70% water change because the water was so foul and at the end my syphon head had a bunch of dead plant matter and gunk blocking it I figured it was a good place to stop so I began draining my syphon by lifting it up‚Ä¶ I had totally forgot my ceiling fan was running and the blades smacked my syphon thus sending nastiness all around my room and on my ceiling. It was as someone had taken a wet dump and decided to fling it all around my room. So yeah don‚Äôt be a shitty aquarium owner like myself and do your water changes often!

TL;DR TIFU by performing a very long due water change one my fish tank, and hitting my syphon head on my ceiling fan trying to drain it thus getting a mixture of dead plant matter, algae and fish poop splattered all on my ceiling and on my walls (Yeah I deserved that‚Ä¶)",14,5,tifu

Well, when we popped em out of the oven, like any other brownies, we let em cool. 

Fast forward 30 minutes, I try the first brownie. To feel out it‚Äôs effects before traumatizing my other family members.

So I waited about 90 minutes before eating another. Then decided by then it was fine for my mom to have one. Within another 30 minutes, I ate three more.

Long story short, my mom had 3 brownies. I had 5.

As I had almost given up and considered reaching for another, I start to feel them. 

We are JUST now feeling the first one kick in...

Now we are google searching about edibles, low-key freaking out in front of my little sisters.

So yeah, we shared half the pan of brownies.

How fucked are we?

Edit: 37 minutes later. I seriously can not move my legs. Everything suddenly got euphoric and deeply calming

Edit 2: 40 more minutes later. My thoughts are extremely abstract, and very vivid. This is my last update. I am seconds from falling in the floor and cannot believe I am typing this rn.

Edit 3: The next morning. I‚Äôd like to clarify that I followed a video that explained how to extract every molecule of THC and boost its potency. Many comments are assuming I meant an ounce, but no I just don‚Äôt have any tolerance and consumed some very well-followed directions on the tutorial which I will link below and am not affiliated with. 

The high was significantly different from smoking, and I have only started smoking a few months ago. This high hit very hard and gave me a tranquil feeling. I would have loved to listen to more music or walk around in a forest somewhere. Normal high me wants to have a fun conversation. This high felt deeply spiritual. Like something out of Avatar. I had no desire to talk at all.

It all started when I got a message on Steam (if you're not aware, it's a gaming platform), from a friend, asking for me to vote for his team on DOTA esports. Obvious phishing, I was well aware of that. So, as someone experienced enough to work as an IT, I was trying to figure out what they want to gain from this.

Website was a copy of another site. So, I have to ""vote"". So I hit ""Sign in with Steam"", and the window that pops up for you to log in via steam appears. I type in my details, 2FA to log in, all good so far. I vote. My friend blocks me.

Cue to today. 3:40 AM. I get a call, my account got hacked. I'm mystified. How? I logged in via steam. They can't access my friends list to repeat the same message from the steam log in. They only get my profile. So I check the website again. Go to Sign In with Steam. Window pops up. All legit, still. And then it hits me. The window that popped up, the small hint of loading that pops up when a browser window pops up. Perfect to the last pixel. It was never a browser window, but a frame that couldn't leave the browser.

t3_kku19e,TIFU by needing to pee,"I don't know if this qualifies, especially since it happened last year, before covid.  


My sister was getting married and my other sister and I, along with all their friends, showed up for the event. It wasn't a wedding, not a big one, just signing some documents and partying with close friends. That means lots of drinking, which I don't like doing but I go with the flow anyway cause I love my sisters.

So far, I both shock and impress my sisters' friends by drinking everything like it's water. I rarely drink, but I'm a big guy who eats a ton, so I can drink a ton and weather out the alcohol long enough so that everyone thinks it has no effect on me (very easy when everyone drinks on an empty stomach and get drunk on the first shot). That said, I still need to use the washroom.

After playing nonograms on my phone, I felt the need to empty out all fluids I've drank and I had no idea where the washroom was.

I get up and move to where I think it might be. The world is refusing to be still, but it barely bother's me, what does is that everyone is motion and it makes it hard to ask for directions. Then I see a single guy standing still. I walk up to him and ask him if he knows where the washroom is.

For some reason he got annoyed and ask ""Why are you asking me?""

I was confused, was it a bad thing to ask people for directions? Either way, I had a bladder to drain and I answer him, fully expecting it to explain my logic. Now, while I can make it look like alcohol doesn't do anything to me, truth is it does, I'm just better at weathering it out than most. So I answered without thinking about what I was saying, thinking it was better than saying I thought he was a staff member.

I said: ""Out of everyone, you look straight.""

Yes. I did not mean his preference, I meant that he was not wavy or moving, he was still. What I was incapable of thinking of the time is that he would not think along the same lines I was. 

Right away, he got angry, he started looking around, and looking like he wanted to kill someone. Thankfully, he decided to be the better person. 

I forget what he said exactly but he was stabbing me with his finger as he said something along the lines of ""I will help you, because I am a good person.""

At didn't understand why he was doing that or why he was being aggressive, but I smile and thank him and agree aloud that he is good person. He points me the washroom and I get sweet relief. 

It didn't hit me until the next day about what I did and I felt embarrassed.

Husband and I are back in his home town for the holidays. I proposed his brothers, mom, and us all go to lunch, and we did such. We‚Äôre all laughing and shit talking before the food comes out. We tell the family about the crazy land of Florida where they sell alcoholic milkshakes on the street! We got talking about dairy. I mention how my husband always gets farty whenever he has ice cream and sometimes cheese. It‚Äôs not terrible but I tolerate it because I love my husband. That was it.... This is what broke my husband... his mom said to him ‚ÄúYEAH!! You‚Äôre lactose intolerant. Until you turned 4, you would vomit after drinking whole milk. I would start giving you soy milk and just convinced you it was regular milk. That‚Äôs why you got to drink from you own special cartoon growing up‚Äù. 

Bells just start going off. His facial expression just went blank. He was kind blown. It was always something he suspected but something he widely blew off (this man is more stubborn than a god damn mule). I cook with SO much dairy from ice cream shakes to double cream fettuccine noodles (that was a rough night) to eating yoghurt sauce with Indian curries to just about anything dairy! I love cooking, and my husband loves eating! 

This man is 24 and didn‚Äôt know he is intolerant towards milk. His mom and brothers started dying, confessing how much my husband‚Äôs farts smells when he eats dairy. My husband still stood in shock! His mom just assumed he realized it with age but that was WRONG! 

My husband served in the military. When he was in boot camp, he was uncontrollably farty. So much, that his Drill Instructor made him breathe in his own fart as a lesson to get him to stop (this was a joke). He always felt bad for his bunk mate who got so many whiffs of his farts that came about his deep sleep. My husband had no clue why he always farted. It finally clicked in him... it was all the dairy in boot camp from milk and yoghurt! 

Update: He still will continue normal consumption with dairy. He‚Äôs a bit salty about finding out. Only one suffering is me.... oh the things we milk for love!

I've been at K's home with her parents since this pandemic has started and im still here today but that's not important. What's really important is that i yelled at the one person that i love most And i can't believe i would say all this shit to her. 

I come from a terrible home life which i won't get into but it's caused my self esteem and self worth to plummet as well as my anger issues getting worse and worse my self esteem is getting better but i still have outbursts this is important for later. 

So i had a fight with my friend R (16M) who is also K's best friend they've been through everything together and have rarely fought with eachother which i envy alot.

Me and K don't really fight but sometimes when we do it gets BAD. I mean it goes off to one time K going on a walk to cool off in the rain. 

K was talking to me about my anger and my ego (i tend to be prideful alot when i fight with someone which is my worst trait.) and was telling me ""OP your anger is frightening me. I feel like it's getting worse and worse with every argument you can't let your ego get in your way""

I was still pissed and told her ""why the hell does this have to do with my ego? Im glad of what type of person i am I don't wanna change anything."" 

K told me ""but your anger is causing issues which i could see bringing a bunch of future problems down the road do you wanna try and see if my mom can set you up with a therapist?"" 

I have a bad history with therapists as they never really helped me out that much or at all so i got furious at that point and told her ""i don't need a damn therapist im fine! You shouldn't try to force me to change if i don't wanna god damn do it! The K i know would support me and be happy with who i am right? Well it's clear your not being the K i love."" 

She nodded at me and the moment i realize how badly i snapped at her i looked at her face and saw her with tears in her eyes. She got up and left before i could say anything she closed the door. 

I get a text from her dad (him and K's mom were working that night) saying ""listen i know you don't have a good home life but that was really uncalled for with what you said you better hope she forgives you because i sure as hell won't until you make it up to my daughter."" 

I got texts from pretty much all my friends saying what a dickhead and inconsiderate asshole i am etc. I got hate for days and honestly i deserved it. 

After K got home from M's place (M is 17 and across the street) i gave her a big hug apologizing profusely crying on her shoulder etc. 

It was that time of month for her so i set her a warm bath and made cookies and watched her favorite anime with her she seemed to be happy with the day and I've also been seeing a nice therapist too because i felt guilty and wanted to give it a shot.

So yesterday being Christmas I had been cooking and cleaning since 7am and today I decided that I deserve an at home spa day. I got my eye mask ready, I turned on the heater in my bathroom to make it nice and toasty, I found some nice realxing music to put on, and I found a lovely little recipe online for a DIY epsom salt and peppermint essential oil body scrub. I tweaked  the recipe to add more peppermint oil because I wanted to smell extra pepperminty. Frankly, I was excited. 

I got in the shower and began using the body scrub. It was so nice. My skin was all tingley and it smelt amazing. Then for some really dumb reason I decided to put some under my arms. Then from some other really, really dumb reason I decided to take a whole fistful and put it on my lady bits, thighs, and butt. I began scubing my legs and the sensation in my armpits turns from pleasantly tingly to burning real fast. This is when it dawned on me what I'd done. I start frantically trying  to washing away the scrub under my arms when the feeling in my down under starts to intensify. 

Now the issue is if I put my arms down to try to wash away the scrub below the burn in my armpits is even worse so I have to keep my arms up but if I do that my burning bush is, well, still burning. Luckily I have one of those tubs that has a drain stopper that you just push down so in between screams I was able to get a cool bath going to sit down in while I kept my arms raised and under the shower water.

Even though I thoroughly checked it and they've never had contact with it.. Or that she couldn't recognize that it was Totoro? But who hasn't seen Totoro when you mention Miyazaki films and talk about Kiki's Delivery Service? I don't even necessarily mean who hasn't seen the movie. I haven't even seen it. But who at least doesn't recognize it?

I am very glad I remain anonymous and pray my department coworkers don't tell her it was me. I made the personal decision to never speak to her again out of shame.

TLDR: Gave a secret santa a Totoro plushie, apparently she's allergic to cats and hates it.",8,16,tifu
t3_kks6g3,TIFU By Getting rid of my son's Christmas gifts because I thought he opened them early.,"So about a week ago I had finished my Christmas shopping and had wrapped my son's Christmas presents from me and his family and he looked super excited. But 2 days before Christmas I saw a tear on one of the gifts. (A ps4) and I asked him why he looked at his gifts early he told me it wasn't him and I told him if he stopped lying he could keep some of his gifts but I was gonna put the rest of the  away for next year. He pleaded with me not to do it and told me it wasn't him. I was fed up and hated that my own son was lying to me. So I sent most of his presents back to his family members (grandma aunt uncle ect) and yesturday he just looked in anger and he yelled at me saying. ""I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T LOOK AT THEM"" I sent him to his room all day and only let him out for lunch and dinner. Then comes earlier today I see a big rat running around the Christmas tree and see it nibbling in one of the candy canes. I the. Put 2 and 2 together and realize that tear could have been the rat. So here I am now scrambling to get my kids gifts back and buying rat traps on amazon. 


Update: So I called my family and managed to get all of the gifts back. I surprised him with them and apologized for not believing him. He was excited as he opened his ps4 and I even told him to make up for all this. I had ordered him a Nintendo switch. He almost lost his mind.

t3_kks0t4,TIFU by flooding by basement with my sisters toilet water,"sit down and get a glass of water for this amazing story

basically i was completely home alone with my sister, my mom was in a different city and my dad was in a store far away, (my sister is 6) and i decided to show her how to play peggle on the xbox because she‚Äôd like it

so i started showing her around and how to play, she was having fun and after abt 10 minutes she told me she had to pee

so i just told her to ‚Äúok just go, there‚Äôs a toilet 10 feet away‚Äù

but the thing is, she was so amazed by peggle that she held her pee for song long, she legitimately couldn‚Äôt walk

so i took her by the shoulders and carried her to the toilet, while she was leaving a trail of piss like the memphis belle bombing run on the way there

finally she got on the toilet, and she starts screaming and crying, so i grab some toilet paper and start mopping up her piss off the floor

she then decides it would be a great idea to strip all of her clothes off, and put them on the floor 

eventually i get about 1/3rd of it clean and i put the toilet paper in the toilet, and i flush it, (all while my sister is standing in the corner, completely naked and crying and screaming)

but then the toilet water starts rising, so i think ‚Äúoh no i clogged it‚Äù so i plunged it and flushed it again, but this time it kept rising and rising and rising

at this point water starts dripping out and i can feel my face getting more red, it eventually engolfes the piss on the floor, and anything else that might be in the bathroom and my sister continues screaming

suddenly the floor of the bathroom is completely covered by a full inch of piss-water

at this point i panic and run upstairs and get paper towel, my naked screaming sister chases after me and keeps saying ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt tell dad about me peeing he‚Äôll be so mad‚Äù 

also just saying my sister also lives with my grandparents (it‚Äôs a long story) and they‚Äôre not exactly very hard on her, if she steals something they‚Äôll cuddle her and tell her not to feel bad

my dad doesn‚Äôt physically hurt any of us (duh) but if we do something extremely wrong his lectures can be terrifying, and this isn‚Äôt the first time our sister has peed herself this years (keep in mind she is six years old, and theirs no excuse) so he was bound to be angry

ANYWAYS, so i am sitting in the piss water, trying to mop it all up with paper towel, and i tell my sister to get the home phone so i can call my dad, 

she starts running up the stairs, when i hear an loud CRASH, followed by even louder bloodcurdling screams

she fell down the fucking stairs, butt naked, covered in piss

fuck my life

my ears start ringing and i pick her up, trying to sooth her and i plop her down on her bedroom, and tell her to get changed, and i call my dad, all while i can hear my sisters begging screeches in the background

and i thought that was the end of it, but it wasn‚Äôt

fast forward about 30 minutes my sister is changed, we are downstairs and it seems like most of the water mysteriously disappeared and things calmed down, she stopped crying and things are going well

then my dad gets home and i tell him the whole story, he starts yelling at my sister because he‚Äôs fed up with her peeing herself so much, after a few minutes of him yelling

he tells her to put her clothes in the laundry room

now remember how i said that the water ‚Äúmysteriously disappeared‚Äù?

well it turns out it leaked under the fucking wall, and aaaaaaaall that water went into the laundry room, the bottom of the wall is damp and you can literally pull the drywall off

it was in the clothes on the floor, the freezer, the laundry machine, absolutely everything

and to top it all off the lights won‚Äôt turn on, and the outlets aren‚Äôt working

and that brings to be the current moment, i‚Äôm sitting on the damp laundry room floor with my cat, listening to my dad yell at my sister upstairs,  while i type this post out

fuck

tldr: the toilet overflowed and the bathroom got flooded with my sisters piss water, only for us to discover even more piss water in the laundry room,",6,7,tifu
t3_kkrw43,TIFU by destroying my GF's family's precious memories on Christmas,"Actually happened about 12 hrs ago... so kinda today.

I finally met GF's family yesterday on Christmas, complete with a matching grandmother accessory. Everything went well for dinner, board games, etc. Until my girlfriend's sister said that I should see some embarrassing photos from her childhood. That ended up becoming an hour long stroll down memory lane with a ton of their old photos from 20-25 years ago.

I was doing very well, her dad even said I was ""alright"" which apparently is by far the biggest compliment he's ever given any guy either girl has brought home, but then I fucking ruined it. I was incredibly nervous and wanted to make a good impression, so I accepted everything they offered like a good guest. Well.... her mother brought me a glass of water and you can probably see where this is going.

I took a sip and in a moment of pure agony I set it down at an angle... which caused a full cup of water to pour out onto the kitchen table... which was covered in a few hundred photographs from their family album...

I yelled ""I'M SO SORRY!!"" and ran to get paper towels but some definitely got soaked. Their mom assured me it was completely fine, even after I wiped it up, but I still feel like they all probably hate me now.... Her mom said this morning that I seemed like a nice guy, but I just hope that I can live it down at some point...

t3_kkr8hi,TIFU by making my boyfriend laugh during a romantic bath together,"Obligatory this didn't happen today but last week. 

I hadn't seen my boyfriend in a month because of quarantining. I stayed away until it was safe to come around again and thought ""let's do something special"". That special thing was a bath together in his giant tub. We get in, I throw some epsom salt in there, get a little bubbles going, and we both get into our respective comfy spots.

I'm trying to enjoy the quiet peaceful moment as I feel the stress melt slowly out of me and he's being a disturber of peace, goofing around. I'm slightly irritated by this after a long week, and just want a few minutes of quiet. 

Then suddenly he says ""oh no"". The way he says it gets my attention and I ask what. He says it's nothing, but starts laughing. I tell him if he farts in this bath tub I will drown him. About 40% of our relationship is laughing at farts and similar humor, so this makes him laugh more. He's telling me not to make him laugh and I'm further arguing my point of imminent fucking doom if I see a single bubble.

I've abandoned peace at this point and given into his shenanigans, just going along with the humor of it but also disgusted. I had faith in this stupid man's sphincter and his ability as an adult to hold it. This was my fuck up. We're both laughing, I'm still a little annoyed at the ruined moment of peace, so I tell him to just get out of the tub and go fart in the next room.

I forget what I said, but as he was rising out of the water, I said something funny. Now picture a grown naked man trying to get out of a bathtub. I'm in the fetal position sitting down trying to give him space to maneuver, so I'm in ground zero, when suddenly I guess he laughed too hard. The first offence was like a startled duck, and the fact one slipped out only made him laugh harder, so it was a series of laugh-farts that sounded like ducks getting trampled on. This wasn't even a small, normal fart, this was a torrent of undiagnosed IBS, refusal to accept lactose intolerance, and poor life choices.

I was in shock at this point. I get out of the bathtub with haste, and we're both crying laughing. He's still in the tub holding onto the curtain absolutely losing it, and I'm trying to gather my things as fast as possible to run to the other end of the house like a freshly bathed cat. But bathed in fart. I was pissed but couldn't stop laughing and that's when I smelled it. You know how if you fart in the shower, the steam makes it smell worse? Yes. And I couldn't hold my breath because I was laughing so hard, so each time I inhaled I was attacked by steam-in-the-bag fart. I start gagging and I know I need to leave before I vomit so I run in just a towel across the house, hoping no one decided to come home early. 

He apologized and we occasionally giggle about it, but other than that I have no idea how to end this story. 

TLDR: Boyfriend and I took a bath together, I made him laugh too hard, and he pretty much farted on me while trying to get out of the tub.

Edit: Thank you everyone who gave me an award. And to all the people who wish he shat upon me - I rebuke thee.",3632,89,tifu

We get it all loaded up, I'm driving the SUV with the furniture and my spouse is driving our other vehicle (my usual car) with the kids. I got about 30 minutes of kid free time so I put on some celebrity podcast. The dude happens to be discussing a movie where he had to do a prolonged sex scene and it ended being 8 hours of making out, breast fondling and ass grabbing. Along with pretending to go down on his female counterpart.

My spouse's car is old so I'm just listening through my phone speaker when it cuts out. I get annoyed thinking my data plan killed the app and try figuring it out. But it's still going. I stop and start, it starts playing again no problem. A few minutes later it cuts out again. Minute or two later I get it started again. It cuts out after 3 minutes but the light turned green so I couldn't look at it and give up.

A moment later my phone starts ringing and it dawns on me. It's cutting out every time I'm behind my spouse at a red light. My spouse is calling ""Please stop, just please stop! It's all ass and titties up in here talking about panties and eating out and grabbing things. And how the f do you change this to the damn radio?!""

My aunt, who is very religious (Anglican: this comes back) and I have both been watching ""The Crown"". She recommend it to me any I've been enjoying it a lot. So I thanked her for the recommendation. She then asked if there's anything similar on Netflix. I wanted to recommend ""Victoria"" because it's also about the British Royal family but that's on Showmax. The next thing in the genre I could think of was ""The Tudors"". Now my aunt is generally decent and ""The Tudors"" has a sex scene or  three in every episode! I  didn't think of it like that when we were talking about it so I tried to sell it based on ""it's about the start of the Anglican church"" thinking that this might catch her attention.   I'm part of the generation who waited up on a Sunday evening to watch the latest episode of GOT and while the explicit sex wasn't my favorite part of the show, it made me immune.  Also, I hardly notice it because I spend a lot of time on my phone while watching series but my aunt is one to actually watch a show and now I've exposed her to boobies and doggy-style in a show where I emphasized the story about the church!

t3_kkqmff,TIFU by getting my relatives drunk.,"So this is my first Reddit post. I remembered this story and thought that this would be the best place to share it.

I‚Äôm using mobile, so sorry for typos etc.

We had some relatives around for Christmas when I was 12. I didn‚Äôt really know them very well but knew that they were highly religious. They were devout Salvationists. 12 year old me didn‚Äôt know much about this denomination of Christianity. I assumed that they would have similar beliefs to others. My mum said before they arrived that they can‚Äôt have a drop of alcohol as it was against their beliefs. 

So we sat around the dining room table and had some dinner. I minded my p‚Äôs and q‚Äôs and tried to be very polite and well mannered. 

After dinner my mum asked me to get some trifle for everyone. (This is where I messed up) I made the trifles earlier in the day and they looked pretty much the same. The only difference between them was that one had half a bottle of Sherry in it.  I grabbed the first one without thinking and served up several large helpings and gave it out. Everyone raved about how lovely it tasted. I was thanked for making it and continued on my day without thinking much more about it. 

I went to my room for a while and then went back to see my family.  Well... you could certainly tell that my visiting relatives were pissed as skunks! They were slurring their words and singing jollily. My mum took me to one side and asked which trifle I‚Äôd served up. I told her it was the one in front. I‚Äôd given them the one with all of the booze in!

They all had terrible hangovers after and I‚Äôm probably going to burn for it.

t3_kkq5ft,TIFU by asking an African-American woman if she was getting foodstamps.,"This happened a few years ago but still makes me cringe thinking about it. When I worked in retail, I always made sure to make sure the customer had a satisfactory visit to the store and whatnot. Many times I'd been told that people left anonymous surveys thanking me for my kind service. Now to get to the fuckup. As a cashier, every now and then a customer will do an EBT transaction that includes purchases for things like foodstamps and stuff. Overtime, I'd become very comfortable with how to complete that particular transaction. One day while monitoring the self-checkout area, I saw a customer having some difficulty with a card transaction. On the screen I saw ""EBT"" and said something like, ""You're getting foodstamps? I can help you with that transaction."" Since a majority of the time when doing the EBT transaction at the register, customers usually were using foodstamps. So I guess my mind just assumed foodstamps while on autopilot. After that, the customer told me that that was such a stereotypical thing to ask her or something like that and was really offended. At first I was confused, then my unintentional fuck up immediately hit me. I think she assumed that I saw that she was African-American and was thus getting foodstamps or something like that.  Apologizing didn't seem to help. So I couldn't do anything but awkwardly walk away after it became clear that she didn't want to speak with me anymore.

I had just a few local friends come over for the holiday since we all couldn't travel - we drank, ordered in, watched a movie, and caught up. After a couple people left, the only people still here was myself, my roommate, and one of our best guy friends. I had been bothering him for a while to show him something nerdy on my computer and finally convinced him to stick around for a bit more. He took a moment to go to the bathroom, my roommate went to her room to start getting ready for bed, and I went to my room to turn on my computer. It was a really windy night, so before he came back, I went to step on my end table to close the upper part of my window - a move that I have done at least a dozen times before and knew one day it would be my literal downfall.

I stepped too close to the edge and fell really hard to the floor. I was shocked mostly and started to scramble to try to get up. My roommate ran into my room screaming ""OMG what happened"", and I was like ""yeah, no, nothing, all is fine, just fell"". I got to my knees and elbows finally, looked at her, then looked down to the floor to see all of my sex toys, handcuffs, and condoms spread everywhere. I surprise Pikachu faced and then scurried to push everything under my bed screaming ""\[FRIEND\] CAN'T SEE THIS, THIS IS WEIRD"". Just after cleaning up the water that spilled from my end table humidifier as well, friend came into the door and I went to the computer to continue showing him nerd things. Five minutes later, he looks over to the end table and asks ""what happened here?"". I say ""oh nothing, don't worry about it"" and then look over and see that right where the front of my first drawer should be is one single condom precariously placed at the edge staring out at us. I brushed it off and he eventually left.¬†

The next morning I woke up with bruises all down the right side of my body. I'm not a stranger at all to sex talk and jokes, but was not prepared for this kind of drunk and impromptu ""show and tell"" alone with this friend.¬†He's also an avid Reddit user, so friend - if you see this - shoot me a text and laugh at me.¬†

t3_kkomyg,"TIFU by getting a tonsillectomy, eating a chicken pot pie, &amp; popping laxatives like Christmas candy","Little backstory for y‚Äôall... I had my tennis ball sized tonsils removed on December 16th after years of having a compromised immune system and constantly being sick. Specialist after specialist and not a soul could figure out why so the next best guess was that my tonsils were just way too big (which they were(doc even said that after 20+ years he had never seen a set so big)), but I wouldn‚Äôt be here right now if that was the correct solution. The tonsillectomy went great and I was able to go home the same day and pretty much slept for 5 days straight so I honestly don‚Äôt remember being in a lot of pain or eating much. The 22nd came around and my stomach started HURTING, like 7/10 I‚Äôm either getting stabbed repeatedly in the gut and/or I‚Äôm about to shit myself pain. I realized I hadn‚Äôt pooped since my surgery but I figured it was either because I hadn‚Äôt eaten enough to produce anything or because between the combo of pain pills and anesthesia I was constipated. So, I sent my boyfriend to the store to get me a frozen chicken pot pie and the strongest laxatives he could find. I popped that bad boy in the microwave and popped the maximum dose of laxatives in my mouth, washing it down with the pot pie. This is where things started to get messy. About 30 minutes after eating the pot pie and taking the poop pills, my stomach started to turn and I got (way too) excited. I decided to get a running start to the bathroom that was upstairs because I knew that once it fully kicked in I wasn‚Äôt going to make it up those stairs without turning the carpet brown. Once I got up there I realized that things were about to come out the opposite end from what I was expecting...yup that‚Äôs right...I started projectile vomiting everywhere with my still freshly butchered throat and lack of tonsils. After 30 minutes of this, my bathroom and myself were covered in blood, sweat, tears, and thrown up chicken pot pie, but my stomach still had that knife stabbing pain. I felt the urge to make a bm so I finally move my butt to the seat of the thrown and start pushing like I‚Äôm giving birth to triplets, but nothing is coming out. Like n o t h i n g is coming out. At this point I‚Äôm sitting on the toilet and throwing up into a bucket with my throat torn open and my butt sealed shut. Long story short, this goes on until the 24th, but with increasingly worse pains and more laxatives in my system. I finally have my boyfriend take me to the emergency room because at this point I‚Äôm worried that something is seriously wrong and that I‚Äôm gonna breath my last breath sitting on a(n empty) toilet bowl. After running a few tests and scans, I was diagnosed with salmonella poisoning (from the damn pot pie) and drum roll please........... crohn‚Äôs disease!!!! Doc told me that taking laxatives for either of those conditions is the WORST thing you can do, but to have taken 3x the max dose and to have BOTH of the diagnoses was by far the absolute worst thing I could have done to my body. And to put the topper on the tree, my compromised immune system is probably due to the crohn‚Äôs disease rather than the now gone tonsils. Here I am, on the day after Christmas, still on the toilet with minimal progress. I even opened my Christmas presents while sitting on the toilet. 

TLDR; thought I was constipated but I just had food poisoning and Crohn‚Äôs disease so I took way too many laxatives and my boyfriend got me one of those old people squishy toilet seats for Christmas",7,2,tifu

I had my pockets full of money (5's, 10's and a few 20's my parents gave my brother and I to go have fun, buy a few of these eggs from the many sellers in the streets and get lunch.) We were not to spend too much but had enough just in case. I was full from breakfast in the morning and had a few napkins in my pocket as well. As I walked past a trash can I felt like it would be a good idea to get all the trash I was carrying around into the can so I didn't dump it all back home.

I forgot about the money I had as well. I threw about $50-$60 without looking because the bills just felt like the napkins in my hands when it was just wadded up with the rest of the trash. Whoops. As I ran back up to my parents and got ready to leave, I hear ""Looks like you had fun, do you have my change?"" Uhhhhhhhhhhh.......

Needless to say the rest of the day was not so fun, but it's a funny memory to look back on. I hope some garbage man had a good day that day.

t3_kkpbom,TIFU by using an airplane bathroom,"Obligatory this happened about 4 years ago, but I figured it belonged here.

So as a child (up until the age of about 6) my parents would take us from the cold northeast to Florida for a mini vacation every year, but that was the only time I had been on a plane before I was 15. I don't even remember those plane rides. So, I'm 15, starting to look into colleges, and my dad decides we should fly to some schools to go see the campuses. I said cool! Let's go! So, we're on this plane, about 2 hours into a 4.5 hour flight, and I have to pee. Okay, that's fine, bathroom is only a few rows up. I get up, make my way to the vacant bathroom, open the door. I go in, shut and lock the door behind me, and sit down to pee. At least I thought I locked the door. I'm mid pee, when the door swings open (on its own free will), and I'm suddenly staring into the eyes of a 30-something year old man WHILE peeing. He says nothing. I say nothing. Luckily the plane bathrooms are small enough I can just reach out and pull the door closed and ACTUALLY lock it. Finish up, get out of there as swiftly as possible, didn't even tell my dad what had happened. Traumatized.

&amp;#x200B;

Since that day, I have never used an airplane bathroom, and the funny thing is, I now attend one of those colleges that a 4.5 hour flight away, so I fly quite a bit.

t3_kkp6gz,TIFU by making my sister think she got a crappy Xmas gift,"So me (31f) and my (27f) sister wanted to do a little joke on my other sister (27f) (yeah they are twins)

So to give you a bit of background and the players.
We have sister A (the one doing the joke with me)
Sister T (who was the victim of the joke)
Me

Sister T loves tagging us on random memes on FB and it's all fun and games and we have a long running story on some tags. But she recently tagged us on a meme saying: now Xmas is coming close I realize I really really appreciate and love my sister and that she is an incredible girlfriend.. naah just kidding ''She stinks'

So back to our little joke.. due to that tag we decided to turn the tables around on her and as a joke we bought some deodorant and clothing pins. We put them under the tree as 'gifts' although we included another meme..

Now in our family the kids get the presents from under the tree and distribute them, the order is from youngest to oldest. So instead of getting my sister her original gift, they first give her the joke gift and because my stupid ass put on another meme she didn't connect the dots, so she didn't find it funny at all. She even thought that that was all she would get.

I don't blame her, I fucked up the joke. But I apologized profusely and told her what was going and and she got her original gift right away. But damn I felt bad about it.

Afterwards we could laugh about it.. but yeah not gonna try that again.

Tldr; I almost ruined Xmas by doing a crappy joke on my sister, she got sad, then we made up and laughed about it.",1,0,tifu
t3_kkp41h,TIFU by looking like an idiot at the gym,"This happened last night but anyways, I was doing leg day cuss I need to add some girth to the buns and legs. Now I haven‚Äôt gone to the gym consistently for about a month and a half because of personal issues and being out in the field, so I‚Äôd say disregarding that I‚Äôm not on my usual physical endurance was my first mistake. I started with deadlifting and I‚Äôm still where I‚Äôm at, hitting 335 and I go on to squatting. I kind have always struggled with squatting but not to where it‚Äôs worrisome. My personal best on squat is 295 which is a little concerning. Anyways I hit 135 for a couple sets and I move on to two plates each side (225). My second mistake was not putting on clamps to keep the plates from moving. I go for it and my body just seems to not accept it, I‚Äôm struggling and it‚Äôs tilting on the right side and I see the plates falling. I maintain control and I‚Äôm like ok I gotta rack this before I look stupid. And when I rack it, and I‚Äôm thinking it racked properly, only one side was racked, and down goes the plates and then the other side falls and I‚Äôm just there looking extremely awkward for looking like that one guy in the gym. I have never felt so embarrassed in my life.
Moral of the story, use clamps even if you can hit the weight your doing.

To keep things brief, I work 12 hour overnight shifts and am a zombie most of the time. Being in a relationship with my wonderful girlfriend I often take an hour or couple hour nap to live a day life with her on days off. My fuck up. 
I had planned a very romantic night: candles, rose pedals, wine, dinner, warm bath... major boyfriend points right here. All this obviously lead to the bedroom. Fast forward a couple rounds and it being 2 am. I have been awake for far to long and starting to fall asleep as we kiss and cuddle. I close my eyes briefly and in that moment start dreaming of work, specifically of an encounter with a coworker, Mike. 
My girlfriend is being flirty, cute, cuddle bug on me and I blurt out, ‚ÄúMikes a cool guy‚Äù as she‚Äôs mid feeling me up and probably wanting another round.

t3_kkojd9,TIFU by using body wash as moisturizer,"So this all started 3 days ago when I asked my mom to get me new shampoo, body wash and moisturizer. My skin was feeling pretty dry and I was feeling really uncomfortable. A few hours later, I walked in the bathroom and 2 brand-new bottles were sitting on the counter. So in a rush, I took the bottle that had the word ""moisturize"" on it and spread the contents all over my body. The first day I applied it, I had no issues.

But next morning, I woke up and I had these rashes around the creases of my elbows and my ballsack felt odd, but I thought nothing of it. I assumed it was just the moisturizer doing its work, so I applied the moisturizer again all over my body. And when I say all over my body, I mean everywhere. All the nooks and crannies, all the corners. You name it; it was moisturized.

I woke up the next day and I immediately felt this weird pain in my scrotum, and then I looked down and saw this monstrosity of a ballsack that looked like a leather bag made from the skin of a crocodile. The skin was so dry, it looked like my balls traveled to space without a spacesuit. Every time I moved, I could feel my rigid skin trying to fold itself and it hurt. 

At this point, I knew something was wrong, so I told my mom to never buy this moisturizer again because my balls were allergic to it. But then she said ""What moisturizer? I didn't buy a moisturizer."" Then it dawned on me. There were only two bottles sitting on my bathroom counter back then. I went back to my bathroom to look at the bottles and one bottle turned out to be a shampoo and the other was a body wash that proudly explains that it moisturizes and hydrates your skin. I had been using a body wash as a moisturizer for the past 3 days.

TL;DR: Used body wash as moisturizer, made balls dry and painful.",19,17,tifu
t3_kko6c7,TIFU by completely trashing my downstairs bathroom.,"A break from the obligatory ""didn't happen today"" posts- this happened 5 minutes ago. Should be using a throwaway but I have a bad short term memory and probably will have forgotten half of this by the time I'm done making it. Also sorry for most likely bad English. It's my first language but I'm still on an adrenaline rush or most likely just dumb.

To get some backstory, I live with my parents, and when I was younger, when I went to the bathroom which has a history of being...larger then normal, we kind of had our own version of the ""poop knife"" but instead we used a hanger. We'd call it the one and only ""hangertime"". My parents used to break up the turd using said hanger (different one every time) but as I got older I started doing it myself. My grandmother also owned this grabber type thing that helped her reach tall stuff, and I got it when she passed. (Wasn't exactly a heirloom I guess, she liked to call it one, but it was important to her for whatever reason so she wanted to give it to me so take that how you want) So now into the story.

I pretty much anticipated that it was gonna be pretty big but when I actually looked it ended up being way bigger then I thought, and I was a little worried it may brake the hanger but I shoved that aside and got to, as I so lovingly call it, ""hangering"".

I broke it up into small pieces like normal, but for some reason this one section just refused to break and just kept stalling and bending said hanger to the point it was breaking. Eventually it just gave and crap water just splashed EVERYWHERE. All over my pajama pants, all over my feet, on the floor, etc. I stand there in shock for a minute before standing on my pointes (I do ballet and for those who don't know it's a position where you stand on the very tips of your toes) and attempt to wash my feet and legs with hot water and soap in the sink before stripping my pants off. I'm usually a pretty carefree person, but my serious/mature mode kicked in faster than you could blink your eyes. I live in close quarters with 2 other houses, not to mention there is an insane amount of traffic that drives by my house all the time so this just adds to the nightmare I'm already dealing with. (I'm female in case anyone wondered) I do what I need to do, considering my options briefly, before running to the downstairs closet, grabbing aforementioned grabber from my grandma, and run to the bathroom with it. I figured emotions could kick in later, possibly Karma, for what was about to take place. I knew it wasn't exactly smart but when you're standing in your underwear covered in crap water you aren't thinking about heirlooms, feelings, rationality, the like. I pick up the turd pieces with it and discard of them in store bag which is dripping into the sink. I am now in a pose reminiscent of Twister attempting not to break my feet from standing on the tips of them for so long, and not to mention they're WET. (I was in this position for about 25+ minutes in bare feet and I'm hardly even to that level in Ballet yet) So as I'm wobbling around attempting not to go face-first into the toilet, I flush the remaining toilet paper and pee, throwing the grabber and broken, poopy hanger into the store bag. I'm just thankful that I don't necessarily believe in life after death, otherwise my grandma would've been making some plans to make sure I never went to Heaven for this crappy betrayal. I pulled the flusher, relieved and ready to be released of my painful pose.

I thought I was home free, but every good horror story has a sequel.

It doesn't flush. It doesn't clog either. It just doesn't do anything. It's just sitting there, completely still, mocking me in all it's glory.

I grab the dripping bag out of the sink AGAIN, ready to start swearing out loud as I pull the toilet paper out of the toilet and throw the bag into the sink. Luck decided to be on my side this time (where were you before?) And it FINALLY flushed. I still wasn't done though. I, in my underwear, hoping and praying to God that someone wouldn't come knocking or driving by at this shameful moment, ran across my basement into my washroom, (open windows everywhere, no blinds shut) threw my wet pants in the washer, threw open the dryer door, and grabbed a warm pair of unsoiled pants which I changed into in a room conjoined to the bathroom, with even more open windows.

I probably washed the floor, my hands, legs and feet for an hour after that in poses reminiscent of Twister.

Never.
Again.



TL;DR, I attempted to break up a humongous turd with a heirloom from my grandma and a hanger, which broke, sending crappy water all over the floor and all over me. This results in me running across the house in my underwear, and standing in a professional ballet pose I'm hardly able to do for 25+ minutes.

t3_kknu1h,TIFU by celebrating Halloween in a country that doesn‚Äôt celebrate Halloween,"Obligatory this didn‚Äôt happen today, but rather 17 years-ish ago.

So as the headline mentions, I live in a country that doesn‚Äôt celebrate Halloween. Now being that some of my friends and I grew up in the US and Halloween is an awesome holiday, we throw a big party every year and invite everyone we know. It‚Äôs always a blast.

A year before said party took place, a few people tried to get it on in my dad‚Äôs room, and I had to kick them out feeling very uncomfortable with the situation. So, learning from past experiences, we set up a nice cozy bed in the basement, and lit some candles for a romantic atmosphere.

Cut to the party.

We‚Äôre all having a great time. There were some awesome costumes. One of my friends dressed up like a zombie, but since his GF‚Äôs sister was a professional makeup artist, it looked pretty bad ass.

Suddenly, we see flames coming out the small basement window. Apparently, one of the candles was directly below a very-flammable sleeping bag.

Now, if a fire about to burn down my house wasn‚Äôt bad enough, the flames were also growing extremely close to my old army bag, which also held a few mags of live ammo.

My zombie-dressed friend was the fastest to react. He ran down to the basement and extinguished the flames with an old carpet. That was the end of that.

The party continued and we were all getting good and drunk. So when my friend kept saying that his hands kinda hurt, we laughed it off. After a while, we realized his hands were badly burned and he really needed medical care. Luckily, I lived very close to a hospital so no one had to drive.

This would be a good time to note that at the time this story happened, terrorist bombings were part of our ever day life. So when my friend came in, ripped up ‚Äúbloody‚Äù clothes and way-too-realistic zombie makeup on, the whole hospital freaked out thinking there was another attack. Nobody thought about Halloween, because no one here celebrates Halloween. When they ran to him, asking him if he was ok and what happened, he just showed them his hands and said that he burned them. They were very confused.

tl;dr ‚Äì had a Halloween party in a country that doesn‚Äôt celebrate Halloween, almost burned down my house with a candle, a friend who had professional zombie makeup on put out the flames, we took him to the hospital because he burnt his hands and his costume freaked the whole hospital out because I live in a country that used to have a lot of terrorist attacks.",18,4,tifu

There I strode upon the halls
The cum still dripping from my balls
Her robe about me, the ends won't meet
My dick is out, I reveal my heat

Brave I was for the need to piss
No thoughts would delay the jist
And just about I made the corner
The roommate reveals herself, no chance to warn her

""My apologies, this robe don't fit""
I mutter out, but my cock don't quit
With the greatest fear in her eyes
She cry's out ""I'm just sorry for your size""

So here I wallow, pretending to shit
Unable to be seen because of it
Does it mean I was big and tall?
Or am I surprised I am so small?

t3_kkn6mb,TIFU by not using safety equipment,"Obligatory this didn't actually happen today. Funny starts in paragraph 3. Warning, kinda gross 

In the last years of the 1900s I ran a candy store in a mall in Oklahoma. We also had a drink tower with Coke and we sold novelty gifts like Beanie Babies. It was part of a local chain and a decent job for a young single guy with no degree. I get in to work one day and the owner has sold his stores; the new owner is a company whose VP is doing an inventory. 

The next day VP tells me he fired the exterminator because we have roaches. I kept the store clean and the exterminator came by twice a month but there was much I didn't know. If you've seen one, you have hundreds evidently. So he sends me to Home Depot with petty cash for some boric acid, but before I leave he tells me the best places to put it. (He was educated on the subject but neglected to mention a need for protective equipment.) The main focus was under the drink tower as one drop of Coke syrup can sustain a rather large roach family, so I crawled into this cabinet and start laying down boric acid. It's a very fine powder, like baby powder, but I don't stop to think that it might be floating around in the small enclosed area where I'm breathing it into my mouth, because I was young and invincible. 

On the way home I grab a BBQ sandwich, then I sit down to watch The Simpsons. After a minute I feel a gurgling in my belly so I go take a dump. It's aggressive but meh whatever. Back to Simpsons but wait, guess I wasn't finished. This time it's worse, like chocolate pudding from a firehose. Stomach cramping and the smell of death lead me to believe it's about to get bad but it was worse than I thought. After my legs fell asleep I, sweating, emerge from the bathroom to go watch... Wait no back in. (I later learned that boric acid kills roaches by making them poop and puke until they die so maybe a warning would have been nice!) 

All told I crapped 13 times in 2 hours. I know what you're thinking, that's not possible, nobody has that much poop in them, and you're not entirely wrong. Eventually you run out. And that's when I discovered anal dry heaves.

TL;DR didn't use safety equipment poisoning roaches, poisoned myself and spent hours pooping so hard that my body kept trying even after I was empty. Very painful.",14,3,tifu

My family and I celebrated our Thanksgiving and Christmas all in one due to COVID. So once I ate my plump of Turkey is when KFC started knocking on the back door. When I say it was knocking I mean it was GOING BALLISTIC ON THAT BACK DOOR. I prayed for my toilets survival. 

Colonel Sanders was going round for round with me and each time I lost. This continued periodically for most of the night until the wee morning hours.

t3_kkmclz,TIFU by nearly killing my dog on Christmas and going to the emergency vet,"My wife and I bought our first home last year. The backyard was spacious but needed a lot of work. One issue was an old split rail fence that needed replacing since it had been infested with termites.

We prioritized having the fence replaced in summer 2020 and then we were going to immediately adopt a dog. However, due to covid-19, the fence company we picked was busy as hell and we got scheduled for September. This left me plenty of time to clear all the foliage around the perimeter of the property. This would save me a lot of money. Almost everything I needed to clear was invasive honeysuckle which my state has encouraged homeowners to get rid of on sight.

I cleared the fence line and ended up in a silly property line dispute with a neighbor. Despite that setback, we did eventually move forward with the fence and it was installed in mid September. We adopted a very shy Aussie/German Shepherd mix named Juniper.

The dog had lots of issues to work through, including a reluctance to do solo exploration of its new yard. After months of work, we finally got her to go into the yard alone and explore on her own. Finally - a dog that would go sniff all the things and play with all the sticks!

There was just one problem. She kept getting diarrhea. Just when we thought we'd resolved it, it came back. It felt like she had diarrhea more often than she didn't. I was at my wit's end and I was really tired of cleaning that nastiness up. We had a baby in November so my wife was busy nonstop and that meant all dog care fell to me. Ugh.

Fast forward to Christmas day and we're at my in-laws. We had to bring the dog because if we'd left her at home we'd surely return to messes everywhere. So now we're trying to open gifts with a dog that needs to go outside every thirty minutes. The dog is super soaking my in law's yard with intense projectile diarrhea and vomiting all over their carpet. Eventually it's clear that we're not going to be able to resolve the situation ourselves, so we pack up the baby, presents and severely dehydrated dog and head for the emergency vet.

After analyzing a stool sample for parasites, x-raying her abdomen for intestinal blockages and other tests, we realized the problem. We basically wasted $800 at the vet on Christmas and determined we're just really bad dog owners.

Remember how I cleared all that honeysuckle? Well, I hadn't gotten around to breaking it all down and removing it from the back of the yard yet. There was tons of it and the cold weather and newborn turned my attention elsewhere. Turns out amur honeysuckle is highly toxic to dogs. Like the entire plant. Roots, stems, leaves, berries, flowers, everything. What I thought was just our dog grabbing sticks to merrily drag around the yard and chew to her happy heart's content was actually something far worse. I essentially created endless piles of highly toxic but highly desirable dog toys, then trapped my dog in this yard with a nice new fence and thought I was providing her with a safe space. Turns out I imprisoned her in a toxic wasteland. Honeysuckle causes vomiting and diarrhea in dogs. Sometimes even comas and death.

Given how pervasive this honeysuckle is and how everyone around here has dogs, I'm surprised that I didn't know how bad this stuff was. Nobody I have asked in this area seemed to know either. I guess it's normally not an issue because most people don't have loose piles sitting around. But here is an FYI if you didn't know - honeysuckle will fuck your dog up. If you have it on your land, be sure your dog is never eating any part of it.

Juniper seems to be fine now and is enjoying a bland diet of boiled chicken and rice to get her gut in order. Removing this debris is now my highest priority. I won't make this expensive and potentially deadly mistake again.

tl;dr Had loads of chopped down honeysuckle lying around which the dog loved to chew on, causing her diarrhea and I couldn't figure out why. After a nearly $800 vet bill on Christmas, I have the answer.",22,8,tifu

Anyway so i got a 2ds xl with animal crossing and mario 3d land. I wanted a 3ds so it was perfect. And my brother got a drone. 

We test flew it and did a few laps, flips, and landings. That thing is good at handling but not the best at hovering. It would go to the side a little. This is important so remember that. 

So we had to go to our cousins house who is not far to wish them a merry Christmas. We brought our drone. My aunt has a couple of plants in her restaurant. Again important remember that. 

So we flew the drone and it was doing good in it. We flew it from one end to another end of the restaurant. Then i had this brilliant idea of taking off the drone right next to the PLANT.

 I take off with my goal being the other side of the restaurant. And when i took off the drone went to one side straight into one of her money plants. That $50 drone cut the stems of that plant so low before coming out and crashing into a wall.

 So there i am scared as hell about what will happen to me. I told my cousins who are adults not to tell my mom and dad if they come in because for obvious reasons. 

But when they came in my brother told them everything. Even when it got cut my brother ran and told my aunt. When my cousin and my other cousins fiance saw it there jaws dropped. And when my other cousin came she was shocked. We cleaned the mess up.

In the end i wasnt in trouble because when we went to say sorry to my aunt she said its just a plant stop overreacting. Then i played on my 2ds xl.

My sexuality came up, my love live (or lack there of) came up, and like always I kept my mouth SHUT; my brothers are like just tell us, I make the mistake of saying just wait till may 15th. 

Mayhem, everyone starts guessing what the date means - from engagements, to pregnancy, coming out to bringing my current (also non exisrent) partner home. Insisting that I need to tell them now as I'm family etc.

I refuse to comment, but my mum was clearly getting increasingly worried; now she's had bad mental health this year and It was at this moment I realised I would have to tell her. So I request a 30 min break, to allow myself a chance to build myself up to it and retreat to my bedroom. 

And cry. I cried so much you could have bathed in my tears, I was scared and nervous and pissed, and probably  every emotion you could think of, In my head this wasn't happening till may 15th. 

I recorded myself; crying and venting to my phone. And even sent copious amounts of voice notes to my  friends. I was a mess basically, at this point adrenaline was running through my body. I felt sober. 
I wasn't. I was nice drunk, the everything's good drunk. My brain just refused to register that. 

Not long after my brother and sister in law came up to check on me and apologise for being so pushy and calm me down, I appreciated it but still - I was now in a situation where I had to come out. Yes I could have kept my mouth shut. But that's not the kind of person I am. My mum was clearly worried and I promised her that she would know by the end of the night. 

So I did the only thing my brain could think of; dutch courage - except my dutch courage was a whole bottle of straight malibu in 10 minutes. 

To cut the story short my coming out looked something like this: I cried in her lap and told her this was a big thing for me, so let me take my time - she played bingo the whole time, as I explained to her I think I'm bi and I know she doesn't care but it's still a  big deal for me and I wasn't ready and basically just word vomited, whilst rocking back and forth and crying - she was still playing bingo but being supportive. - I then procceeded to fall of my bed, locked myself out of my bank account when she asked to borrow a fiver for her bingo, and somehow managed to go down stairs for an un-rememebered amount of time, talking about god knows what. Whilst also insisting she was NOT to tell anyone what was said. 

Now this is where the fuck up comes into play; remember all that alcohol I drunk? Remember the extra litre of straight malibu I chugged? The adrenaline? The fear? The emotional mess I was? Well I was no longer fun drunk, I was in a state drunk,  I was basically seeing jesus drunk

Somehow I managed to get into the downstairs toilet projectile vomited everywhere - seriously theres sick on the walls and floor -  and sat there crying for 45 minutes. I was insisting I needed to clean it up and apologising for being a mess, whilst sipping at a glass of water - that had appeared about half way through. 

It's hazy but eventually with the fams help I dragged myself up to bed and passed out. Not long woke up and saw my brother and sis in law off, the others are asleep and I'm trying to work out how I'm going to clean this bathroom without adding to mess.  

Sorry it isn't a big fuck up, but I hope you guys enjoyed it none the less. 

If you have any cleaning tips I'd appreciate it :)

TLDR; I spent the whole day drinking, and then backed myself into a corner to the point where I had to come out to my mother for mine and hers sanity, but chugged a litre bottle of malibu before doing so. 
Then projectile vomited all over the bathroom floor and walls and in the toilet.

t3_kkkzkr,TIFU by training myself to hate watching tv,"This past fall I started university which was great but as I started studying I had a really hard time focusing. I needed to study for a few hours but I kept turning on my phone. I would spend time watching netflix and tiktoks instead of studying and it wasn‚Äôt boding well for my grades.
To fix this, I decided to give myself a rule. I was not allowed to be on my phone/watch netflix unless I was eating at the same time. 
This worked really well and I was finally focusing on studying and watching netflix during my meals with a timed limit.
Unfortunately the problem came up once winter break started because I couldn‚Äôt watch tv/netflix anymore. Any time I try, I immediately feel very unproductive or hungry and I can‚Äôt even focus on the show. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks of break now and I still can‚Äôt stand sitting and watching tv.
tl;dr I only watched netflix while I ate, now I can‚Äôt watch netflix unless i‚Äôm eating",10,3,tifu
t3_kkkbgl,TIFU By leaving a beer can in the shower,"To start off yes I‚Äôm under age, but I barely drink. I still live with my parents and I can not but alcohol. My dad will let me have a beer with him sometimes (very rarely) and my mom said I she never wants to figure out I‚Äôve drank. Well... I was really board so I grabbed a beer and went up to my shower and drank it up there. I didn‚Äôt really enjoy it too much, but I left it in there on accident. My sister found it and told my mom.... on Christmas day.

My mom came down to my room and was extremely disappointed. She hadn‚Äôt told my dad yet, but the only real reason he would be mad is because it was one of my dads ‚Äúgood‚Äù beers. I am nervous that my mom will tell a bunch of people, ground me, or she will be unhappy with me for a long while.

TL;DR my sister found a beer can and now my mom is extremely unhappy. Now I‚Äôm scared for what‚Äôs to come.",40,26,tifu
t3_kkjacm,TIFU by going through my parent's trash,"So this happened on Christmas night.

My (30M) wife (28F) and I are visiting my parent's house for Christmas. Earlier in the week my dad had given each child and spouse $100 each in an envelope in place of doing stockings this year. My wife put hers in a safe spot and I put mine on top of the dresser in our room. A few days later my wife was cleaning up and thought she had looked in the envelope to make sure it was empy before she threw it away. Christmas came and gone and we were packing up to leave, when I noticed I didn't pack the money and couldn't find it. We searched through pockets, bags, and the house and couldn't find it. My wife vaguely remembered tidying up and states she might had thrown the envelope away a few days ago. So I decided to go through the trash in hopes of finding it. I calculated back the days and guestimated which bag it would have been in. I donned some disposal gloves and start digging. While digging I found a box of unopened toilet bowl cleaner tablets (the kind that turn the water blue each flush). 

Earlier that day it was brought up why my father refuses to use the master bathroom connected to their bedroom and instead uses a smaller hallway one. It is because my mother started using these blue toilet tablets and he can't stand the smell or sight of them. My mother's argument as to why she still uses them is because she does the cleaning of that bathroom, and that's what she likes.

Remembering my mother uses these tablets and assuming my father threw them away without her knowing I pull them out thinking it would be funny to stir the pot... Boy was I wrong. When I explained I was missing money and went through the trash I asked my mother why those toilet tablets were in the garbage and she lost it. She started yelling at my dad asking ""Do I have to start going through the trash regularly again"" and ""what else have you thrown away?"" Furious at him for throwing them away.

Apparently this has been an issue before in their marriage, that he would throw away things he doesn't like and I just caught him doing it again. I have never seen my mother that angry and yelling. After she left the kitchen where this all went down, my dad went to the trash can and took out a decorative ceramic Christmas cookie platter and said ""just to be safe"" as he set it back on the counter. (A plate of cookies was gifted to them on it).

As we left the next morning she was still upset at him. But on a high note we found the $100 in the trash!

Tl;dr: I went through my parents trash looking for misplaced money, and found my dad has been throwing away my mom's stuff without her knowing, causing a big fight.",23891,1147,tifu
